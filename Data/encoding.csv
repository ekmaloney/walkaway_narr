Now mind you I was primed and ready. That was my first day of quarantine and I work in a metaphysical setting and already heard about Trump not being who we think he is. But I didn't even know about the goodies just waiting to be found on YouTube. Egde of Wonder, 3D to 5D Consciousness, Elizabeth April and x22 Report quickly became my favorite channels although 4 months later I'm over 20 I check on. I am a retired special education teacher and early on in Trump campaigning, when he mocked the disabled reporter, that was it for me. That moment I bought that he's a complete jerk and I fell right in line on the hate train. Plus as a life long Democrat, Republicans never helped teachers at contract time...it was the Democrats. I thought Democrats worked to help the little guy while Republicans worked to protect their money with tax loopholes for themselves while living off the backs of middle class America. But then the virus came along and things just weren't adding up...I saw Pelosi calling everyone down to Chinatown that its no big deal. The next day Trump closed our borders to China and gets criticized as racist...then some weeks down the line try to make it seem what a fuck up he is and he didn't act fast enough. Whoah! Now the MSM manipulation is glaringly obvious to me. But thanks to David I know about the cabal, what evil they're trying to hide, and how MSM is designed for *programming* our minds and controlling how we think. When the veil shifts; everything shifts! Where once I couldn't stand looking at or listening to Trump, I see how he talks in codes coordinated with Q. I had heard of Q, now I was following Q. On one hand it was exhilarating to learn the real truth; on the other learning this truth is a nightmare. Then comes excitement...when I knew and got it...I couldn't wait to share with my family and friends. I was so naive...most of my family immediately wrote my news off as junk...conspiracy theory bull the whole nine yards. My girlfriend of 40 years and I do not speak on the phone anymore. My old teacher friends think something happened to my mind. It hurt my heart but couldn't stop what became my contract to fulfill. You see my life path number is 5...5 is freedom fighter. I started red pilling Mon. March 22...I'll never forget the first words out of my mouth: OMG...the ones we love and respect are bad...the ones we hate are the Patriots! Didn't matter...and to this day none that I'm aware of has remotely changed their minds. 2 women tried delving and they walked away still not getting it. I realized the MSM did a fucking job on dividing us. Mind you, my gf of 40 years is a retired high school English teacher and probably taught 1984 more than I can count and I asked her once you don't think we're in 1984??? Or worse??? I just don't get it. As the virus hell grew and it became apparent that the cities and states that had the worst issues were all dem controlled. Segway to the rioting...same thing...look at the dem candidate for president! There's something not right with Biden...and they still don't wake up! I actually came out to my people using these facts saying I just can't support what the dems are anymore...I'm a walkAway! And damn proud of that! I have one request. To combat the division in our country, it is time to plaster our homes, neighborhoods, towns, states with American flags again like we did for 9/11! Blessed be."

This is mineÉÉ (while trying to keep it as short as possible) I'm 51 years old. I was happily raised a Democrat by my schoolteacher/nurse mother and my stepfather who was a union tile worker in the Northeast. Democrats were the party of hard working patriotic Americans, and this was the truth. I worked hard like my parents taught me, having many jobs through high school and then college where I graduated with an Engineering degree from a state university. I was never indoctrinated by my schools or teachers back then and got a great education. Once I was voting age, I voted Democrat. After working for a large international company for many years, living and working in various countries, my appreciation for the opportunities the US had, and my love of America grew. I left the company I worked for and started my own business in 1997. Over 20 years it organically grew into a small but relevant company in the international power generation market. I was changed during the second Bush administration, and not for the better. I went further left before I went right. We were providing contractors in Iraq during the war to assist in rebuilding their power generation infrastructure. I had several employees there that I would Skype with every day. They would tell me of how the military was running around the place with truck loads of dollars giving the money away to bribe and pay off all the local tribes and governments there. It really infuriated me that our taxpayer money was squandered like that while there were so many in need back home. Then Obama came along promoting his promise of change for our country. It was exactly what I though the country needed, big change, and so I voted for Obama during his first term. Unfortunately the change never came. Identity politics made me think I was on a different planet, let alone America. Obama era regulations on my industry made it harder and harder for us to compete as a small company for jobs that we needed to survive. The playing field was no longer level. I felt like I got sold a bill of goods for voting for him, as nothing he did aligned with my values and the ÔChangeÕ never came. From my experience, the party had changed and was no longer the party for the little guy or working man. Seemed to me it was more the party of division, identity politics, and power. My first vote against the party came in 2012. Unfortunately Obama got his second term and things didnÕt get betterÉ.more of the same. Then 2016. An abrasive New Yorker came along that was a fighter, a winner, and above all a Patriot. All of the things that I thought were going wrong with this country he said he would fix if elected. He made sense to me and he got my vote. IÕm not a very religious person, but actually prayed the night of the 2016 election. Not for him to win, but for God to make the outcome of the election turn out to be what was best for our country. The rest is history. Since then, the Democrats in power have proven to not have the country in their best interest. They hate Donald Trump more than they love our great nation. I continue to pray now and then that God will do what is best for our country. I will accept the results of a fair election as GodÕs will, and support The President."

Even though he stood for a lot of what I valued I chose the other side. I've been an Independent ever since I turned 18 and have always valued the right to vote. I started to side with the left alot because I wanted people to have the same rights-equality. But in the last 3 months I saw a difference in how the left saw things and how they were handling it. Burning down the country and such hatred coming out for people who thought differently. No tolerance. It really shook me to my core and I just couldn't in good conscience be a part of it. My husband laughs at me because he is a big conservative and watching me get ""woke"" has been an adventure especially in regards to some of my family. I am grateful for this community and those who have chosen to ""walk away"". Knowing your not alone. I want this country to be a place my kids can grow but I'm worried where it is being taken. God bless all those who have seen the light!! _"

I have been harassed, cornered, and alienated because I am conservative. In the end of your gay, I respect you, if you have more skin melanin than me I respect you. I believe all lives and people matter and have felt this way for many years. My God tells me we are Òall precious in his sightÓ therefore I canÕt argue with the man upstairs.

Thank you for the courage youÕve displayed by speaking up. May God bless and protect each of you because IÕm sure you have or will face backlash. Today I faced some of that backlash myself, which has prompted this post. For 4 long years, IÕve watched one of my friends call our current President every vile and evil name in the book. IÕve never spoken up Ð sheÕs entitled to her opinion, right? But yesterday she posted a ÒmemeÓ showing President Trump playing golf and beside the picture were stats showing how many Americans died from Covid while he played 9 holes. So, I finally had the courage to speak up about the inconsistent way this President has been treated from almost any other President that I can remember by simply stating that President Trump is not the only President to play golf during a critical time in our country. I pointed out that it seems there has been one set of rules for him versus other Presidents. I went even further to say that I donÕt always like or agree with some of the things President Trump says nor the way he expresses himself, and instead tried to make the conversation about respect for the Office of the President rather than the individual. No matter who holds that Office, we should lift him/her up in prayer and respect the Office. She simply told me to block her as a friend. So Ð that is it in a nutshell. The Democratic party has mostly devolved into a party that doesnÕt care about you or your opinion unless you agree with them. That is NOT the America I want to live in. I pray that we all make our voices heard on November 3rd, and I pray that we can preserve the freedoms and integrity of this great country."

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3531283790224837,"IÕve been a part of this group for 2 years now, I think... more than 1 for sure. IÕve been reading everyoneÕs testimonials and LOVING them but I havenÕt had the guts to post my own. My story doesnÕt feel interesting, IÕm a horrible writer and I couldnÕt figure out what picture to use (seriously). Here goes: My parents illegally immigrated from Mexico (they're citizens now!). In the early Ô80s they headed up north to the current murder capital of America (Chicago) and a couple of years later I was born. Due to their educational levels, lack of English and illegal status we were poor, dirt poor, salt tacos poor. We lived in garages, basements, small apartments with other family members to get by. During this time my parents never complained or accepted handouts, even though they couldÕve because I am a natural born citizen, they didnÕt want them. Then came the Amensty of Ô86, God bless Ronald Reagan, a Republican, he changed their lives and mine. My parents got their green cards and now qualified for minimum wage (companies who hired illegal immigrants paid half of minimum wage and if anyone complained theyÕd threaten deportation, so they got away with slave wages), there was no more hiding or getting taken adavantage of. We got nicer things, better living arrangement but the thing with Chicago is that people notice when you have nice things so they take them, by force. We had our apartment set on fire, cars stolen, cars set on fire when they couldnÕt steal them. This is was all on top of the shootings and tripping over dead drug addicts on my way to school. The same Democratic politicians promising change in the Ô80s were failing, Lightfoot's failures aren't new. In Ô94 my parents made a hard choice and it was a choice I will be forever grateful for. They cleared out their savings, left everything and everyone they knew behind and moved to Texas. We were still poor when we got to Texas so we lived in what they called ghetto, but it was heaven compared to Chicago. Within a year my parents had enough to buy a house then I graduated from High School, joined the military and traveled all over the world. **I was a registered Democrat** I didn't know anything about politics beyond Dems are for minorities and Republicans are racist. I started out my time in the military under Bush Jr. and things were great, even with high deployment tempos we had morale. In 2008 I, the Democrat, voted for ""Hope and Change,"" I wanted to be a part of history. It took no time to see a morale decline in the troops. Everything was getting cut, our Commander in Chief didn't seem to like us, we were deploying with new rules of engagement that put us in more danger, there was little hope and the change sucked. In 2012 I flipped and voted Romney. I didn't love Romney but I couldn't stomach Obama. I was sad when he was announced the winner but I thought ""Oh well, it's just 4 years."" The damage done by the Democratic party in those 4 years cemented my Conservative status. I didn't vote Trump in 2016, I thought he was running as a joke. The man was a well known pro-choice, Hollywood loving Democrat so I wrote in Jesus. I've seen what President Trump has managed to accomplish since January of 2017. Even with the monkey poo being flung by the media, the House of representatives, Hollywood and the RINOS... he was never a joke. He loves this country, he loves all citizens (born and unborn, skin color be damned), he loves our military and I will proudly pull the lever for him on November 3rd, unless I vote early, then it'll be some time in October. Sorry this was so long! God bless y'all and keep up the good work____"
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3531246620228554,"Hello everyone! IÕve been a member of the group for a long time but IÕve never shared my story. I guess everyone would consider me a WalkWith instead of a WalkAway. I have always been an Independent voter with a moderate conservative take on life agreeing with different things on each side of the aisle. In a NutshellÉ I am a Christian Conservative who loves God, Our Awesome Country, and Our Flag. I love and accept all People regardless of Race, Sexual Orientation, Religious Beliefs, or Political Party. I choose my friends based upon their Character and nothing else! I have great friends from all walks of life. I support our Military and our Police. I believe in the 1st and 2nd Amendments, WomenÕs Rights, EVERYONEÕS Rights, IÕm Pro-Life, I believe that ALL Lives Matter, and I support Economic and Energy Sustainability. All of this being said, I have to be very careful about what I do and say on Social Media because my husband and I are small business owners of 3 micro businesses, and Social Media can destroy businesses as much as they can help businesses. My husband is a vocational school teacher and we all know that a teachers salary is not great, so my husband calls me his ÒPimpÓ as I send him out to do side work for clients (HVAC, Electrical, Carpentry, etc), and for our private event Disc Jockey company. I am an Event Planner and Wedding Officiant. So we stay busyÉ Well at least we used too! We have been experiencing issues on two fronts. First all, the Hypocritical Hate from the far left. Those who criticized conservatives who didnÕt want to compromise their religious beliefs to provide services, now those liberals are not wanting to work with those conservatives whose beliefs donÕt align with theirs! This has affected our businesses not necessarily from potential clients but from other vendors in our fields. We have lost what we call ÒFriendÕorÕsÓ, Vendor Friends, in our industry when they have discovered we lean right. No room for civil discussion on what we support and donÕt support. If we donÕt support the Big D 100% they donÕt want to discuss anything or work with us. Second, COVIDÉ We went from what was in January looking to be the best year on the books in 10 years, to one of the worst ever by the end of March. The entertainment / wedding industry has taken a huge hit and to say the least having no events for 4 months has hit us hard. Being micro businesses we did not qualify for any type of assistance. The saving grace for us is that my husband is still getting his teachers salary, he has been able to do side work for people while school has been closed, and I am still able to perform wedding ceremonies for those who want to have small family ÒelopementsÓ. We know it could have been much worse for us as we have watched several of our FriendÕorÕs lose their businesses because of the Covid Shutdown. Those Vendors blame Trump for all of their Woes instead of those that they should be taking a hard look atÉ the Democrats and themselves. In SummaryÉ I WalkWith everyone here regardless of ÒwhoÓ you are. I WalkWith you because you have the Strength of Character to follow your own path and to not let someone else dictate to you how to conduct your life. I hope you WalkWith me because I do the same. I humbly ask that you support all Small / Micro Businesses that have been affected by the Liberal Hate and the Covid Shutdown in our country so that they can survive to work another day, and to grow our economy and our great country. This year I will once again Vote for Trump to continue to Make America Great Again! God Bless You ALL!"

WHY would my Dad (father of 3 daughters, brother of 3 sisters, grandfather of 4 granddaughters, Uncle to 5 nieces) vote for this man?!

Actually, I should say stuck in Victoria, Australia, as my Leftist state is holding us all captive! I am not allowed to leave my neighbourhood, let alone the country. I feel compelled to write this walkaway story to warn everyone in America of what could happen if they let the Democrats take power of the Whitehouse again. Victoria is the most Leftist state in all of Australia. Our COVID-19 response has been disastrous under this Leftist state government regime. RT recently wrote an article about how we have the strictest lockdown in the world! I can confirm that is true! We have had about 247 deaths nationwide (to date), all mainly within nursing homes. The Premier of Victoria decided that we are now in 'A state of Disaster' and enforced a stricter lockdown on us. BTW, this is only happening in Victoria, not the rest of Australia. We have been in Stage 3 Lockdown for 5 straight months. A few days ago, they put us into Stage 4 for an additional 2+ months. We don't really know if it will end there, as the Premier is threatening Stage 5 if this Stage 4 is not successful. We don't really know what that means, but he said it would ""radically change the way we live"". Basically, we are all under house arrest - Police have the right to enter your home without a warrant. We have curfews and can only leave our homes once a day, for one hour (although they do not want you leaving your house at all!). Masks are mandatory outdoors and indoors. Nearly every business is closed, so millions of people have been unemployed for the length of this Lockdown. We have been told there will be meat shortages soon, as more businesses were forced to close as per the restrictions of this Stage 4. We are not allowed to leave our suburbs and we are not allowed to see friends or family. This is inhumane! And now, here is the kicker... Our Premier announced that our lives will NOT go back to normal until EVERY Victorian gets the new vaccine they are working on for COVID-19! Yes, you heard that right. We cannot get out of lockdown until we get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate! I do not want to be forced into being injected with a rushed vaccine that has not been tested. We are clearly the guinea pigs of some very sinister plans. This is not normal! Australia does not have a Bill of Rights like America. We have been easily controlled and whipped into submission with the threat of this virus. Please share this story! People need to understand what is happening here. We cannot allow these maniacs to implement this agenda. This affects us all, not just Victoria!"

Socially aware of people in need, wanting to help when I can. About 10 years ago I started to wake up to the fact that the Democratic party was changing. Had changed drastically. That I had been changing along with it. An insidious cancer slowly growing and taking hold. I woke up and realized they now did not represent what I believed in. The change had been slow and I had followed along like a sheep. I have to say my husband opened my eyes and I have been a registered Republican and a conservative at heart ever since. My heart breaks for this country, MY country, OUR COUNTRY. We must take it back and educate. After all, that's what teachers do."

IÕve always been a little rebellious so I refused to identify as either party. My grandfather died right before my 9th bday and later in life I realized I remember every word he ever said to me and most of it was political or related to politics in some way I didnÕt understand at the time. I learned about the New World Order before I learned about Adam and Eve. Papaw always told me I would be the attorney and the politician in the family. I watched my aunt get so deep into what could possibly happen in our country (and world) at some point that she alienated everybody in her life and she rarely leaves her house. She lives in a world of fear, depression, and anger. I saw my dad going down a similar path but I was able to step in before it got too bad. I swore I wanted no part of politics. I have been silent about politics my entire life and refused to have a conversation about it. I always kept up with it though. In 2016 it became harder to be quiet. I had a life long friend that posted Òif you support Trump just delete me,Ó so even though she had no idea who I voted for, I deleted her for the lack of her acceptance of free speech and choice. I also had a good friend that I worked with that was a hardcore Democrat. We were opposite in every way but we respected each other. When Trump won he missed a half day at work. He came in, went to the office of the owner of this large corporation (who is a huge Trump fan), said something very ugly about the election, and an hour later.... well letÕs just say he was offered a comfortable severance to leave his 20yr job. I realized then the trend in attitudes from the Democrats I knew. I am the mother to 4 half black daughters so I am expected to think a certain way, my children are expected to think a certain way. We donÕt!! I love my country to the point that I have a flag on my fridge so my boys can say the pledge every morning before we homeschool. I still cry every time IÕm at a game and hear the National Anthem. Both of my grandfathers fought for our country. My dad fought for our country. I could keep this list going for a while. I have raised my daughters to value the opportunities being American has given us all. They have never liked being set apart. There was a group here that awarded black children every time they got a report card if they had certain grades. My girls got invitations every 9 weeks to come to the dinner they had for the kids and they would throw them away because Òthey didnÕt want to be rewarded because of their skin color.Ó I always encouraged them to go if they wanted to. They will quickly tell you they donÕt feel like theyÕve had less opportunity or that their opportunities have been made more difficult than their white friends. They have a crap ton of student loan debt like everybody else, that doesnÕt discriminate __. Have we had instances of racism, of course. My daughter was ostracized from a comp class in college after being told she ÒwasnÕt black enoughÓ because they didnÕt like her more conservative views. I lived in a suburb (not a nice one) right outside Chicago and there we received more racism from the black community. We arenÕt denying it exists, itÕs just how we allow it to affect our lives, we donÕt. This election period I have had to delete half of my friends on fb, some IÕve know my whole life. IÕve been told IÕm a crappy mom and raised my kids Òtoo whiteÓ _____, IÕm racist, IÕm a bigot, IÕm an embarrassment, I should be ashamed, I forced my children to think like me (not true at all. IÕve always encouraged they do their own research), etc. IÕve even been told my daughter who is pregnant is naming her baby a name thatÕs Òtoo white,Ó sheÕs naming him after her dad. My 7yr old niece and I were in a store and I spoke to an acquaintance, the woman responded with Òracist b****.Ó ThatÕs how far this has gotten for me. This is not the country I want my grandchildren to be raised in. This isnÕt what soldiers put their lives on the line for. After the realizations I had from the 2016 elections (I did vote for Trump) and everything that has happened during this one with my peers, the Democratic Party, BLM, ANTIFA, and the media, I can now say I am a die hard #walkwith republican!!!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3539829052703644,"Hello everyone! I'm a #WalkWith. All my life I have been a Republican Conservative. At first the news did not really appeal to me. However, when I started taking History and World History, I became more interested. For years I have been doing my research and never once voted Democrat. I almost did with Obama until I heard two words that gave me the most concern. Those words? ""Fundamentally Change."" Change yes, but to fundamentally change? That made me nervous. I voted against him both times. Trump wasn't even my first choice come 2016, Ben Carson was. I liked how he was soft spoken, intelligent, and worked on the front lines in medical care. However, when it came time to vote, I voted Trump. Digging more in to the Democratic party only left me more uneasy. I remembered back even before the Clintons when gun laws were starting to be put in place I felt it was a slippery slope. Some I agreed with, others, not so much. Now its just ridiculous. When they started with the ""political correctness"" I also knew that was going to be a very slippery slope. So forgive me if I'm not exactly politically correct. I have never had issues with the LGBT+ community, nor with the Black communities, or anything of that nature. Yet even though I treat others as I wanted to be treated, with dignity, respect, and an open mind, I was being called racist, homophobic, misogynist, and everything else you could possibly come up with. Thankfully through school, where even there I was severely bullied, it made me get a tough skin. Hardly anything offends me. I love a good debate, to discuss issues, to hear other points of views. As the culture grew worse and me being often times left to fend for myself against others, I had to ask ""why would I want to stop talking about my point of view?"" when it came to being off the clock at work in the break room? I couldn't believe I was told, ""don't talk about that"" when I brought up a valid point. Under Obama, I lost the healthcare that I had been with and liked to something I hated, and had to pay more for. I knew then things were only going to get worse. At first, it was little things. ""Say disabled instead of handicapped"". ""say African-American instead of Black."" ""This is now a gun-free zone"". I was grateful for the cop that came to the school, in fact I remember his name, Officer Burt. It was my first interaction with a cop outside of home when my father worked as a Corrections Officer in Washington State. He also taught Martial Arts and though he didn't have to, he taught me the simple punch which I will always be grateful for. Now to see those cops being belittled, defunded, disbanded, and more, I want to cringe. I want to say NO MORE. I wanted to give both sides in 2016 the opportunity to speak to me. It was there I met a gentleman at the rally, an older white man, and he was extremely enthusiastic. I asked where he came from, he said Texas. As we got to talking just a simple conversation about military, and such like that, he stated that he felt the Democrats had betrayed him. His words, not mine. I was so happy to see his enthusiasm and a group of us just started talking with him, in a welcoming, open way. We laughed, we joked, we talked serious issues, and we spoke of both sides of the aisle. Some anti-Trump people were there, and we let them be. The only thing we asked of them was to ""please put the American flag higher than the Hillary flag out of respect of the flag and those of us who have fought for your freedoms."" Simple request, and they did. We told them thank you and went on with conversation. It was a very contagious time. Then Secret Service came up to us in the line. I asked about those that served not as soldiers but also as First Responders? I had been a Firefighter for 6 years from 98 - 04. Nothing is ever really done for those that have been on the front lines here at home, but almost everything for those veterans that fought for our country. Do not get me wrong, my father was in in the Vietnam War so I appreciate the service of those brave people. However, I had run in to burning buildings, had to witness things most don't or are shielded from. So I had asked simply ""what about First Responders?"" The man nodded and said, ""I'll be right back"". When he returned, he pulled me, and the vets around me out of line and told us to go up to the front and checked the line for any others. We were literally taken 15 feet from our now President and told, ""If anything happens, you all are on our front line."" They gave us a briefing and we took it to heart. We had sworn the same oath after all, uphold the Constitution and defend it against all threats foreign and domestic. I have never been relieved of that oath. However, standing in front of President Trump, I listened to my gut. My gut told me that he was a decent man, no not perfect, but that he meant what he was saying. Hillary never shown up. I dug into her more, and the more I found, the more disgusted I was. I kept (truncated)"

I grew up a Democrat and voted Democrat since i could vote (2000) was my first presidential vote. Late in the last term of Obama i started to see things i didn't see before that wasn't right with me. In 2016 i made up my mind. I was changing parties and i don't regret it one bit. I am proud of our president and what he has done and continues to do for our country.

I didn't like Hillary though and I didn't like Trump in 2016. I voted for Gary Johnson, a third-party candidate and it wasn't a wasted vote because Trump won the state of North Carolina by 173,000+ votes over Hillary. Well, I still don't like Trump but I am going to vote for him this time. Why? Because the 2018 mid-term election opened my eyes to the dangers of socialism taking over this country. We can't let Joe Biden win the election! I don't believe socialism will take over if Biden wins, but a Biden victory will bring us one step closer and make it easier for a socialist government to take over years from now. Right now I am more worried about democrats taking over both chambers of Congress than I am about Biden winning. I am still a liberal, but I will be voting Trump in November!"

IÕm the product of two hard working immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who raised me to believe that Democrats were for the poor and Republicans were for the rich. It wasnÕt until I was watching a (Hispanic network) with my mother one night where Trump was giving a speech and it was being translated to Spanish, I was shocked to see that what he was saying was not even close to what was being said in Spanish. Immediately, I turned to my mother and told her that they were not accurately translating what he was saying. Thereafter, I began listening to more of Trumps speeches watching Fox News and reading about republican policies. I began to see how much lies, hate and corruption the left stood for. This is when I realized how mistaken I was and that my beliefs completely aligned with those of Republicans. Fast forward, IÕm proud to say my mother is now a Republican as well as my 18yr old daughter who just registered to vote this upcoming election. Lastly, I wanted to share that even though I was born in the USA when ever anyone would ask Òwhat are youÓ I would say ÒDominicanÓ I guess I saw that as honoring my parents.

So I figured I didn't need to vote at all. Here comes Trump.. As I watch liberals make Trump the laughing stock and publicly humiliate him, degrade him, I felt a strong anger towards them for making fun Trump, who I didn't even know what he stood for and why he was running for president so I still didn't vote in 2016.

For some background, IÕm a German/Polish/French Canadian-American. I also happen to fall under the LGBT+ umbrella. I pride myself in being bilingual, an active volunteer in my community, and acting as a big brother by mentoring physically and emotionally abused kids who lead childhoods similar to my own upbringing. IÕve spoken publicly on topics ranging from child abuse, sex workers, and adaptive-living strategies for people with mental and physical disabilities to vaccination efficacy, the importance of family wellness, and family planning. I started my life as a faithful Democrat. I never ÒchoseÓ them as my party, per se Ð I just had been taught that to be a Republican meant you were generally racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. It had been drilled into me from day one that the people that supported the GOP were usually rich, old, white folks. They were portrayed as a group to hate; to fear, even. As such, I fell into leading a democratic-governed life. I even voted for HRC, as repulsive as I found her, simply because I could not stand DJT. The media made him out to be a sworn enemy to people like myself. In recent years, IÕve begun to question where I fall on the political spectrum. I used to classify myself as left-of-center, or Òchaotic neutralÓ, as some call it. I just now know that I cannot continue to sit neutral while the radical left causes chaos. I cannot blindly support the ever-increasingly questionable tenets of the Democratic party. I cannot sit idly by while this country is destroyed from within. I support peaceful protest, but cannot condone rioting and looting. I support free speech for ALL, not just the far right or far left. I support the right to own and bear arms. I stand with the police. I stand for veterans. I stand for border control. I stand for each American to have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as declared by the Bill of Rights. I stand for America. I will no longer allow myself to be bullied into being far-left Ð because being a Democrat is no longer enough. They demand militant left, and nothing less. I will not stand for an America that does not represent me - and the Democratic party no longer represents me."

While I did not vote for Obama the first time, I thought , well maybe he will do some good. So, I gave him a chance. I was disappointed to say the least. Obama winning the White House the 2nd time was my turning point. I saw him as a threat to America and the freedoms we so cherished. The freedoms that many of our soldiers defended and died for over the years. I saw him dividing us and turning us against each other. As Americas first black president he had the opportunity to mend the racial divisions of the past and he failedÉ eight years and he only made things worse. I saw him apologizing to other countries for our actions, I saw him defending criminals over our police officers. I saw him doing nothing to protect our borders, allowing illegals to come into our country without taking the proper trajectory. I saw my 401(k) losing funds and our economy sinking fast. I saw him take from our military and weaken our countries sovereignty. The list goes on and on. It was obvious he was putting America last. I knew our country was in trouble, The democratic party has gone rogue and we needed someone to step up to the plate and put America first. I prayed that this would happen. In June 2015, my prayers were answered. Successful businessman, Donald J Trump announced his run for President of the United States of America as a Republican. Right from the start I knew he was the right man for the job. His no nonsense, tough and confident attitude was just what American needed to bring us back to the front of the line. A businessman is just what we needed. Donald J Trump was always a patriot who loved our country. I believed in him and his ability to make a difference for the American people.

I cannot and will not vote for a Democrat. It goes against everything I believe in. Is Trump harsh and crass at times? Absolutely. Does he have a bit of an ego? For sure. Do I believe that he loves this country ? I do. My eyes began to really open when Covid came on the scene. Came right on the heels of the impeachment. I started Ò connecting the dotsÓ if you will. So much started making sense. Trump was responsible for every bad thing in America. Somehow, he was supposed to become a doctor overnight in order to control this virus . Somehow, racism was all his fault too. Along with all Republicans. Was there anything GOOD at all that this man had done in almost four years of service to our country? According to the media, there wasnÕt. He does not take a salary. He puts up with more than any other US President has ever had to. He wants to protect our borders. He wants only LEGAL citizens to receive benefits in America. He had a booming economy.. until Dems had other plans to destroy it. Why? To bring him down. DoesnÕt matter to them who suffers as a result. Who goes hungry, who loses their home, whose business closes. That is evil, plain and simple. People who would be willing to watch fellow Americans suffer in order to bring down a President they hate. And why do they hate him? Because he cannot be bought, persuaded, or bamboozled. He knows who is in the swamp, and he knows how to drain it. They despise that. ItÕs no longer Òbusiness as usualÓ. He is not a politician nor will he play politics. I am a proud Republican. I will gladly vote for Trump in 2020. This time, I will vote for him because I DO believe in him. I am so happy my eyes are open! I want to see him make America Great Again!

I am a first generation American. My parents are immigrants from Germany. They met here in the states. My birth father(thatÕs the nicest name I will give him) became a citizen as a young boy. My amazing Mom did not become a citizen until 2005 (she moved here as a teenager). Politics was not a topic growing up in my household as a youngster (i am the youngest out of 4). My mom couldnÕt vote and my birth father was a felon and couldnÕt vote either. Fast forward to when I was 12 and my mom got remarried (still thank god for him 30 years later). My first introduction to politics came from MY Dad __. My mom was open to talking politics but only about structure of the government and major topics . But she was admit about just the topic . She made sure my father did not ÒswayÓ me one way or the other. It was MY job to choose what I believed in and willing to fight for #amazigparents After 9/11 my mother had a hard time traveling out of the country with her German passport. Although she would do these trips 4 to 5 times a year for work, it now became a hassle for her . Being held in customs for hours , searched etc . She had enough. She had lived in this country for 40 years , owned homes , paid taxes , owned a business and said it was time for her voice to be heard. She did it , and became a citizen in July of 2005. We threw a huge party and celebrated her new voice. Fast forward to now. My parents are so amazing (I can never say it enough) and are always open to dialect . My Dad , like myself is a Republican and as our conversations got deeper my Mom was listening and as of 3 years ago changed from a Democratic vote to Republican vote. Her heart and God has lead her to what her real passions are now and all the lessons she taught me as child. I have been a Republican since I first registered to Vote. It will NOT change. I now have an 18 year old son and this is first election ... and just like my parents, I lead him To topics and how the government works. However , I leave it to God to lead him to his choice . He is listening !!! Please make sure you have conversations with your children . Do not force your opinion on them ... I promise you they WILL watch your actions , they WILL judge your heart.

As Facebook shows I'm Abigail but I prefer to be called Abby. I was born and raised in North Carolina and am proud to have been the daughter of a good old fashion white hill Billy redneck father and immigrant Filipino Mother. My household has always been republican and I'm proud to say I am 4 generation republican. This for me is not in connection of walking away but more so a group for like minded people. Thank you for having me."

Voting #Trump2020 this year because I believe in the individual rights afforded to each and every one of us. IÕm tired of seeing the radical socialist left dragging our country into chaos.
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3539422959410920,"Hi. My name is Kelli. I have my niece in the first picture, and my youngest granddaughter in the second. This is my #walkaway story. I am a lifelong republican. I come from a family of them. I never really thought about it much, really. Just vote for who you like. Until yesterday. I had a democratic friend who was actually voted into the NC House of Representatives a few years ago. He was only there 1 term, but when he was elected, I congratulated him because he was a friend. I had went to school with him. Yesterday, I had put up a post about Trump agreeing with Dr. Stella. It wasn't a big deal to me. I have posted a lot of Trump supporting posts. This ""friend"" literally told me to go inject myself with clorox on this post. I responded that I was praying to God that he wasn't referring to me. He was. Mind you, I am a 3 time suicide survivor. He is basically telling me to go kill myself. This is why I will never vote Democrat."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3531041670249049,"I love the stories I read here so decided to share mine. I am embarrassed of part of it. The post will be a little long and a bit off-topic to explain my situation. I grew up in a hardcore democrat family. I was told that the democrats are for poor people, which my family was, and the republicans were only for the rich. I believed that to be true, why would my family lie. I voted democrat in every election up to Obama. I knew there was something about him I didn't like. He talked too slick and smooth. He was like a great used car salesman about to sell you a lemon. I did some research and did not like his record as a senator. I did not vote in 2008. This is where I go off topic a bit, but it is important. In 2010 my wife left me and took my kids. She could not cope with my job which was 24/7 and caused me to be a miserable person. I fell into a deep depression and, long story short, went into a downward spiral that ended with me being a heroin addict. I robbed 2 cab drivers in one day for drug money. The next morning I felt so much guilt and disgust in myself that I went to my family and got clean, cold turkey. I turned myself in for my crimes, admitted everything, and accepted my 7 year sentence (served 6 from 2012 through 2018) like a man. I value the time I spent incarcerated because I used it to educate myself. I was in a program called NJ STEP which is a college program. I had professors from Rutgers and Princeton and carried a 4.0 GPA. I started reading a lot about politics and was surprised at what I had discovered. The democrats are not for poor people. Their policies are meant to keep us in our place. There is no room for advancement. With their ever increasing socialist views it is getting worse. They want to tell us what we can have, when we can have it, and how we can use it. They want to enslave us, which is no surprise from the party of slavery. I saw that the republican party has policies that, while on the surface seem anti-poor, are actually policies to help us lift ourselves up. Work hard and succeed. I fell in love with then candidate Trump's campaign and his messages. he was and is all about America first. Something the democrats are far from. I din't get to vote for our great president in 2016.I did vote for him in the primary in NJ. It was so great voting again. I believe it is among our greatest freedoms. I cannot wait to vote for him in the general election this November. I do fear that they are going to force mail in voting to try and steal the election. We all must stand up against that and demand that it does not happen. Lastly, while I am definitely no longer a democrat and will never vote for a democrat again, I do not consider myself a republican. I am an American that believes in the US Constitution and will always vote for the candidate that best represents that. God bless all of you and God bless America."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3531003610252855,"You might have a similar story, but here is mine. Our family was dirt poor, my folks grew up in the dirty 30's, farmers in rural South Dakota. They learned a hard work ethic from their parents who also were farmers. My Father was conservative. My Mother grew up in a very strong Democratic family who all were very close. My Mother's closest sister my Aunt Marion was Democratic Chairwoman in Clark County Nevada. She also worked for Senator Howard Cannon in Nevada. She was married to my Uncle Paul and he was well connected in Las Vegas. They were very well off and of course huge supporters of the Kennedy family and knew them personally. That being said, I was born with the initials JFK, yet it was before the nation really knew who he was. But studying his life, I quickly became a fond follower as did most of the nation of who JFK was. In my early teens I was the founder of the Young Democrats in our county. Attended many conventions, and worked campaign staffs for Sen George McGovern, Sen Jim Abourzek, Governor race for William Dourghty, I was pretty well entrenched in the Democratic Party. I always had a deep respect for Seniors and their life stories, history, and I remember a great conversation I had one day with a elderly man who I deeply respected. He shared many thoughts of why that someday I would leave the Democratic Party. Actually I thought this guy had lost his mind because there was NO WAY I would ever leave the Democratic Party. I hated Republicans. I considered them snobish rich people who were not anything like me. But after the years went by, in my early adult life I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. Over time things really changed with me as I grew in the Lord and asked Him for guidance in my life, for wisdom as a Father, Christian, Man, Husband, He did just what I prayed and asked for. The first thing He did was to open my eyes on the subject of Abortion. Now I have to say I considered Abortion off the table discussion. My Sister had one and it was deeply a NO TALK subject around our family. But it was not just Abortion, it became next our Nations Defense and I observed just how Democratic administrations say from 80's on really did not do much or hurt our military. Now I admit, I voted for Jimmy Carter the 1st time but I did not vote for him the 2nd time nor did I ever vote for a Democrat again. I heard a ABC news reporter ask President Reagan ""Why did you leave the Democratic Party"" The President replied: ""I never left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me"". Bingo! That was exactly how I had felt over time. The Democrats have continuously moved away from just about every position I believed in my heart. The platforms at conventions continued to me seemingly were anti-God, anti-American and to this day it continues on. The very last Democratic hopeful I would have even considered supporting for was former Asst Sec of Defense and US Senator Jim Webb (former US Combat Marine) and the Democrats ran him out on the rail because he does not fit their liberal, extremest ideals. No, sadly the Democratic party is NOT the party of my Grandmother, nor my Mother who were HST Democrats. That party is long gone. And so am I. Like President Regan, I never left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me. BTW One thing my Mother always did say. You don't vote for the Party you vote for the person who is best qualified for the job. She had a LOT of wisdom. I promise you this, if she were alive today she would say TRUMP 2020"

Sadly im 41 years old and a natural born citizen who refused to vote. The reason was I just felt I wasnt educated enough to make a right decision for me. I was never pressured as to what side I should be rallying for . My father was/is a hard worker his entire life and made sure he always did the right thing . To this day i still have no clue who he sides with. But I know he chooses to live the American dream. I remember sitting in a restaurant when Obama was elected and was ecstatic that we finally had a black president. I thought to myself, ""how amazing "". And again not knowing which side Obama was even on _____ . I was just hoping for the country that this would mean a big change . Bring us to 2016 I was super happy Trump won , I could care less about what the media said, i was amazed how much he LOVED America, that I became fascinated.

My brother was eleven years older than me so as a single parent in 1947 it was a really heavy burden on her. Of course being from the south we were always democrats. I went to work when I was 14 years old. My brother joined the Army when I was 8 years old. It wasn't an easy life but we made the best out of it. I married my husband in 1965 and we just celebrated 55 years of marriage. He has probably always been a conservative and has voted Republican for years. I was still old school as my mother loved Jimmy Carter, because we lived in Georgia and I voted for him. Just last year I heard my husband talking to our oldest son and my husband told my son that for many years that each time we voted we cancelled out our vote because he voted Republican and I voted Democrat. I woke up somewhere down the line because I did vote for Bush. But when I really woke up is when I didn't vote for Obama for either terms!! That is when I got really angry to see what Obama was trying to do to the USA!! It was appalling to me that one could be a POTUS and hate the USA and the American people at the same time. The more I researched the more angry I became!! I guess you could call me an independent before this wake up call because I always voted with my heart. The Democratic party of today is NOT the Democratic party I grew up with. These Democrats are nothing but evil and my heart does not support evil to any extent!!

I was raised Catholic taught to respect our elders and neighbors and those we didn't even know. Give a nod or hey if you made any kind of eye contact in passing. Fast forward to Bush vs. Dukakis I was full in for Dukakis had the Lick Bush t-shirt the whole bit. Voted for him even voted for Clinton. Until the PMRC came about. Tipper was and accomplished censorship of musians. Those labels are censorship. This is when I first started figuring out their lies.its ok if I do this but not you. Those double standards. In 2005 I met my future wife she was a Christian and brought back to Christianity, I had left catholic church behind years ago but still went to mass with my parents. Anyway this is where I started reading about being a good steward. The left will always demand every single person to save the planet. Few actually do anything about it. I learned that more Christians really care about the world and not in some crazy we need to get rid of oil way. But in a silent way, just picking up after oneself and others. I also learned that its not our jobs to condem others that break the laws we are to leave that to the authorities, we are to love one another as our own. And forgiveness oh such a powerful tool from God along with his grace. I have seen this country go from segregation to we are all one back to labeling everyone back to segregation. That is what the left has and still is doing. They want the labels that way they can keep us separated and controlled. Peace be with y'all."

All different but we have respect for one another as a human beings. My story is simple. I never claimed to be affiliated with any party. I actually thought politics were just stupid and annoying. It was not until Obama became President that I started waking up. I could just not get on board with him. It seemed he was causing more division than Unity. I tolerated him for 8 years. Then when I seen that Hillary was running. I picked up my head and said. NO! This Woman scared me to no ends. I had already done research on her. She just could not win. So, I went and finally registered to Vote. And indeed voted for President Trump. But even I was very skeptical in him winning. When Trump claimed Victory. I knew then our lives were going to change forever. The left who once supported and liked Trump as a business man. Had turned on him completely. The question I had then was why? So I started digging. And found out a lot and why it is so detrimental that he win in 2020. We as the People have got to stand together. We are in a war, a war to save our Freedom. I feel very blessed to be able to read all of your stories. You all give me hope! You all give America Hope. God Bless ________"

I was raised in an independent household which leaned towards the right but my mother many times voted against who my father voted for. We were taught to think for ourselves. Me personally considered myself as independent and not follow any party. Then met Mark, who could tell you who the president was but not much more. I encouraged him to watch a little of CNN and FOX NEWS. I did not know what I was doing at the time but felt everyone should know what is going on in our country. Well, I created a MONSTER __. It only took a couple of days for him to get interested and now we watch Fox news 24/7. I am not lying. He gets out of bed and immediately turns on Fox. We got married 6 weeks ago and he works the 3pm to 12 shift. Every single show is now recorded and we watch them when he gets home. Every so often I will set my foot down and he will watch an ID show. Anyway, my husband registered to vote for the first time in his 52 years!

I just had to say it is so flipping uplifting to read your posts. Here in southern California I'm surrounded by insanity, when i go on social media i feel like I'm going crazy because of the ignorance on display. Turn on the tv and what do i get? More craziness. I've always loved sports, they were such a good escape from the struggles of life and now i feel like a member of the kkk when i watch a basketball game. I hate being a Lakers fan knowing our star is a Chinese shill. But again, i turn on Rush, i read your stories and i am reminded that there is still sanity left. I'm including a picture of my son, he's a rainbow baby about to be 8 months old. He is already told daily that gov't is not the solution, it is the problem. He knows the media is a bunch of commie hacks. That he will be able to run his life better than some jackass in Washington and that commies aren't real people. Kind of kidding about the last one.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3529213687098514,"IÕve been a conservative since I was about 16 years old. I was in a speech and debat class that required me to research both sides of an arguement so as to be prepared to defend either side. In this class I debated issues like abortion, criminal justice, death penalty, welfare and social programs, civil rights and more. Investigating both sides of an argument it became very clear to me that I was a conservative. Since then I joined the local young republicans and worked on many campaigns: local, state, and Presidential. I grew up in California and was always surprised at how often I would have discussions with people who believed they were a democrat yet held conservative beliefs. Most people over the years that I have debated political issues were not well informed on either side of the argument and in fact often argued by emotion. When I would present facts they could not dispute, I was called a racist, bigot, or told I only care for the rich. I grew up poor, have grown up in a heavily integrated community and have always had friends of all races, I am in an interracial marriage, many of my closest friends are gay. The name calling and overly emotional responses always shut down intelligent conversations. Over the years it seems to have gotten worse. Many of the social issues plaguing our country today are manufactured to create victims who feel perpetually offended. As soon as the rest of us get used to the new ÒnewspeakÓ acceptable to debate these issues, they change it again and conservatives find themselves playing catch up to even be part of the discussion. This is by design so that we always seem to be out of touch and intolerant. I am filled with so much hope to see so many stories of great Americans that the Democrat party has lied to and made to feel like a marginalized victim wake up and realize that the conservatives are the ones actively fighting for your rights and freedoms. I want to encourage all of you to keep having the scary conversations, investigate both sides of these issues, and never debate out of anger. Thoughtfulness will win many more to our side and we are THE SILENT MAJORITY!! I #walkwith all of you and thank you for your vulnerability in sharing your stories. Bless you all! ______"

I was raised with my father and all his brothers being vets, come from that side of the family mainly Christian vets. However then you have the others side and one offs, they really had no values or morals, yet always felt they were owed something from everyone else. I also grew up in a heavy democratic state NM. While my dad was a vet he was also a ""hippie"". Talk about confused trying to figure it all out __. My dad always taught me and all of us kids to ALWaYS make my own mind up, look into things for yourselves. While I knew he was registered republican, he didn't fall into the typical view people try to make them out to be. When it was time to register I tried to refused to "" either"" party I registered independent. Once I meet and married my husband who was a very outspoken republican and a pastors kid I was tired of not having an option in the primary elections, so I changed to republican. We have grown over the years and I finally have made my husband realize that we are more ""libertarian"" then falling in line with a 2 party system. We are both registered republicans, however did not vote Trump in 16 we did and do really like Johnson.( This did not make my father in law happy__) However after this 4 years we may not agree with his methods and the way he says things at times, we both will be voting Trump this 2020! People do not realize that it has been the tantrum throwing, rude, and awful way they treat people that make us know there is no way to vote Dem. I honestly feel bad and pray for people who believe they are helping by being Dem.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3529095160443700,"I just wanted to introduce myself with this post. Growing up I never really stopped to think about political issues. I was from a rural part of Texas north of Dallas ~75 miles near the Texas/Oklahoma border. I graduated high school in a class of 51 where one of those students was my identical twin. I then moved to New York City to pursue a modeling career as a way to pay for college with aspirations to attend law school. No one could help me pay for school. I had divorced parents who had jobs, but we were never rich. School was my responsibility. I thought I wanted to be a real estate attorney, however, halfway through my junior year at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, TX, I was out with friends the Saturday night of Easter Sunday in 2005 when I was 22 years old. We were drunk so I didnÕt drive, but I never considered the consequences of being a passenger with my friend who was 3 times the legal limit. We were headed home after the bar closed for the night not 5 minutes from my apartment. It was a really rainy night, and the truck hydroplaned. The truck spun, and we came to a halt when we slid into a tree directly where I was sitting. My friend was driving his single-cab half ton truck with a bench seat, and I was seated shotgun. There was another friend with us in the middle as well. My body had no where to go so basically my entire right side of my body was fractured, and I suffered a very severe traumatic brain injury along with numerous internal injuries. I emerged from a 39 day coma unable to talk or walk. I spent 10 years in a power wheelchair, and progressed to using a big walker now. IÕm still unable to talk, but I have a good career as a public speaker. Yes, your eyes werenÕt deceiving you. IÕm a non-talking public speaker. I ÒspeakÓ by typing into an iPad app that speaks what I type. My Mom and I both speak about the events that led to my situation and about alcohol awareness. Mainly at high schools, but we have speeches for other ages and various venues, including my faith journey as well. Obviously, the faith speeches arenÕt given in public schools. IÕm not opposed to talking about God in public schools, but we know that a career doing that wouldnÕt last more than a day or two! I was on social security disability for a number of years because I had no way to earn a living. My Mom had to quit her job to care for me. My Mom and I then began speaking after she realized how cognitively intact I still was. My doctors from those days couldnÕt believe that either, after sustaining a traumatic brain injury so severe. I attribute that to God! My Mom and I started a nonprofit to support our speaking that we earn a small salary from in addition to providing scholarships to other traumatic brain injury survivors to attend camps for adult survivors. Consequently, I was earning enough to give up social security disability. We have much bigger plans for the nonprofit, but I wonÕt get into those. I know many people legitimately need their social security disability, and I always will if IÕm unable to continue doing what I do, however, by the grace of God we have managed to stay afloat during this ÒpandemicÓ. We are doing presentations virtually while unable to go into schools. WeÕre hoping a vaccine is found soon, and everyone can resume their normal life. IÕve heard many times about a Ònew normalÓ but living in isolation isnÕt living. I believe we will return to the lives we all are accustomed to. I trust that God will take care of us, but even if itÕs my time to leave this body, I know where IÕm going. Until that time comes, I believe that Donald Trump is going to lead the country to the best outcome for us to live a good life. Through the Obama term, I realized I am certainly a Conservative. While just having Republican attached to a name doesnÕt by default make them good, I know my values are totally opposite from the progressive/liberal set of values. I was a skeptic the last election because I worried Trump could have just been saying what we wanted to hear, but there was no possible way I would vote for Clinton! IÕve seen all the good Trump has done, and IÕm now a true believer!"

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3528594410493775,"i donÕt even know where to begin with this. iÕve been a voting democrat for the past 30 years. and like so many of the other stories i have read here, i believed that the democrat party was the party for the people. as an empath, animal lover and someone who has always carried the weight of the world on her shoulders, justice, peace, loving-kindness and equanimity have always been priority number one for me. but i also believe strongly in personal and societal integrity. need i say more? iÕll paraphrase, but the real unraveling for me was watching the kavanaugh/blasey-ford sham hearings and the trial by public opinion that failed to look forward at how this would harm our nation and legal foundation of due process. i remember pointing this out to friends on the left who thought i was not Ògetting itÓ and that i should Òstand with womenÓ and Òstand up for womenÕs right to chooseÓ and not to worry about how things were actually handled and the peopleÕs lives that the democrats were attempting to destroy in order to win a ""victory"" over trump. i had and have great empathy for both kavanaugh and blasey-ford and thought they were both used and abused in that situation. and then there was tara reid and the left was silent... there have been countless other situations since, but the #metoo hypocrisy and denying that antifa exists or is Ònot actually a fascist group because the name means Ôanti-fascistÕ Ò were major turning points for me. i am a media educator and content creator and i know all too well how important framing and editing are in order to convey a message in a way that creates a desired response. i have taught a great number of students over the years about the kind of power that rests in the hands of the editor and that ultimately, what we do is manipulate emotions and the perception of reality. i use the word manipulate in a neutral way; it is what it is. but when done specifically to create harm or to create division, i believe this is a power that is tremendously toxic and harmful to the well-being of all people. what i have seen over the past few years within the mainstream media which fundamentally supports establishment candidates and politicians while denigrating and smearing those who speak up for truth and justice is truly abominable. and what i have also learned over this time is that the masses and the mob are all too quick to judge based on their emotions, without knowing actual facts. the way tulsi gabbard, a patriot, major in the national guard and woman of great integrity who lives in service to this nation was treated both by the DNC and MSM starting with hillary clintonÕs smear tactic of calling her a Òrussian assetÓ and the systemic erasure of her voice was the last straw for me. how could a party that professes to support women, people of color and democracy bury alive the one remaining woman of color who was still in the race yet excluded from speaking? and so few people even knew she was still in the race until she dropped out after covid hit because the establishment tried to erase her. this also made me start a deep dive, looking at the source of all information whenever possible instead of relying on MSM to interpret the ÒfactsÓ. i now have really thoughtful conversations with friends and family who have been behind trump since 2016 and watch daily press briefings and round tables from the white house as well as tune in to the house and senate hearings whenever i can so that i can see the actual policies and thoughts behind them rather than the smeared interpretation and projection from the left. i am beginning to see that trump, like tulsi, has been treated very unfairly and that so much of what the left is going on about is indeed based on Òfake newsÓ. the rioting in the streets and the failure for our elected leaders to stand up to criminal behavior of all kinds in the name of the BLM protests as countless communities were burned and looted and poor people of color and law enforcement were maimed or killed in the name of Òanti-violenceÓ was just icing on the hypocrisy-cake for me. it seems that whenever i raise these issues with friends on the left i am ignored or gaslit. they are so overwhelmed with TDS that they cannot see right from wrong anymore. it is distressing but i continue to have hope that some will begin, as i did, to listen to the truth... so iÕm here because i no longer recognize the democrat party as a party for the people and i will always stand by and for the american people above political party. we are a troubled and flawed nation in many ways, but i believe this nation is built from a collective-heart that is pure and strong and that we will rise above the chaos and destruction and emerge a better people as a result. i hope and i pray that we will continue to work on healing the divisions by coming together in all areas of our lives and that we will model this on love, forgiveness and (truncated)"

I was always a person that was you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. Then Trump ran for election and I was like maybe he could do some good because he doesn't need investors that can control his office like other politicians. I thought he was loud and obnoxious but he used the media to save himself 25 million dollars in campaign dollars. The media lives to demonize him but they insist on digging up and making controversies out of nothing. The comments he made about women while they were brash and rude, I even asked my husband if that would be something he would say in group of guys. Yes.... it gets said, and who cares what the mans life is outside politics. People want an outside life beyond their jobs right, do you want your job meddle in? Anyways, once COVID happened I started seeing liberal media have a hayday on Trump and they literally pulled a person who cared nothing about voting and was willing to go with the flow to a true Trump supporter who can't wait to show my support on Election day!"

I even volunteered for a day on ObamaÕs campaign the first time I was able to vote when I legally became a Citizen. In 2016 even as a liberal I was fascinated by Trump (at first) but couldnÕt stand the way he treated people and the reporters so I was super torn ON Election Day. A strong liberal I just voted for Hillary thinking it would be awesome to have a woman in power. I heard the rumors and scandals of misuse of the Haiti earthquake relief funds but at that time I chose not to look into it. I hate to say it but I somehow felt the Democrats were naturally the smarter more superior option automatically, like choosing the other side was NOT even an option. Ever! I was dating a guy who was a super Trump fan. I HATED the fact that he seemed to adore Trump. He always had negative stuff to say about Obama and the ClintonÕs and I didnÕt want to hear it. After all I really wasnÕt into politics so I didnÕt understand why he kept bringing politics into the relationship so IÕd let it go in one ear and out the other and after we broke up I put on my dating profiles that I was NOT interested in anyone who was a Trump Fan.....fast forward to today and someone literally called ME a ÒTrumpistÓ!!! This same ÒnowÓ friend of mine forwarded me something about ÒPizzagateÓ recently and this was the start down my rabbit hole. I also saw something in my bossÕs email (which I have access to 24hrs a day) which was a video about the Fall of the Cabal. I was shocked that someone was sending her something about this but now I really had to start questioning everything!! When the Virus first started I was posting often informing my friends and making sure they were safe and had all the information but then the conspiracy theories started coming out and I went down those rabbit holes as well. The plan for a #NWO is evident and I have been sharing like crazy!! Because I like to share info I Soon lost my BFF in my home country as well as the Acapella group I was a part of. I became a target of cyber bullying and They started calling me racist and white privileged and ugly and all sorts. Not only that, other people, friends and people I didnÕt even know started attacking my posts. I was shocked that Democrats/liberals were treating me this was for having NON-Liberal views!! I never treated my republican friends this way and I have MANY! And all of a sudden I became ASHAMED That I was ever a Democrat. Watching liberalÕs thirst for power over these last few months has made me ashamed that I was ever a democrat and grateful and I opened my eyes and ears to the information available and being shared to the truth about what is really going on!! Im glad I Walked Away and I am doing everything In my power to help others #WalkAway too."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3528502803836269,"PLEASE SHARE!!! I am voting for President Trump in November and I hope that many more will #WalkAway from the Democratic Party - the party that walked away from its own people. First and foremost, President Donald J. Trump is a President for all people, but especially American citizens. His ÒBuy American, Hire AmericanÓ executive order puts American workers first and encourages a strong economy and low unemployment rate. Just prior to the virus, the US unemployment rate was the lowest in recorded history, including for women and minorities. Hard work pays off - I am a product of it as are millions of Americans. The stock market took a huge hit in March when the virus hit and professionals said it would take two years for it to recover. Many people rely on a strong stock market as their retirement programs are heavily invested in it. My older coworkers were scared to death because their 401Ks took such a huge hit. But look how weÕve recovered! The Dow is back to where we were in February and the NASDAQ is 600 points higher than February! Liberals tend to say, Òthe stock market is only for the rich,Ó but there is nothing further from the truth. If you plan to retire happily one day, the stock market just may be your ticket. President Trump initiated ÒOpportunity ZonesÓ in 2018 to spur economic development and job creation in distressed communities. These zones provide new investments, and under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. The best place for your hard earned dollars is your own pocket - Trump is a firm believer in lower taxes to encourage local economic growth. I work in healthcare and have seen firsthand the detriment that Obamacare has been to my fellow citizens. Universal healthcare is not the answer. Through the PresidentÕs ÒExecutive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare,Ó the Trump administration gives patients the ability to choose the healthcare that is best for them - to make fully informed decisions based on knowing the price and quality of a good or service in advance. This puts healthcare providers into a place of competition, not monopoly, so quality is forced to increase while cost to patients is forced to decrease. I am an animal lover; I grew up with a dog in the house and I have cared for horses through the majority of my teen years. I canÕt tell you enough how much I appreciate President a Trump signing ÒThe Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) ActÓ. This Act makes animal abuse a federal felony. We are the voice for the lives that have no voice. Along those same lines, I believe protecting the unborn, as they cannot speak for themselves. When I read Joe BidenÕs policy on abortion, I was appalled. Biden says he would codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and restore federal funding to abortions via Planned Parenthood. Did you know that abortion clinics were originally placed strategically in the center of minority communities to reduce minority populations? Seriously, look it up. Trump supports the Hyde Amendment which bans the use of federal funds for abortion except in the horrific cases of rape, incest or in life-threatening circumstances. He is the only President that I can recall that has attended the March for Life. Our President respects the Military and has been actively returning our men and women to our homeland since he first took office in 2016. Prior to his election, I heard people say he would force our country into another war. There is nothing further from the truth. President Trump has been making peace and returning military to their families. He is also holding other countries accountable for the military services we provide to them. If they donÕt pay for our services as they have agreed, our military returns home. On that same note, I am a huge supporter of strong borders. The Democrats will have you believe that only poor, hardworking immigrants are coming across the borders and we need to accept them regardless of their illegal status. What they wonÕt tell you about are the criminals that come into our country with drugs, guns, counterfeit products,etc. The left says nothing about the 800,000 sex trafficked citizens that are kidnapped and taken across the border. The only talking point that Democrats seem to push are the Òcages that separate children from their families.Ó Let me be clear - Obama made those cages and put illegals in them. Beyond that, if our borders are strong and illegals cannot get into our country, the cages will have no use. Simple really. Americans value LEGAL immigrants because they have taken the necessary steps to become Americans. We want to live in SAFETY. President Trump has been accused of being a racist by the radical left. Let me explain to you a couple of reasons why this simply isnÕt true. In TrumpÕs early years, way before he even ran for office, he encouraged equality among all races and supported all (truncated)"

My Òmeasly little one vote wouldnÕt matter anyway.Ó I naively just assumed the elected presidents, would do good for the people. I donÕt honestly think my father has ever voted. We just never cared, because it didnÕt matter anyway, we were poor and we were thankful for simply being Americans. I became very passionate, almost overnight, when the BLM ÒmovementÓ began. I had friends that were behaving incredibly hypocritical and I immediately felt, in my soul, this movement was not what it appeared to be. I began digging. And digging more. IÕll be voting for the first time in my life, at 35 years old, in November, for President Trump. This man is brutalized every single day and could have easily enjoyed his leisurely life, seemingly unbothered. He takes all the blows, yet he still shows up for the American people every single day, regardless the color of our skin. This white manÕs pregnant wife, Gail Sue, was left to die in an alley after being brutally raped and beaten, by six black men. Unfortunately, not long after this event, the white woman would die in a house fire. This white man spent most of his days after that, being a severely broken and a very sad, lonely alcoholic. Approximately 14 years later, a black man walked onto this white mans private property and approached him. The black man said, Òget the fuck out of my way, sheÕs mineÓ as he pointed in the direction of a 12 year old little white girl standing behind the white man. This was the first and ONLY altercation the white man had ever been in with a black man, who was twice his size. The white man ended up in a full out brawl, in the dirt, solely to protect this child and he was beaten black and blue. The police arrived and the black man was escorted off of the white mans property. The white man stayed there, because he had nothing but the little trailer on the lot that he worked SO hard to buy and he had no other options. The little white girl was thrown into the foster care system not too far down the road. The white man became a ward of the state, due to his alcoholism. The white girl went on to graduate high school with nearly all A grades, played sports and got involved in any extra curricular activity imaginable. When the white man became sober, after years and years of alcohol abuse and many visits to a jail cell, the little white girl reunited with the white man. Before, during and after these incidents, the white man never ONE time went and provoked any semblance of violence toward a black or white person out of hate. He never one time told the little white girl she needed to be afraid or racist against the black man. He said, they were just bad people who did bad things to other people. I am that little white girl in the belly of her mother, years later hiding behind her father. The collage photos are the white man today, bone dry sober, 15 years, with his family, including his two black grandchildren (my sisters children) but her story is hers to tell. He has never one time, looked at either one of them, with anything but love. Nobody in this family has ever told either one of them that they need to be fearful in this world because of the color of their skin. They are capable of anything and they have the opportunity to be whoever they wish, regardless of the hate and fear mongering my late mother and father encountered. Hate breeds hate, regardless of the skin color. Only when we choose to break the cycle, and we stop teaching racism, like itÕs our freaking job, will it end. Race baiting and killing innocent people in the streets, will never be the answer. With this being said, I will not align myself with the mush brained protestors (some of whom wouldnÕt know oppression or racism if it sat on their faces) and the antics being used to push our beautiful country in a direction that takes away my ability to choose my own morals and forge my own path.

Even then my vote was swayed by the people in my life and not through any research of my own. I was still blind. Something happened when covid19 came. Everything was closed down and I was told I had to wear a mask everywhere. I couldn't even get into my doctors office or have a surgery I needed. Something didn't seem right. I started doing my own research. I fact checked the fact checkers. I dug in. That's when my eyes were opened to the extreme cultish views of the left. The leftist media bias and constant lies coming from every news source. Then, the riots. More power grabbing and more lies. This country is being torn apart.

I fight for social justice, I make food for the homeless with love notes in the bags. I make Òlove bombsÓ (love notes from the universe) and leave them at the gas station or the grocery store for strangers to find. I take care of my friends and my family. I always thought that the Democratic party was more aligned with me. I was indoctrinated that liberals were Òthe good guysÓ. If you care about others, you are a Democrat and if you care only of yourself, you are a Republican. I have come to realize I was fooled. When I think of a perfect world, I think of a healthy earth, abundant soil, people who play more than they work, people who connect with others and live from their heart. I see a world where people are encouraged to find their passion and are able to make money from those passions. I picture strong communities with creative spirits living together and helping each other to thrive. I see wild animals moving through jungles and forests that are not being destroyed and pillaged for resources. I envision designer brands becoming meaningless because the new brands are luxuriously made with ethics, of natural materials that do no harm. These are the things I want for the earth and its people. I was raised to think and got trapped in thinking that liberal politics were closer to that....they were an okay compromise and ON THE PATH to that. I always felt it was the lesser of two evils. I knew that they take money from all of the corrupt corporationsÉ.but, they still care about peopleÉright? DonÕt they? At least more than the Republicans, right? I never really sat with the knowledge that if they take money from Johnson & Johnson, Monsanto, Pfizer, Google, Walmart, Bank of America THERE IS NO WAY they are working in the best interests of the population. Neither are the Republicans, I know. We need an overhaul of our politics in general. But what I realized this year is that thereÕs no space for FREEDOM under Democratic politics. There is only space for Òlisten to what we said, we know best for all of youÓ, and I am realizing that the only way that our earth will ever get anywhere near the world that I envision, is if the defenders of the earth and the defenders of the water and the defenders of children, are the people that are in power. We will never get there if we donÕt have freedom to question government and question policies. Under the Democrats, I am only allowed to follow their rules. As I have begun questioning, I have seen in every part of my life that thinking differently is punishable by cold shoulders and vitriol- even by my liberal friends and family. Questioning the narrative is reckless and selfish. Critically thinking is ridiculed and shamed. On a wider scale, I have publicly asked questions on the pages of the politicians THAT I VOTED FOR. I am attacked and called a troll, told to go watch Fox News, accused of lying that I am a liberal. So today, I understand that APPARENTLY freedom over my body and whether or not I want vaccines, whether or not I want a mask over my face and whether or not I can go to work have made me a Republican. Wanting to listen to a wide range of doctors and scientists, instead of just the Òapproved onesÓ makes me a Republican. Believing that censorship of divergent voices is wrong makes me a Republican. So, this year I will be voting for any candidate who is in support of vaccine choice and any candidate who does not have ties to big Pharma. The pharmaceutical industry is in charge of all of the doctors and scientists that are spitting in the faces of the population and laughing behind their backs. If we are not free to make choices regarding vaccines, we are done. So my vote and my voice will be 100% behind any politicians that have spoken out against this coronavirus narrative, who have rejected mask orders and who do not support mandatory vaccines. So, I guess I am a Rebublican now. (or more Libertarian, but since we have a rigged two party system I will likely vote Republican) Bye Bye Dems.

IÕve come to the conclusion itÕs been smoke and mirrors, the only thing that liberals care about is ""POWER"" & ""GREED"" anyway they can get it. Nothing ever truly changes when they are in control. I did NOT support Obama & his presidency was a mistake. There was just something about him that did NOT ring true. I realized what a mistake it was for America. He help create the radical left and brought racism back to an all time high. The BLM is exploiting a criminalÕs death for their own agenda, lead by Soros, socialist liberals & the ignorant ultimately making things worse, we had no protests, we had anarchy, we had the BAD people looting, burning their own communities while the liberal politicians did NOTHING TO HELP their communities. BLM is funneling money to Democrats. Every 4 years the Dems become more evil & if the democratic voters don't wake up America & our freedoms as we know them will be gone! I'm tired of working my whole life & doing everything right while the poorly raised & the ignorant stand with their hands out for more & more ""FREE STUFF"". If there are no consequences for the bad or no accountability for the people holding us hostages in our own country we are doomed. I'm tired of the hate, ignorance & the word RACIST! I donÕt agree with everything Trump says & does cuz he's not a politician, one of the reasons I voted for him, but he was definitely the right man for the job as President #walkingaway #trump2020 #saveamerica #stopsocialism"
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3528295117190371,I am with #WalkAway. I always thought that when it came to politics if you voted Democrat it was to support the lower and middle class of society and only wealthy people voted Republican. My father who is a history nut told me that I have to figure out who my viewpoint aligns with more as a party and vote accordingly. I had never voted before and was living in South Carolina at the time when Barack Obama was running for his first term. I was so excited because of how far we have come I. This country with racism. I voted for Barack Obama the first time because I was ill informed. When his second term came up I had done all of my research and found out that the Democratic Party was a party of racism and then I could not understand why Obama identified with that party. (To be honest I am still a little confused about that one). I did not vote for Obama the 2nd time and have never voted Democrat since. ObamaÕs era made me research on my own and opened my eyes to what the true motivation of the Democrats are and then I felt sick that I ever said I identified with them. Now fast forward to today it is amazing to see that President Trump is doing so well in the face of so much adversity. The left have lost the ability to keep their true motives hidden any longer. Even the human trafficking and child molest concerns are not even mentioned on the left. It sickens me to think that so many of our country vote and believe in the ideologies of the Democratic Party. We need to come together not by the color of our skin but the love of our country. I thank you for accepting me into this group because I am starting to be an angry person when all I see and hear is lies and deceit from the left. Our country is the most important thing at the end of the day and we must fight to save it!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3527225647297318,"This is my #WalkAway story, bear with me, it has been a long journey. On my 18th birthday I registered to vote, and registered as a Democrat. I come from a family of inter-generational Democrats. We were Roosevelt and Kennedy Democrats ever since my Irish and German family came to America. I was a social justice warrior before the term had been coined. All my heroes were Leftists, and I thought the Left had a monopoly on virtue. I got involved in social work and anti-gang intervention programs in the inner city; always keen to manifest into action the ideals I espoused. I believed wholeheartedly in the victimhood narratives; society was to blame, and more specifically, the rich Ð which meant Republicans. In my early 20s I converted to Islam, and I took all those sociopolitical concepts with me; it wasnÕt long before I became radicalized. All the typical Leftist indictments against America morphed into religious condemnations. I was never involved in any anti-American groups, but I held extremist views. I moved to the UAE in the early 2000s, and precipitated a confrontation with a German man whose behaviour I deemed immoral, things escalated, and the man tragically died as a result of my actions. I was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death. It took this horrific chain of events, this descent into, really, the madness of radicalization, to finally jar my mind out of the indoctrination. For the next 7 years, I read everything I could get my hands on in prison, not only about politics, history, and economics, but about Islam and the way extremists warp the teachings of the religion. When I was eventually released, after it was established that the manÕs death was not intentional, I moved to Turkey and actively wrote in support of democracy and against violent extremism. My writing focused on nonviolent strategies for the people in Egypt to resist the military coup in that country, because I saw how easily activists could be swayed by jihadi rhetoric and the whole nation could be plunged into a Syria-like civil war. Despite this, I was portrayed in the media as someone who incited violence Ð never mind that I received death threats from ISIS and was condemned by the Muslim Brotherhood. I started to see strong correlations between the extremism among Muslims and radical Leftists. The intolerance, the stridency, the echo chamber quality of discourse, and the destructive Utopian delusions that make the demolition of society as we know it the prerequisite to establishing their Ideal State; extremist Islamists and ÒwokeÓ activists share all of these pathologies. Still, when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, I was crushed. I despised Hillary Clinton, but I loathed Trump even more. Nevertheless, I vowed to remain objective. Over the past 4 years, I have watched the Left nurture a mania against this man that is truly psychotic, while he has implemented policies that are inarguably beneficial to the country. He has shown us all the power of the presidency. He has been decisive, he has been proactive, he has genuinely put America first, and he is the first president in my lifetime who I feel sincerely loves the United States and the American people. After decades of, first, Left-wing propaganda, and then radical Islamism, President Trump has restored my patriotism and hope for my country. As I watch Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the ÒwokeÓ movement terrorize AmericaÕs cities, I know very well where this will lead, and the Liberals simply do not care. As someone who has followed these kinds of ideologies to their terrible conclusions, I can say unequivocally that they hate the United States, and quite literally, our president is the only thing standing in their way. We all have to stand with him."

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3528228053863744,"In the spring of 1977, I was getting ready to graduate high school and I had just turned 18. I had been asked to work at our town polling station which was city hall. While working at the polls that Election Day I registered as a Republican in a town where only 5 people were Republicans. When I came home, I told my parents and grandparents that I had NOT registered as a Democrat. I wish I had a video to show the reaction they had to that decision. I was promptly asked what I had done and why. My reply was simply that I could not in good conscience align myself with the platform of the Democrat party and be a Christian at the same time. Abortion was the deciding factor in becoming a Republican. My family always voted Republican for President, never once for the Democrat but as a Republican in the Florida Panhandle in 1977 there were no candidates for office until the general election. For me it was the time to decide where I stood. I have never regretted that decision but I believe a lot of people just do as their parents have done but we all are individuals and we have a mind of our own, educated or not. I could not then and I cannot now reconcile Christianity with the Democrat Party. For me it was as simple as that."

Reading your stories has filled my heart with joy and continues to validate my belief that America will survive this attack from within. I was raised in a VERY liberal, atheist household. I was taught to believe that Republicans are evil people who only care about money and not about people. Democrats are the tolerant and loving ones who care about the plights of humanity. Ha! I married a conservative man, but we never talked about politics. Ever. I voted for Gore and mocked BushÕs lack of finesse and went along with media criticism. Until 9/11...that event, watching President Bush in his calm demeanor, comforting our nation, sparked something inside me. I started asking my husband questions. What do republicans really believe in? HeÕs a lawyer and answered with facts. I realized in that moment that I align more as a conservative. I made a decision that I would vote for a Bush in his 2nd election. When my father found out, he was furious. He practically disowned me, telling me I represent all that is bad. It got ugly. I was devastated. But I stayed true to my beliefs. We had many years of discourse between us. After trying as forcefully as he could, for nearly 20 years, to convince me I am wrong and persuade me back to the Democratic Party, he has stopped. He realizes that nothing he says will change my views. ItÕs interesting, in all these years, I never tried to CHANGE his views. I just had hoped he would accept mine! I have witnessed the education system beat down on my son for defending Trump and I have spoken up. A young man on this site recounted that Hitler spoke of controlling the minds of the youth, thus controlling the future. ItÕs frightening. I have been a proud Republican for 20 years! I love all people and I donÕt care what your skin looks like. I support anyoneÕs life...period. I want to spread as much love and light and unity as possible. I believe in law enforcement and I believe in mutual respect. I walked away from the media 3 years ago. Best decision I ever made! Sending you all love and light!!! Trump 2020!!!________"

I often wonder if they think we have no idea of what they are doing or just don't care if we know.

I've been voting Democrat all my life (I'm 75) just because my parents did. I know not a good reason. In 2016 I went to see the movie Hillery's America. That movie opened my eyes to what the Democrat party stands for. I know it was just a movie but it contained a lot of history. History that unvailed things about the Democrat party that I never knew. I voted for Obama twice because I thought he would try to heal the divide in this country, inregards to race relations. Not only did he not try he made matters worse. The thought of waking up to Hillery every morning did not appeal to me, so I picked the lesser of 2 evils and voted for Trump. I'll be voting for Trump in 2020 and all other Republicans in order to take back the House and keep the Senate."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3528014003885149,"My story... I was raised by two, very liberal parents that were your classic 1960'/70's youth at the time. I was raised to be free in my thinking, arts, what I wore, how I talked and was hardly punished if I did anything wrong. On the other side of our home lived my grandparents who were God fearing, work hard, obey the rules type of people. I was living with two polar opposites of adults in my home, so I saw a lot of different types of character. Naturally I followed in the footsteps of my parents and thought as a Democrat for years, and I don't know if the word liberal was around back when I was a teenager and in my early twenties but you could also count me as that too. But I came to Christ (totally different story), had children, and I grew up. For awhile I was on state assistance and I saw how abused the system was and is and I was appalled watching people like the caseworkers even allow the system to be abused. I used it when I NEEDED it and got off as soon as I could! I started voting Republican I started thinking conservative about 12 years ago if not longer and telling people how the system is abused. My family didn't believe me! I freaking lived it and that thought I was lying! Then as the years went by I had family members laugh at me, make fun of me and in the long run, I now don't even speak to them along with my own father. In his own words, ""what the hell happened to you, I thought I raised you better than this""... All because I vote for Trump. Well I'm here to tell you, I'll vote for him again in November!"

I was raised in a Democrat family and just kind of thought that made me one too. I never really paid much attention to politics that much although I did vote, but didn't really put much thought or research into it. Then Obama was running for President and for the first time I knew I would not vote for him; nor did I the second time he ran. I was so disappointed he got elected twice but didn't act like the Democrats are now about having Donald Trump as our President. I just accepted it and hoped for the best. When Donald Trump started campaigning for the first time I felt we had someone who was for the people, not a career politician, was not worried about being politically correct, was a good businessman, and loved our country and wanted to best for it. I have never looked back. I admit I told maybe one other person I was voting for him; the stigma was just so bad. Once he really was elected I started to speak out that I voted for him and was no longer ashamed of it. I have been unfriended by family and friends on FB because I am for our President. I still have an older sister in her late 80's who hates our President so bad. We try not to talk about it, but one day she admitted she guessed she was a Democrat because Daddy was; our father passed away in 1984! I told her these Democrats are not what our father would have voted for it is a totally different party now!"

I voted for many DemocratÕs along the way, I even changed my party from Independent to Democrat before Obama. When Trump came into the picture, I was super annoyed with his egotistical personality, and his communication skills leave something to be desired. I voted for Bill Clinton and for Obama, but I damn sure wasnÕt voting for Hillary because she is a slimy girl... secretive, deceitful, cold, calculating, and manipulative. She is the epitomy of everything thatÕs wrong in our government. So, I was in an awful position in 2016.... I hated them both!

Instead of helping them up... they are holding them back. If you give your children everything they could ever want... there is no incentive for them to get up and go get what they need. It cripples them! ItÕs a cycle of entitlement that I did not give my children, and if you know my kids... you can see first hand what drive, ambition, personal responsibility, and accountability really is. Life is about integrity... that is non-negotiable. I, for one, will not be held back. I am not oppressed, and the only privilege I have is being an American, and IÕm proud of it. I owe no one for my life, except the men and women who serve to protect it. The only person that I can thank for getting me where I am today, is myself. ThatÕs what pride is all about.

My other brother was Airforce bulldozer driver and my oldest brother was a medic in 3 wars and he is a Doctor Air Force retired. Still runs a VA clinic. Uncles cousins all fought for the freedoms we have in this beautiful country. IÕm disgusted by the people that spread hate across our country. The sadness I felt has turned bitter. IÕm totally disgusted and cannot even allow myself to get into an argument with such ignorance and hate any longer. They donÕt listen and they find reason to attack you for anything! I am the administrator of a town group and i have about 4000 members. Once the young people started posting about BLM and changing the world from racism my group changed overnight. After a couple of weeks of allowing it ( i try to be fair and balanced) i stopped it and then the conservatives started posting things. So all these people that cannot post anymore BLM and change the world crap complain and find fault and message me etc. accusing me of only allowing what i agree with and being biased. I allow politics on ThursdayÕs only now but the liberals are brutal and hurtful and hateful. I had to actually make an announcement that you have the right to disagree with the President but you will not swear at his name or post hateful memes about him. I delete them one by one because they cannot stop once they start attacking. I have in my rules, If you cannot prove your point while being respectful you will be removed.

Everything that President Trump says or does is attacked only because they lost and they hate him for it! Biden is not fit to feed himself let alone run a country he helped ruin with Obama.

Benghazi was the line for me. I am now an Unaffiliated voter (independent). I have always voted for who I thought was best for the position.

He wants this country and all its people to be successful, free and happy!! He wants law and order to protect us. I support our military and police 125%. I do not support the bad apples, and every organization has them. What I despise is name calling, belittling people, twisted facts, and not allowing people to have opinions. There is so much evil in this world and the evil will do anything to win......... IÕm not a conspiracy theorists but IÕm not blind either. Our country had moved so far and now itÕs being divided by evil using the past. There is always room to improve but living in the past, allowing the past to keep you down, playing the blame game, feeling entitled is only excuses to be nothing and never improve.

All people, all walks of life....no judgement. We together have got to get out and vote, get others to vote. Be a strong voice with compassion, love, empathy and zero hate! No name calling, no violence. Even when we want to explode, letÕs be bigger together. And most of all...pray pray pray!"

Thank you Brandon Straka for having the courage to start this group!! My story: I'm a loud and proud Conservative that's finally come out of the closet! Ha!!______ I was raised a liberal Dem so I followed along voting Democrat in every election believing without question what I was told -- that all Republicans were wealthy people that didn't care about the working poor. Throughout the years I did start questioning my political beliefs and began listening to both sides all the while becoming even more confused not knowing what to believe. I was Hillary supporter and convinced I'd vote for her but then it became personal for me. A drunk driver (repeat felon) ran a red light plowing into my suv nearly killing me and forever changing my life. I was a very active person that walked our rescue dogs 2 hrs. daily and after the wreck standing/walking is excruciatingly painful. 2 mos.hosp stay, multiple pelvic breaks, perm. nerve damage in my leg/foot, etc.. The driver had no ins., no job and had been released from jail the same day he hit me and after hitting me he ran from the scene. The detective working the case said the lib judge had refused to issue a bench warrant but after multiple attempts he finally changed his mind. In Nov. 2016 I voted for Donald Trump and never looked back. I won't support criminal coddlers and that's exactly what Democrats are - dangerous and destructive for you, me and everyone else.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3527112473975302,"Hello everyone! My name is William and I am a 26 year old, gay, Independent. A few short years ago I would have described myself as a liberal. I identify with the,Óoutsider,Ó and the weirdo and I viewed conservatism as a champion for conformity and values I simply didnÕt agree with. One of my greatest aspirations is to be a novelist, I love words and I love their ability to stir feelings and provoke introspection. I wanted to be able to do that for people as it had been done for me countless times since I was a child. While living in California I attended a community college while I worked a full time job and while there I pursued English and writing as my major. I loved the diverse environment that my college provided and most people were open to new ways of looking at things, provided that it fit a specific mold. I noted this through out my time there, but never saw it as an issue because I too was a liberal and if thats what people were feeling then certainly they were on to something, especially since I was in academia. I learned about racism, colonialism, the general unfairness people of color faced and I empathized, as I happen to be a gay man to boot! Sometimes I would be told,Ó This is something you wonÕt understand, your whiteness will stop you from understanding this.Ó When I would hear this I felt distraught, not because I agreed, but because my empathy wasnÕt welcome, nor was my input in an environment where I was convinced all opinions were welcome. Now, iÕll admit here that there are things I wonÕt understand. Some of the pain people feel will be foreign to me and thats ok, as long as IÕm self-aware of my own ignorance then I can work towards a deeper understanding of the human condition. I even shelved these moments as, Òthings I simply do not understand and might some day if I relinquish my privilege,Ó and I was totally on board with deconstructing this bubble I, apparently, lived in. But, one day, when I was in a creative writing class, I was given an assignment to write a short story to be peer reviewed by a small group of students. I was so excited to do this because it was something I loved, something that sustained me and it is something I think about constantly, even now. I racked my brain for something worth writing about, in twenty pages or less. I love history, I love people over coming terrible odds or even trying to survive hopeless situations, these stories inspire me. California was host to Asian internment camps back in the 40Õs and it was jarring to me that once upon a time such a thing existed in the town I lived in (Fresno, CA). So, also being a huge admirer of Akira Kurosawa and Japanese culture as a whole, I decided to try to get into the minds of a small family of immigrants who were being threatened with the camps. They had to make a decision of if they would stay and ride out the treatment by the camps or return to Japan. It was a family of three generations. An elderly patriarch, who was pro-Hirohito, his son who was trying to be seen as American, his wife who was trying to be a dutiful wife/mother and their son who has never seen Japan and only knows America and American life. I wrote non-stop for days, did hours of research, rewrote it several times trying to add those dramatic aspects that I had seen in Kurosawa films and then when it was due I excitedly submitted it to the small panel of students including my Chicano professor. The panel of students absolutely loved it, including the one person on the panel who happened to be half-latino/half-japanese. He told me his grandparents acted some of the ways the patriarch acted in my story and he was convinced that who wrote it was Japanese. I was so happy to get this kind of feed back because it told me that I had done my job as a writer. I was able to create the fantasy and make it believable. However, when it came to my professor he didnÕt note on ANYTHING other than one detail. I wasnÕt Japanese and I wrote about Japanese characters. Nothing about the story flow, nothing about the syntax, not a criticism of any kind about my use of adjectives. Just, simply, I was white and I was writing about something I couldnÕt fathom on the basis of my skin color. My liberal sensibilities told me to let it go and accept the fact that there was simply some things I would not understand. But, my sensibilities as a writer were enraged. Why did it matter if I wasnÕt Japanese, I could clearly understand the fear, uncertainty, and hopelessness of a situation that seemed out of their control. WasnÕt that a part of the human condition, being faced with insurmountable odds and having to make impossible decisions? WasnÕt that something every human had to face at one point in their life, perhaps not in the same macro sense as this family, but as a working class person, working full time to pay for only the first step in a long career as a student? Clearly not and whats more he wanted me to (truncated)"

They did come around when my mother married my father and my uncle was appointed to fill a vacant seat as a representative then later as he was elected senator. I participated in numerous campaigns, was part of the young republicans. When I was growing up and starting to date two things were asked. What is your political affiliation and what is your religion. Political affiliations was before religion. My father had to belong to a union. Just the way the big city I grew up in was. When my parents were invited to President NixonÕs inauguration my father was not given the time off to go. He was not allowed to put a Republican sticker supporting a candidate on his car. Our house was targeted numerous times with vandalizim because our neighbors knew who we were. I was called out in class at school because they knew I was related to a US senator and teachers tried to embarrass me by asking me questions they didnÕt think I could answer.

I watched as parents cried, mothers were arrested (and they didnÕt burn anything down) I listened to a 23 minute passionate plea from Senator Stone who is a Pharmacist, he suggested that the committee listen to the stories, and was denied. I lost every single ounce of respect I held for a party that is supposed to be about freedom of choice, inclusivity, and bodily autonomy. I watched Senator Richard Pan meet with lobbyists behind closed doors. I saw it. I was there. It was that day that I realized just how corrupt and disgusting it all is. It was that day that changed everything for me personally. So people can say Ò IÕve changedÓ you know what? I have. I absolutely have.

Joining the National Guard at 17 years old under the ""delayed entry"" program and still in high school infused 'some' patriotism in me. My big political awakening came later when my boss would play Rush Limbaugh on the radio everyday on the job from noon to 3pm. Rush made learning about politics fun. He is very gifted at ""recognizing the truth"". He also taught me how the broken manner in which the liberal mind operates, including in the mainstream ""lying"" news medias. My sole purpose with my testimonial is to advise my much cherished new conservative-convert brothers and sisters is to ""BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU GET YOUR NEWS FROM"". Fox News on cable is starting to veer in a liberal direction, but you still have Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingram and maybe a couple others that are still worth listening to. Rush Limbaugh is still on the radio daily from Noon EST to 3pm, usually on AM radio. Most of good conservative news comes from conservative news sites on the web: breitbart.com, dailycaller.com There are many others. The only way to counteract all the lies you've believed in the past is to replace it with the truth. Being careful with your source of news can help achieve this. God bless you all!"

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3536390333047516,"Hi everyone. I joined awhile back and have really enjoyed reading all stories. I walked away 19 years ago, but the reason I did is more relevant today than ever. I finally worked up the courage to share my story, so here it goes. I was born and raised in Chicago, lived there until my late 20Õs when I moved to the suburbs. When you live in Chicago, youÕre automatically a Democrat. You donÕt think about it or discuss it É. you just are. ItÕs handed down like a family tradition. My family wasnÕt super political, we didnÕt really discuss politics. We watched the local news, mostly the NBC affiliate Channel 5 in Chicago. Sometimes we watched the network news afterwards, but not often. Fast forward and 9/11 happens. I became a news junkie É I couldnÕt get enough. So, for the first time I watched cable news. Naturally because I grew up watching NBC, I started watching MSNBC. I have a tendency to be a channel surfer, so anytime commercials came on I switched over to CNN. There was a bill the Democrats were bringing up for a vote (for the life of me I canÕt remember what it was.) It was a bill that was a no brainer, everyone should want it passed. The Republicans were against it. For weeks I watched the parade of Democrats on MSNBC and CNN talk about how awful the Republicans were for being against the bill. I bought into the hatred night after night. One night during a commercial on MSNBC, I switched to CNN. They also had a commercial, so I just kept surfing. I stumbled upon Fox. They had a Republican on talking about this particular bill so I left it on. I wanted to hear them explain their awful stance. It turns out the Republicans were FOR the bill. The Democrats had tied it to an ANOTHER bill that was horrendous the Republicans refused to pass it. Not once did I ever hear that on MSNBC or CNN. I am embarrassed to say it was the first time I learned that they tied bills together to force passage. (I know both parties do it, there should only be clean bills allowedÉ 1 thing at a time.) (Just look at the crap that was hidden in the middle of Obama Care). It was then that I realized I had spent my entire adulthood up to that point never hearing the other side of the story. How many things did I get wrong because I believed the liberal media half-truths or outright lies? You think youÕre just watching the news, not liberal or conservative É just the news. But youÕre not. You are literally being indoctrinated. You donÕt know what you donÕt know. If the media was that biased then, now itÕs biased on steroids! 19 years and I have never looked back. These days when I watch Fox, I make sure I donÕt just watch the right leaning opinion shows like Hannity, etc. I make sure I watch shows like Outnumbered or The Five. I purposely watch shows that feature Democrats like Juan William (ugh) or Donna Brazille (double ugh) so I can hear the other side. I consider myself an Independent, although I have found I am more conservative than I would have ever guessed. Let me hear both sides of the story and I will make up my own mind. I like to think that if the Democrats ever found a decent candidate, I would be open minded enough to hear them out. In reality, that will never happen. The Democratic party has moved so far left there is no coming back from it. Moderate Democrats should be taking the red pill in droves! I hope my story can help wake up at least one person and get them to listen to the other side."

The first time I voted was for John Kerry and when he lost I felt broken. Next time around I fell into the ""change we can believe in"" trap. I voted for Obama I felt like I had done the right thing, felt like things were going to get better. Then the reality of the situation kicked my teeth in. I lost a good job because of the economic decline, found another one, that plant went belly up for the same reason. I ended up trying to support a family of 4 on a part time job paying 8.25 an hour doing work not fit for any man, working condition were terrible and one man died doing the same job as me. We tried to get assistance but were told we were to white... Not an exaggeration. So next election I didn't vote. Wasn't worth my time and I thought they both sucked. Ide given up on everything politics, family, life. I was drowning my self in booze hopeing if I died at least my family might get help. I felt betrayed and blamed everyone for my problems. Then one day I see Trump come down an escalator... And I thought who the hell does he think he is? No way he's gonna drop out in a month this has to be for the camera. Then he didn't drop out, and I started listening. And the more I did the more I liked what I saw. And then I seen HER up on stage talking about how great a job she and Obama did and how we needed to stay on that path. My blood began to boil I looked at my wife and kids and how we were living and thought if this is what we have to look forward to then I should just end myself I couldn't keep going on living in poverty and poaching small game to feed my kids while my wife and I started our selves so they would have enough to eat. my vote for Trump was my last stand if he failed it was game over. I was seriously considering suicide. After the vote we went home and ate a rabbits I had shot the day before. I had no TV so I got out an old battery powered radio and tuned in to hear the results. And when all the Democrat hosts started breaking down in tears because it looked hopeless for Hillary that was the first time in 8 years I had felt hope. When he won I cheered so loud the neighbors dog started barking. Now fast forward 3.5 years. We have moved to a new town live in a home I couldn't have ever imagined I could afford and even though the shutdown has effected us I have a good job and we are all well fed with no government assistance. My kids are happy and so is my wife. I thank God every day for sending us Trump he truly saved my life and the lives of my family. It has not been without cost. My vote cost me many of my friends and family. I had and still have to work hard every day but I wouldn't trade any of it for anything. I proudly ware my MAGA hat without shame or fear. Some call me a racist for it, I have had my car vandalized and been spit on but I keep my head high. Trump change the game and I will do my best to see that he stays in the game for 4 MORE YEARS!!! God bless the president and God bless the USA."

Family, the typical democrat of course. In 1996 I began questioning some thing and started paying attention to certain details. IÕve noticed that in my community blacks vote democrat based off fear. I would hear things like Òif so and so donÕt win then the other guy is going to take away our social securityÓ and other nonsense. A young 15 yeah old me asked the simply question which made me a target by my own community and family. I simply asked Òif we vote this person in what will we gain? If you look around we havenÕt been receiving anything. In fact things are only getting worse.Ó The typical answer Òthe white man is taking awayÓ blah blah. I never believe that narrative so 1996 a young 15 year old turned away from the Democratic Party and I became a never democrat. I jokingly today say I am the blueprint to Lady Candace Owens Blexit. I grew up watching lots of Malcolm X speeches and the speech Ballot or the bullet really hits home to where I politically stand. I am neither a democrat or a republican though as stated I became a never democrat some believe that it instantly means IÕm a republican but I am not. 2016 was the first IÕve ever voted. Some would ask why havenÕt I voted before then and the answer is simple. I like to vote for those I feel are true to their word, one that doesnÕt feel like they are just saying things for votes. IÕve also became outcasted by family and my community losing my Òblack cardÓ when I didnÕt vote for Obama. Lots of blacks people voted for him because he was black and not his policies, if there were any. The blessings being born in New York in the ghetto is that you are always around con artist and swindlers so you become pretty able to point out who is who and Obama was a dividing con artist. So, 2016 was my first time voting and I went with trump. Not because I though he was this great and awesome hero that some people see him as but the fact that he was different and he doesnÕt sugar coat things. When he talks I completely understands where heÕs going, what heÕs trying to explain and so on. I know he isnÕt perfect but he was better than Clinton. Kind of wish he lays long on Twitter but other than that heÕs not the super racist monster the media says he is. Any who I was invited here because I was recently banned from a group for expressing a difference of an opinion. As a black man IÕm not on board with BLM and the narrative they push and I stated that whole debunking some of the lies they push. Because I made my statement while taking heavy assaults from members on that group whose claiming I am not black_ because how I talk and what not. The group administrators slapped a hate speech on my and banned me. Having difference of opinion is hate speech is interesting to know. I donÕt hide or filter out my opinion because you may not like it. I will state my opinion and leave it be. I donÕt care about this cancel culture or being hated on or being banned on social media. I wonÕt be silenced by anyone and never will. The whole thing on debating is expressing ideals and opinions to one another and not to bend the knee to an overlord. Welp IÕve said a lot. Again thanks for the add and IÕll be here often."

I became orphaned at the age of 14 and I was not placed in the system I just drifted for lack of a better term. I graduated at the age of 22 which honestly hurts because I am 4 years behind my peers but it is what it is after being out of school for a literal decade I went back and got my high school diploma and I will be attending college in the winter to become a teacher. These things (not me going to school and succeeding) are because of the running of the democratic party in intercitys and our school systems its abhorrent what the dems have done and are doing to this country and something needs to change I voted for trump 4 years ago and I will again! And if you have read this far thank you for caring

We believed that Democrats supported Immigrants, that they were the party that protected minorities. Trump running for President was a joke to everyone around me, I on the other hand was curious. The truth is that during ObamaÕs last years the direction this country was taking reminded me of my Communist birth country. Like Obama our government promised free healthcare, equality for everyone..but it came at a cost to those who worked hard to make a better life. My father lost his house, his bank accounts, and his car, one day they showed up and took our whole life away. We found ourselves like the people in Venezuela making long lines to try and get some food. I did not want America to become like that. Trump was being blunt and honest. He was not afraid to say the things that many of us were feeling. I decided to come out to my family on a Facebook post. The outcome was to be expected. I lost family members, they thought I was a traitor. My poor mother found herself fighting her sisters to protect me. I explained to everyone that my loyalty was not to party but to America and what was best for the country. Fast forward to today, I have managed to turn most of my family Republican!! Everyone that I love will be voting for Trump in 2020, now it was not easy but I was relentless Lol President Trump has made us proud to be American Citizens, he is the reason we are finally free from the lies that Democrats sold us!!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3536279243058625,"I've never been interested in politics until Trump ran in 2016. I'm a registered democrat but could not vote for Hilary Clinton. I live in a blue state so I knew my vote for Trump didn't matter, but after a quick prayer asking to choose the better candidate, I voted for Trump. I actually cried when I left the voting booth. It really wasn't until the Kavanaugh fiasco & Christine Blaze Ford surfaced from the underground had I paid more attention to the behavior and actions of the democratic party. The behavior from the left at this time was appalling: yelling at members of congress in restaurants, standing outside their homes in groups in the middle of the night, cornering congressmen in the elevators and breaking into an office to steal private information including addresses of those in the republican committees were just a few examples. I had seen enough to know exactly what was going on. Sooner or later, common sense kicks in & you realize you are being played by the democrats. Even the #Metoo movement was in full force, never to be seen with Joe Biden's latest allegation. Hypocrisy in full force. Then there was the whole Russia collusion, Ukraine Collusion and the Impeachment process. I followed all of it! Me! The democrats have worked tirelessly to divide this great county and have been willing to pull out all the tricks to persuade people that our president is evil. Honestly, Donald Trump has his weaknesses and faults but what I have witnessed with my own eyes coming from the democrats is far more evil than the actions of Trump & his administration. I've watched CNN & MSNBC news and have felt only anxiousness and depression from those media outlets then turned to FOX news and felt more uplifting, more hopeful, more energetic. More informed. I now view the news through a whole new lens. I can honestly see why people hate our president after watching CNN and MSNBC. They treat him like he is SATAN. I myself have heard with my own ears how the left had twisted Trump's words on their outlets. ""Wait, he didn't say it that way!"" I've followed the Trump administration's accomplishments, policies and other changes made and honestly, my policies and morals align more with the republican side. I don't even recognize the left any longer. The chaos on the streets and lawlessness in some of these democratic run cities is enough to turn your stomach. How can anyone approve of this behavior? It's blatantly obvious that the democrats don't even want to acknowledge it. How can anyone vote for defunding the police? How can anyone not make the safety of this country and the citizens living in it a priority? Didn't these members of congress take an oath to keep their citizens safe? I voted for Trump in 2016 but I really walked away in 2018. If it were not for Trump, I would still have my head in the sand & remain clueless about the corruption that lies within the democratic party. I will continue to vote Republican no matter if my vote makes a difference or not. Praying for peace, our country, and our republican party."

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3526431994043350,"True story.. I remember back in '03 when I was still in elementary school at Fort Riley Elementary in Fort Riley KS.. asking my teacher who the man in the picture was that was hung in front of our classroom above the classroom clock. It was George w Bush and my teacher told me that the #Republican party were evil and not for me.. She said, I should always vote #Democrat since we're not rich and voting Rebpulican only helps the rich. I've always been a democrat with no solid reason since then and cheered when Barack Obama became our president. I had no solid reason nor did I know anything about politics but yet I chose to be a Democrat. I believe this happened because I was told what to believe and who to side with from adolescence. Fast forward to now, where I'm 27 and doing well for myself.. I will never vote blue ever again.. Nobody is perfect but I believe Donald Trump is the best president we've had in a while. You can nit pick about all the things this man has done wrong sure... but before you put him in a pedestal of judgement, put Obama in the same pedastal. I'm always going to stand up for what's right and this whole #trumpsyndrome that the Democrats have for Donald Trump is childish and wrong. The William barr hearing was a total joke.. The man never got to answer their close ended question! ""Will you continue to beat your wife? Yes or No?"" ""Well, I never.."" ""I""M RECLAIMING MY TIME, ANSWER YES OR NO"" Go Mr. President Donald Trump . I support you as an Asian American immogrant! You are a real warrior going through what you are going through and still persistently fighting the ""mob"". #MAGA2020 I really don't want to argue on here on comments. If you feel like I said anything to the point where you can't be friends with me, then go ahead and delete me. I've been ok with left leaning people posting political posts and if I can't do the same without you getting angry and heated, then I'm ok with us not being friends."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3526386130714603,"I have been in this group for a couple months. I am a #WalkAway. I joined this group because that's just what I did. Some time in the past couple months I realised just how hateful the democratic party really is-the things they condon will ruin this country. I grew up with republican parents. My dad had a strict work ethic he instilled in his children. He also believed the man works hard to provide for his family. So when I ended up in a very abusive relationship he told me to stay in it because my husband loved worked really hard and took care of me, but in reality he spent all his money on drugs. This attitude caused me to believe that the Republican party was evil-consumed with money and not caring for the little guy. Without the help of my family, it took awhile to get out of that abusive relationship and when I did I ended up in the welfare system and in low income housing. I had 3 children and no work experience or childcare. The money from welfare was not enough to take care of my family. Often times we went hungry. Many times the electricity would be shut off for nonpayment. My son only had 2 pairs of pants and if his shoes fell apart in the middle of the month, they got duct taped. I always voted Democrat thinking they were the ones who would change all that, while the Republicans would take away what little I had . Eventually I got tired of the situation. It was no way to raise a family. I still couldn't secure a job so I went to college and got a degree in liberal arts. With that degree, I secured a well paying job working for the welfare office! But again, I was in a job that was dependent on democratic ideas. So I spent the next 15 years voting democrat. It wasn't until the government shut down that I started opening my eyes to what democrats were really about. All the crazy things they do for power. The rioting put me over the top. No longer can I support a party that condones such behavior. I recognise the work ethic my republican father had instilled in me and in that hard work is the road to success. I don't care that my job depends on democratic ideas anymore. If they want to tear down the welfare system, so be it. I can not condone the actions of the Democratic party, they all need to be taken out of office and make way for a new system of government. I walk away. Due to my job being so democratticaly inclined, I can not be out spoken in my views. Nor with my bi-racial family who support BLM. I am the silent magority. Come November, hear me roar!"
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3526365200716696,"I think this page leans more towards walking away from democrat. Though I have some democrat tendencies, up until 2016 I had always been a registered Independent. Was really not one for politics. I voted independent for the very reason to tell politicians they couldn't sway me and or involve me. And I had always been very neutral about things -- maybe moderately hanging right or moderately hanging left on somethings. And no president personally affected me until Obama. For years and years I scrambled to make 17-19k a year. I could be comfortable, but it was literally check to check. But I was okay with it. Then the individual mandate came. Now, during holiday times, a lot of my work shut down for 3 weeks and I would recoup losses with my measly 500-600 return. Of course making what I did, health insurance was out of the question. So one year I got like 200 back and it put me in a world of hell. I lost 32lbs from from lack of money for food and necessities. My tax preparer explained that there was a new fine on your tax return for not being able to afford health insurance. I was like, that's ass backwards. Why? Who did that? And then... Down the rabbit hole I went. Obama. Only president to attack my actual well being and survival. I was so against this that I said, okay, you have my attention and now you have a vote against you. This force into politics has changed me Republican until there is substantial proof Democrats go moderate again. And then I may be back to Independent. Not sure if this story counts, but I did change parties for the betterment of Americans."

I've always been conservative; most Muslims are by nature. However, most Muslims in the USA have been herded into the liberal camp, largely because they felt betrayed after voting for the NWO Bush family. The Democrats only pretend to embrace the Muslim community. But Obama actually dropped way more bombs on Muslim women and children than either Bush did. And the liberals don't actually respect our traditional gender roles, modesty, or family values; they merely want our votes and obedience. Snakes like Ilhan Omar claim to represent the Muslim community, but they are total imposters. Ilhan isn't qualified to represent Muslims, or the American people. I'm sure many of you reading this don't have good feelings about Muslims, or Islam. But I understand your feelings and concerns. There is, for lack of better words, a satanic cult of hypocrites masquerading as Muslims. But I assure you that they also masquerade as Christians and Jews too. Many of you Christians may be surprised to learn that Muslims actually do believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, and we believe he will return to this world in the flesh. You're all welcome to probe me with all the tough questions about Islam that you can possibly think of. I feel much more at ease in the presence of conservative and Christian America, than I do in the presence of godless liberal America. I love America, I love the God of Abraham and Jesus Christ, and pray for President Trump to be divinely guided."

It was about 7 years into George Bushs term that I feel I ""woke up"". I had just moved to a new state, had newborn twin boys. I hardly knew anyone and stayed home a lot. I started watching the Glenn Beck show on Fox.

As my mother would say I wasnÕt so much voting FOR a candidate as I was voting AGAINST the other. In 2016 it was pretty much the same story. I wasnÕt real excited to vote for Trump. After all he is and always has been a pretty polarizing character. However in this past four years he has accomplished so very incredible changes, often without the support of many, if not in some cases most, of the members of his own party! I truly believe he has this nations best interests at heart. IÕll have no problem walking into the polling place, showing my ID, and voting for him this time! I very much believe this may be the most important election of my lifetime.

I have been hesitant to tell my story fearing I could not find the right words. I grew up in a Democrat family. My mom is still a strong liberal Democrat. My dad was a US Steel Worker and went on strike in the 80Õs. They ended up closing the Texas Steel Mill and he lost his job and retirement. He blamed Reagan and I believed him. I voted Straight Ticket Democrat from age 18 -41. I talked to people in my worldly travels and learned that our country was moving in the wrong direction. Hearing an Aunt I visited while in Germany talk about her childhood under Hitler woke me up. She told me that they did not have the freedom of speech in their own homes among their family members in private. They feared Hitler would learn what they talked about. They lived in fear. I choose not to elect anyone who will support that mentality. I voted against Obama and now vote straight ticket Republican. I should have never trusted the Democratic Party. I have walked away from the Democrat party!!!! ____________

I voted straight Democrat from that time forward believing they were the party that cared about the people. Even though I voted for Obama, my mind began to change after the Ferguson shooting and President Obama used that as a way to completely divide the nation instead of showing support for unity. One day I stumbled across the Ben Shapiro Show podcast and I started doing my homework. It's evident that Democrats run the big cities and they are failing miserably with homelessness, high crime, terrible schools, high taxes and expensive housing and they would like to do this for the whole country. I registered as an Independent in 2016. I didn't vote for Hillary because of her corruption. Not sure about Trump yet, I didn't vote for him either. Since he has been President it is evident that he really cares about America's success and that means we all succeed. It is disgusting the way the Democrats are trying to destroy our country for no other reason than pure Trump hatred. For that reason alone I will vote Trump 2020. I will not support a party that thinks rioting, looting, burning down businesses, injuring and killing people is ok."

Being in a predominantly Democratic environment was normal, and had not realized that I had sided with the Republican principals since I was a teenager. In the late 80s I was shunned and scolded by my very Democratic Aunt, when I had mentioned that I really enjoyed listening to Rush Limbaugh's late night talk show. It was quite hurtful the way she presented her very ugly opinion. In my juvanile ignorance I really did not understand her hatred for the man. My relationship with her was forever soured. 1992 I didn't vote, but I was routing for Clinton. 2000 I voted for Gore. There was just something evil about Bush that didn't sit right with me...to my surprise, my wierd intuition was proven correct in 2014. I didnt vote again until 2016. Fast forward 2014, still holding a Democrat affiliation; stumbled upon some video documentaries on youtube while killing my boredom, stationed in Germany. The wrecking havoc of emotional torment that raced through my body was worse than what a person feels when they find out thier spouse has cheated. I was floored, pissed off and devastated. I chose at that point, I was no longer going to push for promotion or retirement from the military. I did my time honorably and was released 2015. I returned home to my confused Democratic mother, and very Conservative step father, to re-establish my new civilian life. When Trump announced his running, I was whooting and hollering like a touchdown was made, I didnt care what party he was running under. I'll never forget the look on my moms face, (a little shocked, but inquisitive) and the toothy smile on my step dads face when I answered her tactful question... ""Really? You think he has what it takes?"" My response: ""He's perfect! He can't be bought."" ...fast forward 2018, my very liberal sister snarked a question: ""Since when did mom turn into a Trump loving conservative?""...my response: ""When she became out numbered."" ...Our relationship has never been the same...blood may be thicker than water; but I'm not a hungry vampire."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3526038474082702,"Cheers Brandon!!! Since joining this wonderful family of concerned and patriotic Americans I've enjoyed hundreds of testimonials on the various symptoms of the DEM-20 virus. This won't measure up to their spectacular stories. I grew up in the era of 'Leave It To Beaver' and moved yearly to new states. I attended 17 different schools before I failed to graduate from high school. My mother was a proud server back when it was called ""waitress"" and worked at the most prestigious restaurants. She was a hard-working prosperous democrat, with an 8th grade education fearless and compassionate. While married, she raised three respectful and intelligent young boys pretty much alone. [Well, two out of three ain't bad!] When we moved to Anniston, AL I was stunned to see Democrat racism up close and personal. I'd heard the N-word (rarely) before, but to my shock, in mid-60's Alabama, it was a frequent pronoun. Fortunately, we left that in the rear view of our worn '58 Olds Vista Cruiser. I don't know if my step-father had a political affiliation. He was always just lurking in the background poised like a hungry dingo. But, I prospered under my Democrat mom and grew into a faithful follower of Brother John Kennedy. Thanks to the GI bill, I finally graduated from high school when I was a senior in college. I was SO very lucky to be able to do that as it changed my life forever. I reject anyone's thanks for my service because I'm forever indebted to my country and the U.S. Army; a debt I will never be able to fully repay. College also allowed me to escape at least part of the circus that was the Carter administration. As a husband, a father, and an entrepreneur) I continued to spread the liberal virus faithfully. My dogs were democrats. My talking African Gray Parrot, named ""Smokey"" even had a few choice words for those who dared use the word ""Republican"" within earshot. By the end of the Carter administration my 17-5/8% mortgage, both double-digit unemployment and inflation had me somewhat disenchanted with the Democrats and the Iran hostage fiasco. The 5-year delay between HS and college gifted me with a more global vision. I saw the hideous hand of two communist countries at war with their own people. Vietnam and Korea were radically different countries and cultures, but they shared a common enemy. One prevailed with our help and the other failed when our political resolve dissipated. I watched in sorrow at the disparity that soon emerged between the two Asian countries. So I bit my tongue and crossed my fingers when Ray-Gun Ronnie was elected. (It's hard to shake a stage-4 Democrat virus.) I'm ashamed to say I never voted for the man that would (arguably) become the greatest president in my lifetime (45 has a real shot). Listening to the news for the next 8 years was hard on my beloved bird, Smokey. Sometimes I wonder if that's why he flew out the door one day and never returned. I was able to get back on the Democrat mule with Clinton. That silver-tongue and charisma was a thing of beauty in the early years. After his second inaugural speech I opened a bottle of wine and sat down with a smile. My wife sat down beside me, and asked, ""What did he say?"" I Formulated my thoughts as I poured her a glass... and said, ""He talked about... you know, big things, making a real difference, our rich texture, and thriving economies, and... and... You know what? He said bupkis!"" The next morning I read his speech in the NYT. I was right. Absent charisma, it was a hollow fog-horn in the distance. I had placed my precious vote directly into the shredder. Suddenly casting about, un-moored, I felt like Tom Hanks frantically searching for the soccer ball he called, 'Wilson'. The Kennedy Democrats were long gone. Reagan had actually brought down the Berlin wall by punking the Ruskies with that ""Star Wars"" rope-a-dope, and I got a new mortgage at 6.25%. But... but... the GOP were rich people not my people! Right? It was hard to argue with my paycheck. I'll avoid going off in or on the Bushes, except to say, I watched live 9/11 in absolute horror. Apparently even W has forgotten that infamous day. I will NEVER forget it. I will also never forget the assassinations of both Kennedys and MLK, and the day in April, 1974 when the last Americans left Vietnam, airlifted in panic mode, while leaving hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to be murdered by their own government... those days are etched in my brain like tombstones on Boothill. Fast forward to 2008. FINALLY! A Democrat I can get behind. His inexperience was lacking, but Obama exuded the Clinton charm (that should have set off the klaxons). Within 90 days of his inaugural speech (dubiously Clinton-ish), I knew I had made a horrible mistake. He was denigrating MY country all over the world! He was airing not only our dirty laundry in foreign countries, but right at home in 'the People's House'! Damn! Another precious vote shredded. ""Wilson? WILSON!!!"" Where the hell is Wilson (truncated)"

I am 25 years old, Christian, always been brainwashed and taught by television and my peers that the Democrats are really for us as African-Americans and brainwashed to believe that only racists or the rich joined the Republican party. I strongly opposed Trump because growing up in my inner city, everyone admired Obama and said Trump hates our kind. Even though I never got deep into politics, but rather went with the wave of what others and the media had to say about Trump (thats why researching on your own is important). I didnÕt get my wake up call until God gave me a vision as a Christian woman of Donald Trump. I believe God had enough of me opposing Trump because he is using him mightily. In my vision, I was surrounded by popular Democrat leaders and the presence felt evil and malicious. Donald Trump came into the room and protected me from them by giving me a hug. After receiving that vision from Jesus, thats when God spoke and said he is using him mightily. This vision happened a while back during the coronavirus hype. So it definitely was the perfect timing to receive it. If I had gotten this vision before COVID, I wouldÕve shrugged it off and continued to listen to the leftist media. I knew something was up when I saw how Trump was going hard against Bill Gates/Dr. Fauci, how they was blaming him for everything, how Trump was saving our meat plants from being shut down, cut off the World Health Organization, and was promoting a medicine that was proven to be effective by medical doctors and peoples testimonies. He was doing things I agreed with and then I saw how he was never called a racist until he ran. After God gave me the vision, I started to proudly declare my support for him on Facebook by posting a photo of me wearing a MAGA hat for the first time. I received the most evil hate mail and stalking ever. I had individuals stalking me on my messages for days saying I was a coon or a Uncle Tom, think that I am white and it was really bad I was considering of contacting the police cause one girl was stalking me on here sending me evil messages. Honestly joining the Republican party was the best decision, they are wayyy more welcoming then the Libs! Honestly, I have experienced more from my own then from others, me coming out as a Trump supporter proved it. EDIT: wow! I have received 25K likes now! Thank you so much to your love and positivity!

I apologize ahead of time if I go off the rails in different directions, but I am so angry with the democrats, the people who refuse to look at any viewpoint other than their own, which hasn't been researched, and the MSM that my thoughts are just all over the place. Im a registered democrat only because I truly didn't know the difference at the time of registration. I'm older and, believe it or not, there was a time in history where the party lines were not as clearly drawn as they are now. I've always voted based on the candidate I felt was best regardless of afffiliation. Then along came the internet and the evolvement of actual news reporting that told the other side of the story. The side the corrupt politicians and media outlets didn't want us to know about or be able to prove. The more I dig, the sicker I get seeing just how corrupt some of these people are. I voted for Trump in 2016 and will definitely vote for him again. The more I read, watch and research, the more convinced I become that he is the only one who cares about the citizens of this country. I'm not sure who I get angrier with, the democrats or the biased media. I was watching a news report on CBS a couple days ago and they were talking about how Twitter partially suspended Donald Trump, Jr's account because he shared that video of the Frontline doctors talking about HCQ. The reporter said his account had been suspended ""for sharing a video that contained information about HCQ being helpful in treating covid. Which is false information and against Twitter's rules"" (not verbatim but close). I wanted to jump thru the tv. She unequivocally stated it was false information. Not that Twitter was saying it was false. I couldn't believe they let a reporter say that. I think of how many people I know who would never check that statement. They'd just take it as fact. She's not a doctor, but because she's on the evening news, it has to be true right? It's the sneaky little things like this that get me boiling. My mom is almost 80 and she doesn't know how to fact check things so she believes everything the MSM says. I am constantly having to explain things to her. Another example is a commercial that says Senator Tillis is all for restaurant employees not washing their hands. Yes he did say that but it was taken out of context from a conversation in 2010 about government regulations. He said ""as long as the restaurant posted a sign saying they didn't require their employees to wash their hands and the problem would take care of itself real soon"". But how many people out there are like my mom or others that aren't computer savvy and can't or won't look up the facts? It's so infuriating."

I am from the beautiful, but very blue, state of Washington; born and raised. Grew up in a small town. My folks were Republican, but when I registered to vote I registered as an Independent. I voted for President Trump in 2016 because I didn't trust Hillary - so glad I did. Jump forward to 2017. My son was active duty Army, severely injured in Afghanistan. I had concerns about the medical care he was getting post injury and worried for his safety (as many of you know suicide is a big issue for our soldiers and veterans who suffer from PTSD and TBI's). I wasn't sure what to do to help him, but knew I couldn't just sit back and watch him implode and do nothing..... I couldn't live with myself if he would have injured himself. So..... I started sending emails. It was a Sunday afternoon. I sent out almost 30 emails that day to Washington state senators, representatives among others; one of which was to our dear President Trump. I texted my son to ask him a question on Monday morning and he told me there was ""a lot"" going on and he would call me back. I ask if I had created a tidal wave and he said - ""no Mom, you created a Tsunami"". None of the Washington state senators or representatives EVER reached out to me; but President Trump did. He CARED about my battle wounded son and rattled cages to get him the care he desperately needed and deserved. I truly believe that he saved my son's life from suicide and I will be eternally grateful to our President for what he did. I have never been very political, like many of you, until all this chaos started. I told my husband, the Democrats are willing to take our amazing county down by starting a race war, just to defeat President Trump!!! This is crazy.... My roots go deep in the United States of America. My family came over on the Mayflower and Abraham Lincoln is my 2nd cousin, 5 times removed.

I didn't really know if my parents were democrats or republicans. When I was in high school I took an International Relations course right smack dab in the middle of Operation Desert Storm. I became obsessed with the news and absorbing everything about the conflict. I watched President Bush act with such wisdom and patriotism that I was so proud of him. The first presidential election I was able to vote in was Bush vs. Clinton. I committed myself to be educated about both platforms and listen to all of the interviews and debates. When my dad asked why I was going to vote for President Bush I told him because it just felt like everything that was coming out of Clinton's mouth was a lie (boy was I way ahead of the curve on that LOL). With that I campaigned hard for President Bush's reelection and immersed myself in politics. Of course he lost but I will never forget how patriotic his presidency made me feel. Fast forward to 9/11 and the next President Bush and again I was so amazed at how he handled the terror and made me so proud. When Obama became President all of that was gone. I felt bad for being an American, like we were apologizing for who we were and that I should be ashamed of who I am. Trump changed all of that again. He believed Americans were great and we always had been. I remember watch the results come in and my husband saying ""he's really done it, he's really going to win"". Unfortunately this has caused so much unrest in my family and I have realized my family is all liberal. They have all drank the Kool aid and buy everything the liberals tell them. They think I'm crazy for supporting Trump and that makes me sad. I'm so glad to have my husband who feels the same way I do. I'm also so lucky to have found this group.

Growing up I watched as my neighborhood went from neighborly and family like to crack houses and broken homes. I am the oldest of 8 children, my mother worked until I was about 10 and she left my stepdad because he was physically abusive to me. We lived on Welfare after that for as long as I can remember. We were so poor and we struggled. My mother didn't drive, was in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. Alcohol and Drugs played significant roles as well as mental health issues. You see she came from an abusive home as well. However she always supported Democratic Leaders as did I. I always said vote for the lesser of 2 evils. Welfare paid the rent and kept the lights on and some kind of food on the table. I moved to VA in 1996 and lived there until 2009. Now I am back in NYS. Up until 2012 I paid attention to politics but not so close. Obamacare hit my family so hard and that's when I really started to pay attention. Then Trump took office and it totally changed my way of thinking in his first year. My family began to benefit and keep a little more of our earnings. We were able to finally buy a home of our own this past November and a new car finally in February. He may seem off script, but I feel like he knows something other Political Figures do not, or he truly just does care about America and the American Families. Forgive me for being political but I am never going to vote for a Democrat ever again. I will now be Libertarian or the closest Candidate to it."

I was born into a Democrat family and grew up in Silver Spring MD in a Jewish community. I walked away about 6 months after 9/11 and I did so because I found the truth, that the man I voted for twice and thought was the greatest President ever and who I cried for the day he left office on Jan 20th 2001 had lied to me and every American about the terrorism that was occurring during his term and that led up to the 9/11 attacks on the USA. The day that I changed my voter registration from Democrat to Republican I became physically emotional, I was upset as if I was leaving my Family, the Dem Party, I realized that I was emotionally attached to that ideology and that I would NEVER EVER let my emotions take over my logic.

I was only 21, and didn't pay much attention to politics. Most of my friends were liberal, and the music station I listened to had a very liberal vibe. The slogan was ""just want a change"". My parents always voted Republican even though my dad was always registered as Democrat. Then I became pregnant with my daughter. Her father left. I dove into the pro-life movement. Before pregnancy I was on the fence, and knew I would never choose to abort, but at the time, thought maybe someone else shouldn't be restricted. Being pro-life, it was easy to be a one issue voter. I couldn't trust anyone who was pro-choice because it was clear to me they didn't care about women, young girls, or about innocent life. They especially didn't care for the forgotten fathers who wanted their children. I found everything I learned about being conservative just made sense. Baby Bush was my hero. But his never-trumpness has totally disappointed me. I knew if Trump decided to run, that he would win. I had no doubt. He's my hero now. It's frustrating to hear that people aren't sure because of things Trump says or tweets, or that he even tweets at all. With this election, it's not about choosing between apples and oranges. It's about saving our country. God Bless the USA.____"

After all we make our own choices and decisions in life whether good or bad. Either we learn from our mistakes and/or repeat them. I will not repeat my mistakes. I am Puerto Rican and was born and raised in NYC. Life in the hood was nothing to glorify, so we left that area when I turned 18. We bounced around to different parts of NY before I met an amazing woman, got married and moved to Florida. It was there where I was awaken and got to understand what freedom was. All my life, like my family members, I was a Democrat. That was until I realized that they did nothing for my people other than pander for votes with false promises. Today I am a conservative, I get shunned, slandered, attacked and eyes rolls from those I once knew in N.Y. Sadly these are individuals who are still slaves to the Government plantation, and are still shackled to the Democratic propaganda machine . Needless t say I ended many friendships with people who were never really friends. Yes, I support Trump, I support this country, our constitution, our Bill of rights, our Law Enforcement and most important we the people.

I grew up in a staunchly Catholic, Conservative, and Patriotic home. I was taught to love God, my Country, and my family. I was taught to love every human life seeing them as the very image and likeness of God and to treat everyone with respect. Growing up in Massachusetts I have a deep pride and understanding of our CounttyÕs founding and the American Revolution. Hard not to when you can visit Paul RevereÕs House and the Old North Church..... I canÕt say we were ever really political though. I am and have been an independent but I recognize our choices are between the two major parties. I was taught the gravity and importance of voting in High School. I have always reviewed the parties platforms carefully to determine who to vote for (not blind party allegiance) and compare that to the Catholic Non-Negotiables of voting (if you arenÕt aware you may want to look them up). Even years ago I could never vote for a Democrat because their party platform usually is incompatible with respect to the dignity of human life and true social justice. So because of that I have always voted Republican. I fully admit that I voted for Donald Trump reluctantly because of his brash personality but it was clear to me that I could never vote for HillaryÕs platform that clearly had no respect for human dignity. Fast forward to the most recent 6 months which has shown us that true avowed Marxists and Socialists are alive in our country and getting very close to destroying it. I never would have thought we would be in this predicament. This group and these stories have given me so much hope. God bless America and God bless our Country."

I studied political science at Wright state University for about two years, and am a local Realtor for my area. I was a big supporter of the Democratic Party ever since I was 8 years old. I believed that the D party was for me. And I voted for Obama twice and was very distraught when Trump was elected in 2016. After the last few years of his presidency and his support for the LGBT and freedom for Trans people in his interviews. It made me curious, right when the BLM movement happened and saying that one life had more value than mine and should be more equal, I started moving more right. After they booted buttiegieg, I was not happy. The Democratic Party sticks to old blood, and never shifts away. It is for that very reason I took on conservative values while still being a productive LGBT person in the country. Covid crisis handling has also shifted my views to the right as well.

Back then however the party was much different. Since then the last good man in the party I'd have to say was Paul Wellstone. I took on the city of Minneapolis in an unjustice after I had purchased 2 houses just before the LA riots/ Rodney King. I was fixing the one house, a big duplex up into a single family home. I was a few weeks from moving in and one night the gangs broke in and stole all the bathtubs, toilets in the house. I reported it the next day when I went to work on it. So it was reported. A week later gangs broke in again, the police arrived and got them out. Well I find out policy there was housing inspector joined in as well. Because the home had no utilities (toilets, bathtubs), they condemned it. What a mess. The city offered me 1$ lol. I fought MCDA and the city on it. No luck. I then called mayor Frazier. No luck. I then sent a certified letter to every Senator & Representative in the state. I then got a call from Frazier who was upset now, but he still did nothing. Anyways, the only person who helped was Paul Wellstone. He wasn't even in the district I was in. He personally called me on the phone. He got me in touch with a very well-known former Supreme Court Judge, now attorney named Miles Lord. Miles took my case for free and we took on the city and MCDA and I got the full amount that I paid for the home back. After that later Wellstone died in plane crash. But was it? I donno, but seeing how he upset many. I can see it now. Over the years I've seen a shift in Democrats, The Clinton era I couldn't believe what he had done and the lies. Obama was charismatic I have to give him that much, but I knew something was off. Then Trump came and my eyes opened fast. I witnessed the media change over night then and knew something was up. Years ago I voted for Jesse Ventura who was very underestimated to say the least. I went to the Innagral Ball. Had a blast. It was more of a concert for the people n not political one bit. When Ventura won, I saw the look on Humphrey Jr's face on live TV. They thought he had it in the bag. Boy was he wrong. Humphrey had this pissed off n very spiteful response to him. Sort of like Hillary had when Trump won __ __ __. Trump I've seen what he's done and we have to give him credit. He has and is doing what he said which is rare. He really is cleaning out the swamp. You hear him once in awhile mention the war we're in. It's the cold war against globalist I know. We see it playing out right now everywhere. I may not care for Trump's tweets, name calling, but he's not the run of the mill politician. In fact he's not a politician at all which is why he's our man to clean up a mess that years of abuse has created. He isn't afraid to take on the globalist in fact we've all seen it. Trump is fighting this war and we all need to back him. There's going to be a time when sitting on our hands isn't going to be enough. As a Christian and Conservative our America is under attack in a war that has yet to be labeled a war. It is a war of the very core of our American beliefs. The free country in the world. In the past several months we have all seen the Left in ways I can't imagine nor ever thought anyone could be like. There are Left in the Republican party as well and we all see who they are. The actions make them stand out now and show their true colors. I'm so grateful and blessed to be Republican now and I don't ever see going anywhere else. I'm very vocal on fb here and I've had many semi heated confrontation but in the end I've been victorious as I always win when Christ is in my heart.

I actually walked away several years ago, somewhere around 2011, so when I first saw Brandon's video, it really resonated with me. At the time I decided to walk away we were in the middle of electing our state's governor, and I was still a registered Democrat, but I had become increasingly aware that the Democrat party no longer reflected my views. I am a conservative Christian. I am pro-life, pro 2nd amendment, pro small-government, pro-israel pro-military, pro police, so I think you can see my dilemma. However, when our August primary rolled around I was still a registered Democrat. I just had not made the decision to leave yet, and so because my state has a closed primary I had to go vote as a Democrat, which I did and I just tried to vote for the things I could vote for in good conscience. That very day I left my voting precinct drove to the supervisor of elections office and changed my party and said I will never vote as a Democrat again. That was almost 9 years ago and what I thought was far- left at the time was probably really center-left compared to where the party is now and the full-on corruption and manipulation and deception and sometimes outright criminality you see from the Democrat party today. I just hope a lot more people wake up and a lot more people join the walk away movement. #Trump2020#Redpill#Walkaway"

I was here when the question was first asked for testimonies as to why members were walking away. IÕve loved reading everyoneÕs testimony & the photos as proof that we are not Russian Bots but true people! I have never posted my testimony before as I see how many are shared & I know there are repercussions. Now is the time for me to share my story. My political beliefs are not secret. I registered to vote in 1975 at the age of 18. The lady who took me was dear friends with my late Grandma & a very vocal member of the local Republican Party. When I was asked my political affiliation, she told them I was Republican. I was timid & unsure so I said nothing. The first presidential campaign I voted for was Jimmy Carter/Gerald Ford. I was a good Republican & voted Ford. Later I told my uncle who I had great respect for that I really wanted to vote for Carter but was afraid that my grandpa would ask & so I did not vote for him. My uncle informed me that voting was each of our right and that meant we vote for who we believe is best & if my grandpa was to ask, tell him it was none of his business as thatÕs why we stand behind a curtain to vote! I took his statements to heart & thereafter I always voted who I felt was best & not by political party. Over the years I have noticed I tend to vote more Republican on local level, equally on state level & Democrat on National level. I voted Carter 2nd term, Clinton both times & even Al Gore! I despised both of the BushÕs. Living in IL I seen that Obama was only about himself and spent more time campaigning than attending Senate meetings. IÕve truly been an Independent voter. In 2016 I supported Jeb Bush, followed by Marco Rubio & then Ted Cruz. Trump was my 4th choice. Under no circumstances could I ever vote for Hillary. I remember reading how she was rude to secret service, police & anyone she deemed beneath her. I remember her stealing from the WH. I remember her flippant Ôwhat difference does it makeÕ during Benghazi hearing. She stole from the children in Haiti & uses Clinton Foundation funds for personal gains. She stole again when she was Sec of State from the offices! The list could go on for hours but in the end my belief is she is extremely corrupt. I have a dear friend who kept sending me articles about Trump. She was an avid supporter of him & kept working on me. I hated his tweets over nonsense, the boasting & other aspects that I felt was not what I wanted in a president. I was accustomed to an elegant speaker but in time came to realize they just spoke what they thought we needed to hear not what they were going to do for us. IÕve lost family & friends over my political beliefs. IÕve had ÔfriendsÕ insinuate I am stupid for supporting Trump. None of that matters. Their opinions of me do not matter. I see Biden as a puppet for Obama, Soros & the far left socialists of the democrat party. I do not see the Democrat Party as it once was. I truly see it as the DemonRat party. I cannot ever vote again in my lifetime for a member of a party who believes in late term abortions, anti-semites, coastal elites, kissing up to Hollywood, lying media, pedophilia acceptance, illegals over citizens, etc. I wanted the wall built, people entering our country on merit basis & truly want to come because of the love of our country & to become a part of it. I want fair trade agreements. I want a president who thinks first & foremost of the USA. I cannot in good faith support a party who wants to defund our police, demand we wear masks & who knows what next. I cannot bear to listen to the media on channels that lie about the Republicans, claims that the rioting & violence taking place are peaceful or were until Fed came in & our president. I cannot ever support a party whoÕs true goal is complete dominance & control of every aspect of our life. They are a party of deflection - you can be sure that anything they accuse a Republican of is deflecting from the very thing they ARE doing! DemonRats destroy everything they gain control of - look at most of the large cities, look at our schools/colleges and the indoctrinations that have been taking place. Look at our beautiful statues, memorials & parks. This Nov I intend to vote straight Republican. There are some in this party I do not care for but to me if the choice is between a RINO that might be influenced to support Trump vs a DemonRat that we know will not, then I will hold my nose & vote red! IÕm praying that we keep the Senate & Trump in the WH & regain the other house. Trump has accomplished so much - just think what we could get done if we had more Republicans in both houses with a stronger majority. IÕm not posting a photo of me but rather of my 2 beloved dogs.#Trump2020NowMoreThanEver"

I changed my party affiliation to REPUBLICAN. I did so, because the DEMOCRATIC PARTY has been taken over by the radical left. Case in point, Karen Bass who BIDEN is considering as his running mate....VPOTUS. For those that do not know Ms. Bass was a member of the VENCEREMOS BRIGADE and frequently traveled to Cuba....please do a search on KAREN BASS VENCEREMOS BRIGADE. Another case in point, TOM PEREZ DNC CHAIRMAN publicly stated that there is NO ROOM IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR DEMOCRATS THAT ARE AGAINST ABORTION...( i am against abortion ) .... One last issue, which is my personal believe.....the main goal of the RADICAL LEFTISTS DEMOCRATS is to REPLACE THE US CONSTITUTION WITH THEIR SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION..... THANKS ...

From seeing other posts I can tell I am among friends and fellow patriots here. I have always been a registered Conservative Republican. I enlisted in the Navy at 18. I love America and consider myself to be blessed to have freedom. I have been places that do not have freedom. I can say that the National Anthem brings a tear to my eye when I salute because I think of all those who gave there life for liberty and freedom that unfortunately so many take for granted and disrespect. I believe in Life, Liberty and The Pursuit of Happiness for all. I gave an oath to protect that and that oath never expires. My core values are biblical principles because my lord and savior Jesus Christ is the core of my soul and I try to live a loving, giving and compassionate life as Jesus did. It breaks my heart to see the evil that is causing so much hate and destroying lives. I voted for Trump in 2016 and I will be voting for him again in 2020. LetÕs protect America and everything that she and Lady Liberty represent. May God Bless Americaland of the free and home of the brave. ____"

I was never very political and never declared to belong to any party. I would vote for whoever I felt was the best candidate regardless of party affiliation. I started to realize in my late 20s how the democratic party in our state controlled everything. Pay for play is the motto in Chicago and all over Illinois. It has always bothered me that if you wanted a job in this area you had better support every Democrat and vote for them, and the unions tell you who you need to vote for. Hard working people are denied jobs because of this corruption. Our state is in trouble because of the democrats who have run this state in order to line their own pockets. It also sickens me that they ignore all the violence happening in our streets and want to blame Trump for everything. Trump has not run this state, the democrats have and they keep taking away more and more of our liberties, and the same is happening across this great country. I cant understand why not buying into the victim mentality makes me a racist or privileged. I came from nothing and work for everything I have. I was a single mom raising 2 kids and yet I managed to get a college degree at 40 and change careers to better my life, as well as buy a small townhome. I dont have much more than that. Retirement in Illinois is impossible and honestly I'd rather move to a state where people are more aligned with my views of hard work and making your own way in life, not living off the government and demanding everyone change to please you. The left does nothing but divide this country. Yes there are racists still in this country, but the discrimination has more to do with culture than with the color of someone's skin. Trump is made out to be this awful person by the radical left, but he has done more to help this country than any Democrat ever will. I voted for him in 2016 and I will again in 2020.

Yes I voted for him 2 times. God forgive me. I saw the true racist then. He already had a long term and wasnÕt hiding it anymore. What did he have to lose? He couldnÕt be re=elected so he went whole hog. I was raised on Long Island, NY. My parents were apolitical. They could care less who was President. So I was the same way until meeting my Mother-in-law. She was a staunch liberal Kennedy Democrat. I knew nothing about politics so I was an empty canvass when I asked what was the difference between a Republican and a Democrat.i got an earful that day. I was like a blank canvass and I became indoctrinated vey quickly. By the time Clinton was voted in I was a happy camper. I didnÕt realize what critical thinking was I was just a political sheep. So thinking now,that my political beliefs were intact it made me feel empowered somehow. It wasnÕt until 2013 that something inside me wasnÕt right. I was not a Dem and it was starting to show. I had a good friend of mine and Co-worker that was a Republican we never really talked politics but looking back I can see he knew I was not a liberal. He would float ideas and see wantt my opinion was. Things that would make me think. ThatÕs when the critical thinking started. The things I was hearing from Obama and the left were just rubbing me the wrong way. I was starting to think of my self as more of an independent. That was my justification for not having All liberal beliefs. I started listening to Rush Limbaugh and I turned into a onservative. I am a Trumper. And now, my wife who wa brought up a Democrat is now a Conservative also. I vote for Trump in Ô16 and will vote again for him in Ô20. I have learned a lot in the past eight years and I looking forward to learning more. The Dems of today are not the Dems of 30 years ago. And I hope and pray that Trump gets four more years."

I was raised with conservative values that have protected me and kept me safe my whole life. I am so grateful for them. I am the Grand-daughter of hard working ranchers and a grandfather who did tons of service for those around him. I have always had the opinion that there are amazing and intelligent people in both parties and in fact really didnÕt like having to designate myself one way or another, because I want to do what I feel good about, not follow the crowd. I have seen the absolute suppression of individualism in that party that has grown to toxic proportions, I have seen hypocrisy, weaponizing the first amendment to break laws as well as suppress others rights at the same time, I have seen radio silence time after time when wrong things have happened if it didnÕt further their goals. I have been in absolute tears for my fellow Americans and country now for weeks. I have in the last 15 years for the first time in my country founded on Christianity, felt persecuted to be Christian, persecuted to be white, afraid to hang support signs for the candidates I feel are best for fear of being vandalized, I wouldnÕt dare wear a trump hat whether I supported him or not because I know I would have toxic hate or bodily injury, and the Democratic Party could feign that they arenÕt complicit in that, but they are. All I hear from their leadership are efforts to dehumanize anyone who gets in the way of their narrative and I feel like i am in China or Russia instead of my home. I have been censored, not even for posting conservative views but for reporting things that clearly should have violated community standards but it fit the lefts agenda so my report went rejected. Such as a private citizens address being shared on a hate site over 25,000 times. That didnÕt violate the standards but me reposting an image of what was being allowed online was immediately censored. We are in deep deep trouble our very freedoms are fundamentally being compromised. There is a very powerful and organized machine operating here that has been constructed over time. Only the truth and the first amendment can save us now, if the silent majority stands up, reports inappropriate censorship, and holds leadership accountable to the constitution. Our youth have been systematically liberalized in my opinion and donÕt understand how the constitution serves and protects everyone. A model that has been mimicked all over the world because of its intrinsic value."

IÕm a couple years late, but when I wrote this I thought Brandon recently posted the video. I stated the following in a message because I didnÕt know this group existed... itÕs pretty long so bear with me. Message to Brandon: Firstly, thank you for the walk away video. I never reach out to people on these things especially if I donÕt know them because I know I wonÕt here back... but I wanted to reach out thank you personally for your video #walkaway A FB post I wrote after watching the walk away video and share it with people I know, the post contained in its entirety: Not going to lie this hits close to home for me. Not too long ago I used to align myself solely with Liberal principles and and ideologies and to some extent I still do. It has been extremely difficult to describe exactly how and were I currently align myself in todayÕs current political landscape. However, in this video (watch the whole thing if you want to understand were people like me are coming from) Brandon Straka does an amazing job explaining why he has walked away from the Democratic Party and literally everything he says is pretty much on point with the reasons why I decided to walk away. Now, I donÕt choose to vote for a particular party purely on the bases that a person is a Democrat or Republican, I vote for the person and who I feel like will best represent me and this great country. A person who I feel will secure and safeguard its citizens and their futures. Consequently, liberal politicians who have assumed power or have retained it for a long period of time have failed to do just that. The same people who are blaming all of the countryÕs problems on a man who has only been in office for 3 years are the same people have been in office for decades, some for 50 years (like Biden). However, these very people insist on blaming the country, itÕs people, and our president for problems that have persisted and continue to persist for decades, when these people have had the power to fix it and mend the divide long before Trump took office, but failed to do so. Hate me all you want, (referring to people and friends on FB) but I refuse to align myself with a political party who blames the world and its problems on its people and a president with 3 years of political experience. In reality, these people, Pelosi, Feinstein, Biden, Nadler... the list goes on, were the ones that caused and created these problems and continue to widen and deepen the divide facing our great country today. They have had the time and the power to unite and repair this nation, but instead they have taken our money, belittled, humiliated, and attempted a coup detat of a man whose views did not align with theirs. I donÕt want someone who is is controllable, fake, and willing to sacrifice his or her ideals and principles because they fail to conform and support the current narrative. I donÕt want someone who lies, cheats, and steals, to get into a position of power. I donÕt want someone who will sacrifice his or her flag, country, and itÕs citizens to appease a party who frankly does not give a crap about me. I would rather have someone in a position of power who says it like it is, calls out corrupt politicians, attacks fake news, is proactive, and who is willing to defend our country, itÕs flag, itÕs citizens, and its history. That is the person who I will be voting for. There is only one person falls into that criteria and will get my vote come November and that man is Donald J. Trump! #walkaway Again, thank you speaking up for people like me who canÕt really express how they feel about today current climate."

I guess you can say my walk away story isnt your traditional one. I never was a liberal or a Democrat. Never leaned left either. Going up, I always considered myself a Republican. But after serving in the Army for 9 years and being a history major in college, I realized, I wasn't really feeling being a Republican either. I do have some Libertarian views, such as my views on taxes. Anyways, I'm as American as you can get. And realized, I'm a Constitutionalist. I believe in Rights and Equality for ALL Americans. Regardless if you agree of disagree with someones opinion, its their right to have that opinion. And I respect that right. I might not agree with you but that is the beauty of being an American. The right to have your own opinion. While I see that the Conservative political side isn't perfect. It is pro-America and pro-American citizen. I recognize that the liberal mindset is destroying traditional American values and Constitutional Rights. When I joined the Army in 1995 I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution again all enemies foreign and domestic. When I got out in 2004, nobody relieved me of that oath. I will continue to fight more my country and its people. So help me God. I don't know where I was truly going with this rant honestly. I'm just so proud to see so many peoples stories on the daily though. The left is so full of hate and divide. The right, regardless what media tell you, is so much more accepting and loving. And you see it here. Yup, we have our bad apples. But every family has that Nutt Ball Uncle. I love all you people. And as long as I have a breath in my body, I will continue to stand for you."
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3524578354228714,"IÕve been a member of this group for a year now and itÕs the best group IÕve even been a part of. Comment often but have never offered my testimonial because I felt that IÕve always been here and never Òwalked awayÓ myself but realize itÕs not just about that, itÕs about being ÒpartÓ of all of this and without posting myself I am merely an observer and feel like an outsider so here goes. I was born and raised in New York and joined the Marine Corps when I was 18. After graduation and for a few years to follow many of my elder relatives, uncles, aunts, cousins would always tell me how proud they were of me that I had made something good of myself after having such a terrible child hood. It seems this went in until all of them had the opportunity to say that to me. At the time I really didnÕt realize what they were talking about, that was until I had children of my own who I dedicate my life to. My children came first and foremost in my life and there was nothing I would not do for them or give them short of spoiling. I had left the Marine Corps in 1994 after serving my country for 14 years, accepted a job with a start up Aviation parts supplier and found myself voluntarily working 12, 14, 16 hours a day sometimes 6 or 7 days a week even though I was paid flat salary and not compensated for these extra hours just because I was fully committed to the company that I worked for. That paid off and my efforts were recognized and I was given great opportunities in life that I would otherwise not have had. Loyalty, hard work, self responsibility all paid off and I owe that to my beloved Marine Corps who really saved my life and set my on my journey in life equipped and fully prepared. My father disappeared from our lives when I was 6, my mother worked two jobs to support myself and three older sisters who one by one, became my mother in the absence of my real mom. Not long after my dad disappeared my mother required open heart surgery which in 1967 was a really dangerous procedure. My sisters continued raising me, we went on welfare had social workers at the house while my mother spent nearly 6 months recovering. Times were tough I was bullied constantly by kids in the neighborhood and to put it bluntly wasnÕt very smart because I was being raised by my sisters who were children themselves. When I was 12 my mom married and we moved upstate New York they bought a bar and restaurant that we lived above and life seemed to be taking a turn for the best. That lasted about a year until my parents had become full blown alcoholics and gave me little if any guidance, support or life lessons. I had very little supervision and at the age of 13 I started getting high, drinking and it didnÕt help that I had more access to alcohol. IÕd made the JV football team but my parents never even congratulated me, came to any games so I quit, same thing with baseball and track so that left me with nothing better to do then get high and drink more. My stepfather was very abusive verbally not physically although his verbal threats were often backed by the threat of physical violence where he would take off his glasses and get in my face asking me if I wanted a piece of him. My mother was to drunk most of the time to step in and protect me and was left to defend myself but only submitted. Besides the non stop berating I had to endure I would get punished for a month on the first day of summer for something my step brother who was only 3 months younger then I would do, I was punished all the time and was alone without anyone to hear my side or intervene on my behalf which drive me to get into other drugs and drink even more. When I was 14 I was again punished for the rest of my life for what I canÕt even remember and while watching tv my step father came into the living room to take a nap. I was paralyzed with fear and didnÕt even want to get up and leave because I knew that would trigger him so I just sat there watching tv and saying nothing. It didnÕt take him long to start in on my while he laid back in the couch telling me what a waste and a failure I was and then he said the unimaginable Òyou will never amount to anything are are going to grow up to be a bum like your dad wasÓ . I snapped, it was like I heard a loud thud in my head, saw a flash of light and ringing in my ears, I jumped from the chair, ran to the couch, threw I grabbed the coffee table and hurled it across the room. I leaned over him yelling for him to get up and that I was going to kick his ass. I may have been 14 but was 5ÕÓ10 and 175 lbs and was very fit. He just laid there and didnÕt move and for the first time I saw fear in his eyes. I kept yelling for him to get up and was becoming more and more enraged with every moment. I grabbed him by the throat and dragged him off the couch and was choking him as I yelled and screamed. My mother downstairs heard it and came running up, she was trying to pull me off but I (truncated)"
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945356878817544/permalink/3524577584228791,"I walked away about 8months ago. I had been brainwashed for many years. I voted for Obama twice because I thought it would bring peace and also the narrative that the Republican party was just for rich people (I was very poor) and Democrats were for the working class (union job) and Democrats were for the little guys. But I never in my life believed in handouts like the democrats loved to brag about...probably bc I now realize that I've always been 95% a conservative Republican and didn't even know it. Through hard work and dedication (the American way) I pulled myself out of poverty and have become successful. About 8 months ago I was tired of a radio station so I figured I would flip to what I knew was a country station. Well it had been turned into a conservative talk show station with Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, etc (guys I'd never heard of in my 32yrs of life) holy moly did it open my eyes. It was right before Glenn put Ukraine: The Final Piece on youtube. I watched that and my mind was blown! That lead me down the rabbit hole of research on so many topics, finding so many facts, and finding/learning about people like Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan, and Tim Scott, Candace Owens, Mark Levin, etc. My life changed rapidly. I finally realized that all my thoughts and beliefs that I had formed throughout my life about how I should work to be better and get further in life are the roots of conservatism. I have learned SO much about our great history in the past several months. I feel better, more knowledgeable, and definitely more confident in my beliefs. I will NEVER in my life vote blue again. Thank god for Mr President Donald J Trump, Bill Barr, Lindsey Graham, and every good hearted, true American that is fighting day in and day out to keep our country first, safe, and keep Americans free! -Addition- I'd also like to add to my post that the absolute love, respect, union, and heartfelt care among the Right is beyond words!

He worked for the US Post Office from age 18 up until he retired at 56. When Obama was running for office something in my father changed. In our family this change was extremely radical because he was the rock we clung too. I resisted that change so much. And then one day we sat down and had a very lengthy discussion as to what brought this on. The points he outlined couldn't be denied. It made me want to learn more. I started researching everything I could get my hands on from Soros, Obama, the deep state, And this angered me immensely. The party we had grown up in didn't exist anymore. Honestly up until this point I didn't really even care about politics. This was my awakening. This was my very stubborn, painful rebirth from a 32 year old Democrat to a Republican and I never looked back. I will never look back. My father. Who was still the wisest man id ever known up until his death wasn't a quitter. But he quit being a Democrat. I will remember that day of awakening as detailed as I remember where I was on 9/11."

First I acknowledge there is absolutely good and bad on both sides. The extremes can and often become dangerous. When I was younger I was pretty darn conservative I got married at 17 and had my family very very young. I found my faith at 17 coming from a non religious family on my mom's side they were hurt pretty bad by the church. My dad's side were Catholic. I became a Christian at 17 after experiencing God in my own life separate from both. I experienced a lot in my young years which has given me tremendous compassion for all walks of life. After coming into my faith I wanted like so many new believers to save the world which I had to learn I could never do, I had to learn to be present with my light on. I through my years of raising my children being married and interacting with people of every race culture and faith came to realize love and compassion are the key to being a light in this world. I found myself moved away from staunch conservative belifes to understanding that life and love thrives in freedom,grace,and peace. I began to take people into consideration despite their walk of life and made amazing friends along the way. Art introduced me to beautiful artistic people who's open minds have been a blessing to get to know. Musicians and their amazing ability to bring joy,heartache,and love into light through the incredible gift of song. I saw love deep and true shared between hedrosexual and homosexual people. I saw a world in need and in search of one thing that being love. I grew up in South Florida were every color and culture lived together it shocked me when I moved here that racism was so rampant 25 years ago. I taught my children that God made all of mankind and life should be cherished. As the years went on I had a hard time with politics all the anger and hate expressed between these parties I felt my vote wouldn't matter and saw good and bad in both parties. In the last two elections I did not vote especially the last one. I did not believe either party was good. I felt I still had a voice and my voice would be no on both. I have watched this country disintegrate and all that I took for granted crack before my eyes. I have heard vote for the less of two evils which pains my heart. So I began to watch, listen, and try to understand both parties. This all during a pandemic. My father's children always said you will know the true nature of a person when it comes to their money and their ass is on the line so I watched and listened. What I have seen and heard has pushed me more to the right because hate has been rampant violence, bullying, and the desire to implode this country. No side is perfect and I am still learning but when the countries ass was on the line the left exploded out of the gates creating division,hate, and violence when we needed love,peace, and encouragement more than ever. The. Far Left Democratic party fueld it and it has sickened me. It's made me question everything. The attacks I have personally experienced have just solidified my questioning. I love all of you and just want peace, a free safe country to live in, and for hope to not be lost."

I grew up in a small town in southern Missouri to two parents that worked hard to raise 2 kids. We didn't have much ,but had everything we needed . My grandmother was a die hard Democrats that raised a family during the depression and wouldn't have voted for a Republican if it would save her life. My dad was the same way. I myself always voted for the candidate instead of the party so sometimes I disagree with my dad. I voted for Obama the first round as I wasn't happy with Bush and I believed hope and change. In about his third year I realized he was a fraud and wasn't changing anything or give any hope. When he won a second term as I Seen it he put into play the total destruction of our health care system and the way employers hire worker because health care skyrocketed which employers respond by working people part with no benefits and it's only got worse ever since. I've set here the last 5 years through the democratic process they have implemented to destroy America to gain the power back at any cost. It is total disgusting to watch them and the media ( Facebook , Twitter, and all the news and news papers) doing everything to get Trump out at ALL COST to the American people. Now I will address BLM Thing .I don't believe in blm because all American lives matter from the homeless, drug addicts, veterans, aborted children everyone. There are people of every nationality kill by people of all nationalities every day in this country and no one life is above the other,every life is important. Democrats are fueling the destruction to gain the upper hand against Trump at any cost to America. I've never felt like I was ever better than a black person as I just never was around many to understand them. Slavery was wrong and their are many injustices that happen is this word to alot of people. I've seen racism in people of all nationalities not just whites and I would be will to bet the 100% have shown racism towards someone even though they try hard not to and know it's wrong .we all have sin and come short of the glory of God and that's why we have forgiveness. I hate what's going on in this country to the point that I feel hopeless to change anything, I'm angry and disgusted that i want to WALKAWAY from everything. My soul hurts for America like it's my hope dying. If we don't come together as Americans !!! Not black Americans !!! Not white Americans but as Americans this country is doomed. I've rambled on enough and I hope it makes sense to everyone. If I've offered anyone it's not my intention. Please can we heal this country."

You all have given me the courage to speak the truth, to be honest with myself and to be open with the world. Thank you all for this gift!__ I shared these words on my page tonight, and I'd like to share them with all of you because I feel like it sums up my #walkaway experience pretty accurately. Thanks again! Your stories and voices have truly changed my life and given me so much HOPE! I have debated about whether or not to post something about an incident that recently occurred, but I've decided to do so in order to shed light on the state of things currently, in our lives and all around the world. I'm sure most of you have noticed, or the ones who pay attention to what I post anyway LOL, that I've been pretty political lately. A far cry from my standard baby pictures and whatnot. I've never been more vocal or actively involved in politics than I am now and it's because I'm frightened by the political climate. I'm frightened by the fact that the media plays such an integral role in our lives that it has divided us whether family, friends or coworkers. I wish we could go back to a time where we could have opposing views and still be friendly or at the very least civil to one another. I wish that people didn't feel the need to throw away friendships and point accusatory fingers at people and assume anything about their beliefs based on textbook definitions of political affiliation. I have been honest and open about the fact that I feel pretty centered if slightly right-leaning and I have friends all across the board and that's totally okay! I'm not here to preach and I'm not here to admonish you or tell you you're wrong or evil or bigoted or anything else for feeling the way that you feel but unfortunately there is a subgroup of people in this country now - I really don't think they are the majority, not even a little -and I'm sorry if this term has become overly saturated but I feel it's accurate - the radical left who is not open to conversation, who is not open to understanding or being tolerant like they claim or even treating you like a human being any longer. If you don't agree with them 100%, you are the enemy. You are all of the things that are bad in this world. Racist, bigoted, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-semitic etc. Just the other day I received a message from someone that started off innocently enough and it really seemed like this person wanted to hear my opinion and why I felt the way that I did. We had a brief dialogue that was simple but I felt it coming around the corner, I felt her powering up to hit me with some wokeness and not from a teaching perspective but instead from a scolding one. She lashed out at me and called me a bunch of inaccurate names and ended the conversation with her assumptions about me and then proceeded to remove me from her group. A group where I have purchased many items for my daughter, a group that I have supported for quite some time. She threw me away without a second thought. This is why I cannot and will not support an administration who would like to continue down this path disguised as righteousness when in all actuality is truly tyrannical and oppressive in its design. I joined a group called #WalkAwayCampaign several weeks ago and have watched it grow exponentially in the short time I have been a member. It is the most inspirational, inclusive, diverse and patriotic group I've ever encountered. It is made up of people from all walks of life who see what's going on in this world and can no longer blindly walk the path that ultimately would have us tearing down our country and punishing those who do not agree with us 100%. They call it liberation, they claim that they are tolerant but how can you say you are tolerant when you can't even have a conversation with somebody? I really truly hope that all of you begin to read further than just the headlines. Read the policies, read opposing views, read real journalism that isn't based solely on emotions and opinions but facts and statistics. Like I said, the walkaway campaign is comprised of people from all walks of life. It was founded by a former liberal and a gay man who began to question the narrative and was then shunned by his own community for doing so. It's not just strict conservatives that make up the group, it's a collective of people who have started to feel more and more disillusioned by what is going on and it's almost like a new party affiliation has sprung from it. A party of acceptance and tolerance and patriotism. it's a place where you can express your opinions openly and honestly and without fear and I can tell you, not everybody in there feels the same way. There are people who are religious, some are atheist, there are gay people, straight people, trans people, black, white and yellow people, we are all just PEOPLE who value (truncated)"

I ran Democratic hard for many years. Hell I love Bill Clinton he was down to earth ate Burger could relate to the people that was what I thought I know now. Got on board with Obama because he was black and he could relate because I was in the same boat as most blacks not only because I date out of my race but because chose to follow the ladder instead of the greater. My eyes really opened up when Trump came into office. I wanted to hate him. Hell that was what was programmed in me. But with today's internet. I started seeing things. UC I come from a 15-year addiction of crack cocaine. 10 years clean under my belt. I'm not nowhere near where I want to be but I'm not where I used to be. Anyway back to the story I started seeing the hate put forth towards this person. I said there's a reason there's a reason they're going so hard for this President let me watch. And that's exactly what I did watch. I did research I studied up and I realized the Democratic party is dictator for slavery from the beginning I seen how they were trying to keep the blinders old over the poor and black eyes. I started calculating the money that is missing from the government coming from our pockets. Man oh man oh man are these people getting rich off of us. With six candidates alone in the Democratic party. They've been in office for over 300 years combines District Falling by the wayside high crime rates homeless population flowing like a cesspool including Tent City. In the meantime I noticed Democrats becoming billionaires off of our money. I became a Republican you see I'm a felon so for many years I could not vote. In the State of Florida felons can vote now me and my better half have received our voters cards and we both will be using our voices we will be one of the ones being heard from 2020

I grew up in the Air Force and have always been very patriotic, supportive and respectful of our country and our presidents. This year after watching what the Democrats have done to our country the lies the criminal activities and the destruction of our cities. The largest child trafficking ring in the US. I can no longer support their hate I see for our country and our children.I feel they are using this virus to win the election and control people. Witnessing the democratics lack of respect for our country and its people has sickened me and has moved me to no longer associate with the Democratic Party. IÕm now a full hearted republican. Trump 2020"

Trump threw his proverbial hat in the ring I was extremely happy I didnÕt hesitate for one minute changing my voting status from Democratic Party to the Republican Party and voted for candidate Trump when he won against crooked Hilderbeast I was elated IÕm definitely not sorry I voted for President Trump this month IÕll be 80 and I plan to vote for him again President Trump has kept the majority of his campaign promises heÕs doing a tremendous job under great pressure from the leftist Democrats I hope and pray that President Trump is healthy and safe throughout his second term ____________________________________________________________

I bounced back and forth between the 2 political views since I could vote. I believe women's bodies are their own and whatever they choose to do with them, then that is not for me to judge. I believe in the LGBT community and that they should have the same rights as all citizens do. I ALSO believe that democrats have enslaved minorities with entitlements. So, I guess I am middle of the road. I do not subscribe to the extremes of either side and am so tired of seeing the race baiting going on. I worked as a police dispatcher for 20 years in a liberal city and never once heard of one of our deputies targeting minorities. I now work in N GA as a 911 dispatcher where we have no racial problems, and the few liberals here (transplants) planned a BLM rally. BLM speakers and participants were bussed in and needless to say didn't stay long in our small, conservative community. I was raised by parents who provided me with the basics and a lot of love and had me work for the rest...and work I have. I am sad to admit I didn't vote for Trump or Killery last election. I wrote in this nation's voice of reason, Mike Rowe. This November, President Trump will be on my ballot. Thanks for reading :)"

I have been a registered Democrat along with four other members of my family for 45 years. I did not vote for Donald Trump, simply because I was a Democrat. I accepted him being our President and thought its only four years. Immediately I started seeing major results, positive results, saw our jobs returning, our borders being secured, and realized how much of our country had been taken away from us so I watched and kept an open mind. Now I am shocked at the Democratic party and the lengths they have went to. My whole family will walk away in November and I pray others come to their senses, and realize how our Country really has been controlled. I am sick of the anger, violence and senselessness of what is going on and know with all my heart it is fueled by the Democratic Party. Now they bring out a candidate that is not capable of even debating or showing his face, which is more positive proof, that the country is controlled by the Party."

I have never, truthfully, followed Politics as much as I have for this 2020 election in my life. It has led me to become a Republican/ conservative. I've realized that my views are not of the Democratic Party. Nothing about myself has changed... just that my vision has become clear. I grew tired of arguing with people that cannot hear. So I chose to #WalkAway"

I told my husband we need to change our political standing From democrat that we had been voting for ever like lambs To the slaughter, I sure was not going to be voting for the hilabeast. So my thing was at that time was the men that lost thier lives in benghazi because Of her order to the men that could have helped them to stand down, now I am a mother of two sons, if they would have been the ones that got killed and drug through the streets naked cattle proded they would have to put me in jail to keep me from her. Here is another reason I'm voting For the president he owes no one No one is in his pocket. TRUMP2020__"
