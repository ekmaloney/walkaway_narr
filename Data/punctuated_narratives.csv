0,_1K_KTlorhU,hello my walk away brothers and sisters my name is wayne fisher i live just outside of reading pennsylvania being from pennsylvania and having lived here for over 20 years i was very proud to see that pennsylvania put president trump over the electoral college votes that he needed to win the 2016 election um as long as i've lived here i've never seen this state go red so it was fantastic to see um i shared a walk away written testimonial back in august but with brandon asking for more videos i decided i would try to put one together i apologize if it's a little awkward because i don't usually do videos but i wanted to put one together today um first i wanted to thank brandon because this movement has been fantastic i learned about it a little over a year ago but just didn't take the time to to really look into it but back in august when i did i started reading some of the testimonials from you guys and watching the videos and it was amazing um i have gotten so much inspiration from you guys and everything that you guys put out there um you know i was a registered democrat for years although i will say that i didn't vote party i usually voted for the candidate that i thought was going to do the best job i am middle-aged so i've been voting for quite a while voted for george bush i bought into the idea of change with barack obama and voted for him twice uh regrettably because at the end of his term i watched the economy tank i watched jobs leave i watched his hatred of the country of our police force and our freedoms became um attacked under his administration so um even through all that i truly felt the need to walk away shortly after trump announced his candidacy um i got to watch the left show its intolerance in force um any questioning or disagreement with their um policies or procedures or their uh goals it was just met with bullying and intimidation and trying to silence any other voice that dared to think for themselves or disagree with them so um you know it became more and more evident that uh the liberal progressive democrats hated me um you know i feel like to them i'm one of the five worst things or five of the worst things you can be in this country right now you know i'm white and i'm male first so you know white means that i'm racist i'm privileged i'm supremacist even though i can't change the color of my skin that's what i am to them uh i'm male so i'm misogynist or i am toxically masculine whatever that means um you know three four and five i'm heterosexual i'm christian and i'm middle aged so i must be homophobic or intolerant um hateful due to my generation my faith and my sexual orientation those also contribute to hatefulness apparently and i just found out you can't say sexual preference because that is a judgmental term so learned that this past week um you know i've been told that i've uneducated i've been told that by people who didn't know me by people who knew me even though and they knew my character they've called me a lot of these words based on our arguments just trying to silence me but the more they tried the more vocal i became in this so um one of the things that i shared a few days ago on my facebook page was some of the similarities and stories that i'd seen on this walk away page and they really struck me and as we're getting into the last week and a half going toward election i thought that it might be something that's that's worth talking about so you know i look at a lot of stories and a lot of people were taught that republicans were for the rich and the democrats were for the working class and if you look now you can see how republicans are working for that working class the parties aren't the same as what they used to be or what they were thought to be um a lot of people just like me voted for obama and did so purely because he was black in a lot of cases and felt he could bring about some racial unity which just didn't happen um you know a lot of people hated trump in 2016 and you read a lot of these stories and people either abstained from voting or voted for the libertarian candidate they knew they couldn't vote for hillary and they like he said abstained or voted for the libertarian candidate and these votes went to neither the democrats nor the republicans so it's great to see that they're coming for trump this time once people were locked down from covet it's amazing to see how people started to do their own research and what they learned and really started to watch what the president was saying versus what was being reported and so many people who thought the idea of fake news was just a talking point saw what the fake news is really getting away with they're no longer reporting stories they are reporting their opinions to us and trying to get us swayed to their opinions um you know people started recognizing the hypocrisy and you know i started to see people recognizing the hypocrisy and the political wrangling around this virus um how it became an excuse to take away some of our freedoms and still is in a lot of cases um it's encouraging to see that lawsuits are already being won by businesses that are standing up against what their state governments did and again a lot of cases these are democratic state governments and just the continued means of trying to control us through this is very disheartening people saw the riots and the lawlessness that for months went unaddressed by the democrats and it was a huge eye-opener biden and the harris administration wouldn't even acknowledge them until it started to hurt their poll numbers and you know this is about our citizenry and protecting the people um you know there's so many people like i did that experienced hatred and vitriol from friends upon stating their support for president trump um even people who knew like i said even in my case that knew me for years so the left has adopted a strategy of bullying and intimidation to silence the conservatives so that we would have a fear of reprisal so it helped to create a real silent majority um i saw many lgbtq stories on the walk away site stating that coming out as a trump supporter was even harder than coming out as gay or um whatever place they fall on that scale i'm sorry i know that sounded awkward i'm sorry so um but i the one thing that really struck me is most people feel like they didn't leave the party the party left them and and i would agree with that wholeheartedly so um this election is absolutely for the soul of our country and we need to get out there and we need to vote end mass for president trump and we need a red wave at every level in the senate in the house in state government we need to support our president it's definitely the future of our country and again i thank brandon for this movement i thank all of you for sharing your stories i hope that mine touched somebody as well so god bless president trump god bless the usa god bless all of you you,"Hello, my walk away, brothers and sisters. My name is wayne fisher.

I shared a walk away, written testimonial back in august, but with brandon asking for more videos I decided I would try to put one together. I apologize if it's a little awkward, because I don't usually do videos, but I wanted to put one together today, um. First, I wanted to thank brandon because this movement has been fantastic. I learned about it a little over a year ago, but just didn't take the time to to really look into it, but back in august, when I did, I started reading some of the testimonials from you guys and watching the videos, and it was amazing um.

It was just met with bullying and intimidation and trying to silence any other voice that dared to think for themselves or disagree with them so um. You know it became more and more evident that uh, the liberal, progressive democrats hated me um. You know I feel like to them, I'm one of the five worst things or five of the worst things you can be in this country. Right now you know I'm white and I'm male first. So you know white means that I'm racist, I'm privileged, I'm supremacist, even though I can't change the color of my skin. That's what I am to them, uh, I'm male, so I'm misogynist or I am toxically masculine whatever that means um. You know three four and five: I'm heterosexual, I'm christian and I'm middle aged, so I must be homophobic or intolerant, um, hateful due to my generation, my faith and my sexual orientation.

1,_8dPBY0pn6A,hi Barbara millions of us would like to know why are you and many other blacks walking away from the Democrats let's hear your testimony well it's about time that we awaken from the slumber that they have put us into and they use the school system they use the fact that we many of us come from broken homes they use the media they use Hollyweird in every place to influence black people to keep them in office and in power yes while their communities are crumbling communities that the Democrats are controlling up front they're getting richer and richer by the election they don't want to get out of office because that's their bread and that's their butter and they forget about their constituents why didn't I work and walk away you can't grow up in a church taught about God who says love thy neighbor and then stick be loyal why I say that hate the basement remember slavery but I also remember that God allowed it and if I love God I have to be like Joseph mm-hmm and say what man meant for evil God meant for good mm-hmm because the good of it is I am an American citizen I didn't have to leave my mother my father my cousin's my and come to America for freedom I was born in the freest country that there is why I walked away because I felt controlled by people who use the only at election time more on the television telling you that the Republicans are for the rich telling you that the Republicans are racist telling you telling you telling you to keep them in office so they can get richer and poor people can get four I came to the conclusion that they were being selfish they will be even when they said that old people eating dog food I realize that that was a lie way back when because cat food and dog food is expensive oh boy expensive litter and spam Oh tuna that's right but so I came to the conclusion then I was following lines I was a faithful member and it's mentioned in my book escaping the racism of low expectations i gauge of the conclusion and I was being lied to I came to the conclusion that I can't serve God and he did whitening mostly I came colorful powerful that I wanted to be mentally free right and think for myself right I tell people don't you Rudolph Giuliani why against david dinkins because I thought he'd be better for New York then my scope broad I said who would be the best friend for America yeah so that's why I walked away deceit delusional dust will spread over my brain like so many blacks still walking around with that gun that gives them no place but in the state of hating people for no calling people racist when they don't have any evidence you have to be slow function low functioning or purposely ignoring the truth to continue on that path of deception what's best for America that's right what's most pleasing to God on this country and it is walking away from though down with killing up with killing maintenance move on no course only the law yeah people who have illegally come here sanctuary when citizens have no sanctuary right no I couldn't continue on that panel I didn't continue and I'm so happy that now I can truly say free at last free at last thank God Almighty I'm freaky,"Hi Barbara millions of us would like to know. Why are you and many other blacks walking away from the Democrats? Let's hear your testimony? Well, it's about time that we awaken from the slumber that they have put us into and they use the school system. They use the fact that we, many of us come from broken homes. They use the media. They use Hollyweird in every place to influence black people to keep them in office and in power. Yes, while their communities are crumbling communities that the Democrats are controlling up front they're, getting richer and richer by the election, they don't want to get out of office because that's their bread and that's their butter and they forget about their constituents. Why didn't I work and walk away? You can't grow up in a church, taught about God who says love thy neighbor and then stick be loyal. Why I say that hate the basement? Remember slavery, but I also, remember that God allowed it and if I love, God I have to be like Joseph mm-hmm and say what man meant for evil. God meant for good mm-hmm, because the good of it is I am an American citizen. I didn't have to leave my mother, my father, my cousin's my and come to America for freedom. I was born in the freest country that there is why I walked away because I felt controlled by people who use the only at election time more on the television telling you that the Republicans are for the rich, telling you that the Republicans are racist, telling you telling you telling you to keep them in office, so they can get richer and poor people can get. Four I came to the conclusion that they were being selfish. They will be even when they said that old people eating dog food I realize that that was a lie way back when, because cat food and dog food is expensive, oh boy, expensive, litter and spam Oh tuna, that's right, but so I came to the conclusion. Then I was following lines: I was a faithful member, and it's mentioned in my book escaping the racism of low expectations. I gauge of the conclusion and I was being lied to I, came to the conclusion that I can't serve God and he did whitening mostly I came colorful powerful that I wanted to be mentally free right and think for myself right, I tell people, don't you Rudolph Giuliani? Why? Against david dinkins, because I thought he'd be better for New York, then my scope, broad I, said who would be the best friend for America yeah. So that's why I walked away deceit. Delusional dust will spread over my brain, like so many blacks still walking around with that gun. That gives them no place, but in the state of hating people for no calling people racist when they don't have any evidence, you have to be slow function, low, functioning or purposely ignoring the truth to continue on that path of deception. What's best for America, that's right, what's most pleasing to God on this country, and it is walking away from, though down with killing up with killing maintenance move on no course only the law yeah people who have illegally come here sanctuary when citizens have no sanctuary right. No I couldn't continue on that panel. I didn't continue and I'm so happy that now I can truly say free at last free at last. Thank God, Almighty, I'm freaky."
2,_cJJzsiTClg,hi I'm grace this is my walk away video I'm walking away from the Democratic Party because I believe they elected Trump I think they did this by manipulating identity politics to their advantage without realizing that the country was tired of identity politics so when Trump became president I had to know why I hated the disgusted me I was in shock and denial I had to know why and I was actually curious unlike a lot of my liberal friends who did the easy thing and assumed that half of the United States is racist I thought that was possible but I really did want to know why he was my president so instead of radicalizing to the movement of he's not my president I stepped back a little bit because I had I was curious I started researching I started listening to everything I could and all the different news sources even Fox News I know and listening to academics on YouTube trying to figure out why this happened and what I found was that people were I would people were tired of identity politics I mean they were tired of the left always talking about people's race or racism always talking about people's sex or sexism always talking about all of the ist's and as if it were happening everywhere all the time it was just a buzz thing it was like manipulating it manipulating the latest trend to get your platform essentially because what I what I started to see when I actually did research was things don't get better when the Democrats are in office it's not like the ghettos are getting better quite the opposite ends up being true so I started actually thinking about politics in general and I started to well I don't think ever had a gray a great grasp on politics I did the party line you know I I'm a person who loves people and I think people should have rights so I'll vote Democrats I mean most of us are pretty stupid and I think the Democratic Party knows that and I think with the Republican Party knows that too but um anyway I learned a lot about politics I learned about a lot about government in economics and and then I realized wow I started seeing radical radicalizing you know left's leftists getting violent organizing in groups that promote violence it's so and suddenly I realized oh maybe I'm not on maybe there isn't a good side and bad side maybe both sides can be corrupt and you know I'm exhausted by identity politics too I hate the idea that you have to be a woman why can't I be a human you know I am woman but it's not like I have to walk up to people and that's what I expect you to see and you know liberals expect people to see when when you see someone you have to see what color are they what gender are they are they gay I know I need to know I mean they might know more than I do because there's this hierarchy of oppression I mean here's the Orthodox doctrine there's a hierarchy of oppression I need to know where you're at because if I'm more impressed than you are then what I say holds more weight if you're more oppressed than I am I yield to what you say as true it's if you think about it it is ridiculous why can't we be human why can't we be Americans why can't we be those things first especially when it's related to politics and economics and business and government and so I started to see that that this this boogeyman all right was smaller than people on the Left made it out to be and here's how I know because the second that illiberal questions identity politics or questions democratic policy they're alright they're being called out right even though they're not and then I started to realize that all right is this huge boogeyman that's actually way smaller like the actual racist the actual bigots they are a pretty small group I think because if you don't conform to the orthodoxy you're out I lost a lot of friends Oh most of my friends at this point of my life I spent a couple decades in academia and liberal circles I mean I led the rally I led the way let's just say that I converted more people to feminism you know so the point is you question one thing and suddenly your friends are radio silent and you're on the outside and they just cannot believe that you've turned into a thrice this horrible human being it's like it makes you step back further and go what the hell is happening and it makes you not want to participate in it because you recognize that as the equal opposite of the all right the when Trump became president the girls started to radicalize and they're going on the extreme and turning into some kind of crazy out left I mean organizing into violent groups it's like totally unacceptable to me so I I still have liberal values but I am NOT a Democrat I might not even be a liberal I might not even be willing to call myself a liberal anymore based on what I'm seeing and based on how I'm being treated by liberals frankly and I'm starting to see if these violent liberals get into government well first they're all for communism and socialism so well there goes the United States of America but second I don't want those people having big government I thought there might be a group of good people if we had big government it would be great and maybe they'd bring in the Utopia No you know maybe I am a conservative maybe I don't want big government so I'm starting to think those thoughts you know now that I'm freed from liberal friends who have no good argument because they're not talking I can act we start thinking about those things so I'm leaving the Democratic Party,"Hi I'm grace this is my walk away: video I'm walking away from

3,_dNmDQ5AHis,hey guys uh my name is paulie letofsky and i have been following brandon and walk away in fact i give to him and his patreon account every month so i've been a big fan been watching all your videos frankly never even occurred to me to do my own i don't know why i thought my story wasn't um dramatic enough or whatever but he put out a plea today to post your videos and i and i promised that i would so i guess here's my uh walk away long time ago now i'm a walk with okay so i i was a democrat grew up in in the liberal cesspool of america minneapolis in the liberal family love them but i am the black sheep and then i just thought that you know democrats were nice people and republicans were mean i guess that's kind of what i've been hearing all across your videos too and that's very much my story so as i went through my life i lived in big cities now please forgive me but i lived in boston and i remember going out to rally for ted kennedy oh my god please forgive me but then michael dukakis oh it's just horrible so i live you would think by my bio that i would be a liberal growing up in minneapolis living in cities i am in a creative field which generally is liberal i'm in the publishing world i am a single woman i've never been married i don't have kids so those are all sort of traits for being a liberal so no one would ever guess i'm not necessarily religious nothing like that so a half jewish half lutherans i got liberal written all over me but no i mean honestly if i would have taken a test probably when i was six i probably would have said you know you're a republican you're conservative because i've had these same values but i just they were misplaced so that's what i am so i had this dream my whole life to go walk around the world when i was 12 growing up in minneapolis i read a story of a guy that when walked around the world and i'm like oh i want to go do that that's how i wanted to go explore the world but when i was 12 it was 1974 and 12 and you just 12 year old girls don't grow up and go walk around the world so it was kind of this hidden dream of mine and i tucked it inside my head and went on with my life but that had triggered something and i always wanted to go walk around the world so as i moved around from the cities to the cities and all these creative jobs that are filled with liberals i always had questions certainly about their you know their liberal policies but i didn't know enough i hadn't been you know woke yet but anyway in the meantime at the age of 37 i just sold all my belongings and got my world together to in fact go live this dream to go walk around the world so that is my claim to fame i'm the first woman to go walk around the world um so i was walking and i started in vail colorado and i headed west and i went through the western u.s of course from la then i went down through new zealand up through australia and and into southeast asia singapore and in through malaysia and by now i've been on the road for two plus years when i walked into malaysia and malaysia was a game changer in my life in my political world how i saw the world and everything else i was in malaysia during september 11 2001 and i remember the day i remember exactly of course where i was i i actually was staying at this some people were putting me up at a hotel and and this is before cell phones and all this this is 2001. so uh we had internet but it wasn't as of course as big a deal as it is now but i remember i went on to cnn they had a little internet cafe in the in the um atrium of the hotel so i got onto cnn.com that night the night well it was 9 11 in malaysia but it was um early 911 in america and i just happened to notice the time in the upper left-hand corner cnn.com that's when cnn was actually reputable so uh i remember so clearly looking at all the stories and going okay well nothing of a life-changing nature has happened in the world so i can you know i always wanted to kind of keep up with what was going on in the world because i'm heading into a very muslim world and i looked in the upper left hand corner of cnn and it said 8 45 a.m september 11th and that was new york time well nothing of a world-changing event has taken place so i'll just go to bed so i go to bed i'm sleeping when all the 9 11 stuff happens and because of the time difference it was exactly 12 hours difference i wake up the next morning and all these people that were coming to walk with me without going into all the detail the lions clubs and rotary clubs would sort of pass me village to village and come walk with me and stuff like that so um they were all meeting me at this hotel and they they were saying well do you still want to walk today do you know what's going on and i'm like i don't know what you're talking about and they tried to explain to me in in their language that you know about the hijackers and they crash into the building the buildings fall down and and i couldn't understand them so i called my dad in la right there on the spot i said what is going on out there by now it's 9 11 l.a time i said what is going on so he tells me what's going on and that set my walk and my life off into a different trajectory altogether that morning so lisa do you still want to walk or do you want to um take the day off what do you want to do and i said well let's continue to walk but if you guys could help me find a place to stay tonight that has cnn and uh internet access remember it's 2001 early days of online access they said okay so we continue to walk and they do they find me a place to stay now as i look back and i look back at all this um you know when you look back and you can see all the the dot to dots and stuff like that and and uh it starts to make sense or you start to marvel at certain things i was gone for a total of five years walking around the world for five years so how many days is that it's like 1800 plus plus days right the only night ever that i stayed with a muslim family was the night of 9 11. they found a family that was a muslim family but it was muslim by default if you will okay because if you marry a muslim you have to become muslim and if if uh you give birth to someone like uh if if you were chinese and they were muslim now you're both muslim and you give birth to babies that are muslim so this was like all by default the mother was actually chinese and the man was actually tamil indian but they were muslim by default so they you know they had three grown kids and and um they had shipped them off to australia to get their education and they said these two people they greeted me into their home and they said i understand you want internet access and cnn and just get caught up and i said yeah that'd be great they said i'm so sorry but we have plans for tonight but we'll we're gonna cut it short but we're gonna just run out and um in the meantime we're just gonna plunk you here in front of cnn and we'll be right back well their mother was next to me and she was a muslim woman with the whole headdress everything so her and i couldn't talk to each other we're both sitting side by side staring at cnn trying to unravel what had happened that day and it's still 9 11 but it's 9 11 late night malaysia time and in the u.s now is september 12th so they had been living with this for 24 hours does that make sense so um they came back and i had it was really the start of a game changer in my life i sat and chatted with them again they're muslim by default right i remember so clearly sitting at their dinner table and it now seems like a really weird conversation but i want you to take yourself back to 2001 and we didn't know what we know now about islam and about how they hate america and all this stuff so i sat at this dinner table with them and i said well i don't understand how you're muslim by default why can't you just not be muslim because they were very embarrassed by their religion they didn't want to be muslim i was like well i don't get it right am i all american free to be whoever the heck you want to be kind of you know mindset i'm like why can't you just not be muslim and they were saying you can't do that you know she was you know born into it because her father was muslim and married their mother and you know all the the whole story and then so she's muslim and wanted to marry him who's a tamil indian so now he's muslim and they're explaining that no you can't just not be muslim once muslim you're always muslim and they were worried about their kids and their kids are grown and they're living in australia why are you worried about them they're in australia it's not they like they look muslim or look middle eastern and remember the first day we didn't even know what was really going on they said well we're worried about them because if they were to be asked they would have to tell the truth about that they're really muslim so i didn't get any of this and we just had this real blood conversation and uh he was saying that muslims don't drink and you know but we're bad muslims and i'm gonna drink a beer and this kind of thing so it was a real game changer because it gave me really genuine insight as to what it means when we say we live in a free country what does free mean what is freedom of religion in america freedom of religion i now know because of that whole episode freedom of religion means you don't have to be with the religion of your parents you can be born lutheran turn jewish and then get divorced and make up your own religion and be whoever you want to be in your friends will throw you a party for finding yourself and that is really almost nowhere else i mean there are other free countries in the world but there's nothing like american freedom another big game changer in that whole malaysia now just in case anyone asked you it takes two months to walk up through the south end to the north end of malaysia so i was there for two months and it happened to be through um mid august to mid-october 2001. so right in a very big game changing kind of timeline in certainly american history and world history so the lions clubs and the rotary clubs were helping me they were sort of you know passing me village to village and walking with me and etc taking really good care of me and i was doing it for breast cancer so there were there's breast cancer fundraising and advocacy work and stuff like that lots of interviews and press and things like this and the lions clubs were primarily okay well let me back up there's three major um races if you will in in malaysia there's the muslims the malays the malaysians the muslims and then the chinese which are buddhist and then the indians tamil indians okay and they're hindu so there's the three major racist religions there and i mean seriously i was like forrest gump out there there were hundreds of people walking with me every day and they were almost exclusively the chinese and the indians and what i discovered is that if you are muslim then you go down to the equivalent of the dmv and you sign something off that said yes you are a practicing muslim doesn't care if you're chinese or whatever if you are a practicing muslim then you are now malaysian and therefore you get all these different benefits in life meaning you get social um you get the social programs so um you would get your your children get free education higher education um you can own land and you can get let's say unemployment things like that right all you gotta do is go down to the dmv and i'm making that up because i don't know what it is but it's the equivalent of the dmv and you sign off and then you get all these things okay but if you don't sign off then you are not malaysian even though of you are chinese of chinese descent for years okay years decades you're still chinese you're not very different in america right you come into america you're an american so that was one weird thing okay what i also saw though is these chinese and indians that were walking with me every day all day they were hard working hard working because they didn't have any social backup they didn't have the safety nets that the malays do the muslims okay so i'm watching this and i'm watching every town we're going through by the way it's like i think it's like 60 to 70 percent malaysian race that is there and then the other 30 40 is made up of the other races and it's really that 30 to 40 percent of the chinese and the indians that are working they're the ones working and that's what i saw i mean i saw it with my own two eyeballs they're the ones working so essentially what i am watching day by day foot step by foot step talk about ground level stuff is i am seeing two societies living side by side one is a socialist country and one is free market and they were side by side who was working who was getting educated it was the chinese and the indians that were going to school and they would raise their kids and ship them off to say australia the us the uk to get educated that was a game changer to see that two societies living side by side that is malaysia and what i haven't stayed up on i don't know i haven't stayed up on the fact that um if everyone is going to raise their kids and ship them out well who is in fact going to be doing the work right if the malays in fact they're not going to be doing the work do you see what i mean so that was a big old game changer and that 11 happened during this time of course and there was that funky month between when 9 11 happened and then when the world the allies actually went to war and they went to war the day before i actually crossed from malaysia into the thai border and thailand's a different story so as i continued my walk i was not quite halfway around at that point so as i continued my next two and a half years i am watching as the world is changing and i really started to become politically woke i started reading papers and i mean podcasts didn't exist yet uh it was even difficult to get a newspaper but i would try to get them and i just started asking questions to myself and again you know i didn't there wasn't smartphones or anything yet um but i just started asking questions and looking and asking for answers and observing it was just a lot of observing too uh you're observing different cultures as you're going around you know it's like um thailand is one kind of culture it's very free market trade we have a good relationship with them then over into india different entirely um then up through turkey and europe and i'm just seeing all these changes and i really became a republican after um let me see i arrived three and a half years after i'd started i arrived back into the united states on the east coast and i had a whole new uh vision and idea and understanding of what america is what it means to the world mean it means to the history of the world why people were fighting for freedom what freedom really means i got it i got it and i started to see of course as i continued my walk like all these people that risked lives to get to america and why it's because of these systems right so they get to america and they have their freedom and they build and they build and um so then i arrive back into the u.s and i see it with fresh new eyes and i see it through the eyes of the immigrants that came in and i just started thinking you know it's certainly worth fighting for so once i got back into america and there was still another year and a half to walk from new york to colorado um but i started listening to um glenn beck um sean hannity i started listening to rush limbaugh and i just they made sense to me and i was like that's it that i get it that's where i have been frankly since i was a kid but i couldn't put a sort of a face to it and i was like wow i'm really a republican so i i finished my walk and i think my mom god love her you know she's fabulous and all but um she's liberal she's not left-wing she's liberal she's um you can have a chat with her but you know um when people when people ask her wasn't it scary to have your daughter out walking in the world by herself um she says well the scariest thing is she came back a republican but i really you know again saw the world through different eyes and i remember when i was coming back into the u.s and mom had realized i was getting so much support all around the world and she said i know you're going to be really disappointed when you get back to the u.s and you're not going to get nearly the support that you have all over the world i gotta tell i was kind of nervous about that boy and we could not have been more wrong i found americans to be among the friendliest and most hospitable and most generous people of anywhere in the world anywhere in the world the friendliest the most generous all the time people putting me up picking up my check at the diner and just you know stopping and giving me gifts people giving you like here's some bread here's a rock from the quarry and just running after me giving me gifts and i saw that i was discovering america with such completely different eyes and ready to fight so then cut to 2016 of course and i was thrilled i was on board with donald trump right away thinking you know he's a businessman if you are not looking with close eyes you think he's some kind of doofus a big orange fella and he ain't no doofus i think predict this because mark my words he is going to be a class in college in universities that people are going to study how is he 10 steps ahead of everybody else if you think he's stupid then you just keep thinking that because you know he has fooled you so i am watching and studying what he does flat out studying it because he is you you can't be a successful real estate developer in new york city and internationally without being five steps ahead ten steps ahead so one of the biggest things i learned on my walk five years is that there is always another side to the story every single time there is another side to the story so as an example one time i was walking up for two months i was walking up the east coast of australia it's just nothing but farmland and they're huge farms farmland farmland farmland and i don't remember the details except while i was walking through this area there was a big strike going on two different sides of the strike and i would stay with a family on one night and they would tell me all about their side and i was like yeah you're right i'm i'm with you how could they and i'm all ranting raven i'm on your side next day i'm staying with another family they're on the opposite side of that strike and they're telling me their side i'm like yeah you're right and i'm on your side and then every night i would hear a different side to the story and that was a game changer too there's always a different side to the story so now i know how to read the media as all of you do too otherwise you wouldn't be on this uh great walkaway campaign so now when i hear something i don't believe it like automatically don't believe it even if it's on our side i dig into it what is the real story and that's how i i listen and read and watch the news at this point but um so i started out as a walk away but now since 2001 i've been a walk away and now i'm a walk with i'm a passionate walk with i will do what it takes to get donald trump reelected i think he is you think i'm crazy you think this is an overreaction i don't think he's just saving the united states i think he's saving western civilization i really really do so that's my story i'm glad i finally did it so anyway way to go brandon and way to go team just keep it up i'm with you thanks guys,"Hey guys uh, my name is paulie letofsky and I have been following brandon and walk away. In fact, I give to him and his patreon account every month, so I've been a big fan, been watching all your videos frankly never even occurred to me to do my own. I don't know why I thought my story wasn't um dramatic enough or whatever, but he put out a plea today to post your videos and I and I promised that I would so I guess- here's my uh walk away long time ago now I'm a walk with okay. So I I was a democrat grew up in in the liberal cesspool of america. Minneapolis in the liberal family love them, but I am the black sheep and then I just thought that you know democrats were nice. People and republicans were mean. I guess that's kind of what I've been hearing all across your videos too, and that's very much my story. So as I went through my life, I lived in big cities. Now, please forgive me, but I lived in boston and I remember going out to rally for ted kennedy. Oh my god. Please forgive me, but then michael dukakis, oh it's just horrible, so I live. You would think by my bio that I would be a liberal growing up in minneapolis living in cities. I am in a creative field, which generally is liberal. I'm in the publishing world. I am a single woman. I've never been married. I don't have kids, so those are all sort of traits for being a liberal. So no one would ever guess I'm not necessarily religious, nothing like that. So a half jewish half lutherans. I got liberal written all over me, but no I mean honestly if I would have taken a test. Probably when I was six, I probably would have said you know: you're a republican, you're conservative, because I've had these same values, but I just they were misplaced. So that's what I am so I had this dream. My whole life to go walk around the world when I was 12 growing up in minneapolis. I read a story of a guy that when walked around the world and I'm like- oh, I want to go. Do that? That's how I wanted to go explore the world, but when I was 12 it was 1974 and 12, and you just 12 year old girls don't grow up and go walk around the world, so it was kind of this hidden dream of mine and I tucked it inside my head and went on with my life, but that had triggered something and I always wanted to go walk around the world. So, as I moved around from the cities to the cities and all these creative jobs that are filled with liberals, I always had questions, certainly about their. You know their liberal policies, but I didn't know enough. I hadn't been you know, woke yet, but anyway, in the meantime, at the age of 37, I just sold all my belongings and got my world together to in fact go live this dream to go: walk around the world, so that is my claim to fame, I'm the first woman to go walk around the world um. So I was walking and I started in vail colorado and I headed west and I went through the western u.s, of course, from la then I went down through new zealand up through australia and and into southeast asia, singapore and in through malaysia, and by now I've been on the road for two plus years when I walked into malaysia and malaysia was a game changer in my life in my political world, how I saw the world and everything else I was in malaysia during september, 11 2001, and I remember the day. I remember exactly, of course, where I was I I actually was staying at this. Some people were putting me up at a hotel and- and this is before cell phones and all this- this is 2001. so uh we had internet, but it wasn't as of course, as big a deal as it is now. But I remember I went on to cnn. They had a little internet cafe in the in the um atrium of the hotel, so I got onto cnn.com that night the night. Well, it was 9 11 in malaysia, but it was um early 911 in america and I just happened to notice the time in the upper left-hand corner cnn.com. That's when cnn was actually reputable, so uh. I remember so clearly, looking at all the stories and going okay. Well, nothing of a life-changing nature has happened in the world. So I can you know I always wanted to kind of keep up with what was going on in the world, because I'm heading into a very muslim world- and I looked in the upper left- hand, corner of cnn- and it said 8 45 a.m, september 11th, and that was new york time. Well, nothing of a world-changing event has taken place so I'll just go to bed. So I go to bed, I'm sleeping when all the 9 11 stuff happens and because of the time difference it was exactly 12 hours difference I wake up the next morning and all these people that were coming to walk with me without going into all the detail. The lions clubs and rotary clubs would sort of pass me village to village and come walk with me and stuff. Like that so um, they were all meeting me at this hotel and they they were saying well, do you still want to walk today? Do you know what's going on and I'm like? I don't know what you're talking about and they tried to explain to me in in their language that you know about the hijackers and they crash into the building. The buildings fall down and- and I couldn't understand them so I called my dad in la right there on the spot. I said what is going on out there by now it's 9 11 l.a time. I said what is going on, so he tells me what's going on and that set my walk and my life off into a different trajectory altogether that morning so lisa, do you still want to walk, or do you want to um take the day off? What do you want to do, and I said well, let's continue to walk, but if you guys could help me find a place to stay tonight that has cnn and uh internet access. Remember it's 2001 early days of online access, they said, okay, so we continue to walk and they do they find me a place to stay. Now. As I look back and I look back at all this um, you know when you look back and you can see all the the dot to dots and stuff like that and and uh. It starts to make sense, or you start to marvel at certain things. I was gone for a total of five years, walking around the world for five years, so how many days is that it's like 1800 plus plus days right, the only night ever that I stayed with a muslim family was the night of 9 11.. They found a family that was a muslim family, but it was muslim by default. If you will okay, because if you marry a muslim, you have to become muslim and if, if uh you give birth to someone like uh, if, if you were chinese and they were muslim, now you're, both muslim and you give birth to babies that are muslim. So this was like all by default. The mother was actually chinese and the man was actually tamil indian, but they were muslim by default, so they, you know they had three grown kids and and um. They had shipped them off to australia to get their education and they said these two people. They greeted me into their home and they said I understand you want internet access and cnn and just get caught up, and I said yeah that'd be great. They said I'm so sorry, but we have plans for tonight, but we'll we're gonna cut it short, but we're gonna just run out and um in the meantime, we're just gonna plunk you here in front of cnn and we'll be right back well. Their mother was next to me and she was a muslim woman with the whole headdress everything so her and I couldn't talk to each other, we're both sitting side by side staring at cnn, trying to unravel what had happened that day and it's still 9 11, but it's 9, 11 late night, malaysia time and in the u.s now is september 12th, so they had been living with this for 24 hours. Does that make sense? So um they came back and I had it was really the start of a game changer in my life I sat and chatted with them again they're muslim by default right. I remember so clearly sitting at their dinner table and it now seems like a really weird conversation, but I want you to take yourself back to 2001 and we didn't know what we know now about islam and about how they hate america and all this stuff. So I sat at this dinner table with them and I said: well, I don't understand how you're muslim by default. Why can't you just not be muslim because they were very embarrassed by their religion. They didn't want to be muslim. I was like well, I don't get it right. Am I all american free to be whoever the heck you want to be kind of? You know mindset, I'm like. Why can't you just not be muslim and they were saying you can't do that. You know she was. You know born into it because her father was muslim and married, their mother and you know all the the whole story and then so she's muslim and wanted to marry him who's. A tamil indian. So now he's muslim and they're explaining that no you can't just not be muslim once muslim you're, always muslim and they were worried about their kids and their kids are grown and they're living in australia. Why are you worried about them? They're in australia? It's not! They like. They look muslim or look middle eastern and remember the first day. We didn't even know what was really going on. They said well we're worried about them, because if they were to be asked they would have to tell the truth about that. They're really muslim. So I didn't get any of this and we just had this real blood conversation and uh. He was saying that muslims don't drink and you know but we're bad muslims and I'm gonna drink a beer and this kind of thing. So it was a real game changer because it gave me really genuine insight as to what it means when we say we live in a free country. What does free mean? What is freedom of religion in america, freedom of religion? I now know because of that whole episode. Freedom of religion means you don't have to be with the religion of your parents. You can be born lutheran turn, jewish and then get divorced and make up your own religion and be whoever you want to be in your friends will throw you a party for finding yourself, and that is really almost nowhere else. I mean there are other free countries in the world, but there's nothing like american freedom, another big game changer in that whole malaysia. Now just in case anyone asked you. It takes two months to walk up through the south end to the north end of malaysia. So I was there for two months and it happened to be through um, mid august to mid-october 2001., so right in a very big game, changing kind of timeline in certainly american history and world history. So the lions clubs and the rotary clubs were helping me. They were sort of you know, passing me village to village and walking with me and etc. Taking really good care of me and I was doing it for breast cancer, so there were there's breast cancer, fundraising and advocacy, work and stuff like that. Lots of interviews and press, and things like this and the lions clubs were primarily okay. Well, let me back up there's three major um races. If you will in in malaysia, there's the muslims, the malays, the malaysians, the muslims and then the chinese which are buddhist and then the indians, tamil, indians, okay and they're hindu. So there's the three major racist religions there and I mean seriously. I was like forrest gump out there. There were hundreds of people walking with me every day and they were almost exclusively the chinese and the indians. And what I discovered is that if you are muslim, then you go down to the equivalent of the dmv and you sign something off that said. Yes, you are a practicing muslim, doesn't care if you're, chinese or whatever. If you are a practicing muslim, then you are now malaysian and therefore you get all these different benefits in life, meaning you get social um. You get the social programs so um you would get your your children get free education, higher education, um, you can own land and you can get. Let's say unemployment things like that right. All you gotta do is go down to the dmv and I'm making that up, because I don't know what it is, but it's the equivalent of the dmv and you sign off, and then you get all these things. Okay, but if you don't sign off, then you are not malaysian. Even though of you are chinese of chinese descent. For years, okay years decades, you're still chinese you're, not very different in america right, you come into america, you're an american, so that was one weird thing. Okay. What I also saw, though, is these chinese and indians that were walking with me every day, all day they were hard working hard working because they didn't have any social backup. They didn't have the safety nets, that the malays do the muslims? Okay. So I'm watching this and I'm watching every town we're going through by the way it's like. I think it's like 60 to 70 percent malaysian race, that is there and then the other 30 40 is made up of the other races. And it's really that 30 to 40 percent of the chinese and the indians that are working they're, the ones working and that's what I saw I mean I saw it with my own two eyeballs they're, the ones working so essentially what I am watching day by day, foot step by foot step talk about ground level. Stuff is, I am seeing two societies living side by side. One is a socialist country and one is free market and they were side by side who was working. Who was getting educated? It was the chinese and the indians that were going to school and they would raise their kids and ship them off to say: australia, the us the uk to get educated. That was a game changer to see that two societies living side by side. That is malaysia and what I haven't stayed up on. I don't know I haven't stayed up on the fact that um, if everyone is going to raise their kids and ship them out well, who is in fact going to be doing the work right if the malays, in fact they're not going to be doing the work. Do you see what I mean so that was a big old game changer and that 11 happened during this time, of course, and there was that funky month between when 9 11 happened and then when the world, the allies actually went to war and they went to war the day before I actually crossed from malaysia into the thai border and thailand's a different story. So, as I continued my walk, I was not quite halfway around at that point. So as I continued my next two and a half years, I am watching as the world is changing and I really started to become politically woke. I started reading papers and I mean podcasts didn't exist yet uh. It was even difficult to get a newspaper, but I would try to get them and I just started asking questions to myself and again. You know I didn't there wasn't smartphones or anything yet um, but I just started asking questions and looking and asking for answers and observing. It was just a lot of observing too uh you're observing different cultures as you're going around. You know it's like um. Thailand is one kind of culture, it's very free market trade. We have a good relationship with them, then, over into india, different, entirely um, then up through turkey and europe, and I'm just seeing all these changes and I really became a republican after um. Let me see I arrived three and a half years after I'd started. I arrived back into the united states on the east coast and I had a whole new uh vision and idea and understanding of what america is. What it means to the world mean it means to the history of the world why people were fighting for freedom. What freedom really means I got it. I got it and I started to see, of course, as I continued my walk like all these people that risked lives to get to america and why it's because of these systems right so they get to america and they have their freedom and they build and they build and um. So then I arrive back into the u.s and I see it with fresh new eyes and I see it through the eyes of the immigrants that came in and I just started thinking. You know it's certainly worth fighting for. So once I got back into america and there was still another year and a half to walk from new york to colorado um. But I started listening to um glenn beck, um, sean hannity. I started listening to rush limbaugh and I just they made sense to me and I was like that's it that I get it that's where I have been frankly since I was a kid, but I couldn't put a sort of a face to it and I was like wow, I'm really a republican. So I I finished my walk and I think my mom god love her. You know she's, fabulous and all but um she's, liberal she's, not left-wing, she's, liberal, she's um. You can have a chat with her, but you know um when people when people ask her, wasn't it scary to have your daughter out walking in the world by herself um she says well, the scariest thing is she came back a republican, but I really, you know again saw the world through different eyes, and I remember when I was coming back into the u.s and mom had realized. I was getting so much support all around the world and she said I know you're going to be really disappointed when you get back to the u.s and you're not going to get nearly the support that you have all over the world. I gotta tell I was kind of nervous about that boy and we could not have been more wrong. I found americans to be among the friendliest and most hospitable and most generous people of anywhere in the world anywhere in the world, the friendliest, the most generous all the time, people putting me up. Picking up my check at the diner and just you know, stopping and giving me gifts, people giving you like: here's some bread, here's a rock from the quarry and just running after me, giving me gifts, and I saw that I was discovering america with such completely different eyes and ready to fight so then cut to 2016, of course, and I was thrilled, I was on board with donald trump right away. Thinking you know, he's a businessman if you are not looking with close eyes, you think he's some kind of doofus, a big orange fella and he ain't no doofus. I think predict this because mark my words, he is going to be a class in college in universities that people are going to study. How is he 10 steps ahead of everybody else? If you think he's stupid, then you just keep thinking that because you know he has fooled you, so I am watching and studying what he does flat out studying it, because he is you, you can't be a successful real estate developer in new york city and internationally without being five steps ahead. Ten steps ahead, so one of the biggest things I learned on my walk five years is that there is always another side to the story every single time. There is another side to the story. So as an example, one time I was walking up for two months, I was walking up the east coast of australia, it's just nothing but farmland and they're huge farms, farmland, farmland, farmland, and I don't remember the details except while I was walking through this area. There was a big strike going on two different sides of the strike and I would stay with a family on one night and they would tell me all about their side, and I was like yeah you're right, I'm I'm with you. How could they and I'm all ranting raven, I'm on your side next day, I'm staying with another family they're on the opposite side of that strike and they're telling me their side, I'm like yeah, you're right and I'm on your side and then every night. I would hear a different side to the story, and that was a game. Changer too there's always a different side to the story. So now I know how to read the media, as all of you do too. Otherwise you wouldn't be on this uh great walkaway campaign. So now, when I hear something, I don't believe it like automatically, don't believe it. Even if it's on our side, I dig into it. What is the real story and that's how I I listen and read and watch the news at this point but um, so I started out as a walk away, but now, since 2001 I've been a walk away and now I'm a walk with I'm a passionate walk with. I will do what it takes to get donald trump reelected. I think he is you think, I'm crazy. You think this is an overreaction. I don't think he's just saving the united states. I think he's saving western civilization. I really really do so. That's my story, I'm glad I finally did it so anyway way to go brandon and way to go team. Just keep it up. I'm with you thanks guys."
4,_DYYttXTjqk,well I hadn't planned on doing my walkaway video yet but here I am 40 years later at Fort Drum outside of Watertown New York when my NAT van husband and I lived here in Great Bend New York which is also outside of Fort Drum I was a liberal Democrat feminist and now 40 years later I'm here waiting for Air Force One to fly over so I can fly I can raise a sign that says god bless our president and I'm a total I'm totally on the Trump train and my life has has dramatically changed in the past 20 years I was born into a liberal family and I was a Democrat up until 20 or so years ago after I got married and started having children bit by bit my my views started to change and I didn't even realize it then in 1996 I became a born-again Christian and I began to read the Bible and a lot of things that I had privately thought kind of fell into place I had a renewed relationship with my husband our marriage improved I had a renewed love for our three children not that I didn't love them but I just saw them as God's precious gifts many things changed for me and I realized after a couple of years that I was no longer a Democrat I changed my political affiliation to Republican fast forward to the past oh I don't know maybe five six seven years and I began to realize that I was probably more leaning towards libertarian I didn't like what I saw from mainstream what I'll call mainstream Republicans rhinos publican and name only I thought you know they're just they're just the same old same old and then President or then Donald Trump put in his candidacy and I thought hmm I had thought in the back of my mind that we didn't need anymore professional politicians and he fit the bill and but I was in the closet so to speak of my support for him for a long time and then finally I was at a Republican Women's Committee luncheon and I outed myself as a trump supporter probably the only one at the table and I thought well that's it no no turning back now but even I wasn't sure you know what his chances were I follow I follow social media Facebook in particular and I began to take note of the hundreds of thousands of likes and shares that anytime he was on for the rallies that it just got big numbers and I thought wow maybe I'm maybe I'm not alone we traveled to out-of-state I live in New York State and central New York State I don't live in Manhattan or anything like that and we traveled my husband and I traveled out out to I think was Indiana on business and we were staying at our hotel and there were people there who were Trump supporters and they weren't ashamed of it and I was like wow this is kind of refreshing so anyway fast forward to the night of the election and you know every every report I thought oh you know he's he's not going to be able to make it I woke up in the morning and he had one eye I just I could not stop grinning for days and a lot of our friends and family who are conservative felt the same way it was like there's a glimmer of hope and I've only grown to have more and more respect for him he's not perfect absolutely not but that's okay he's he is one of the first politicians probably since Reagan and I didn't vote for Reagan that is actually keeping his promises his campaign promises or trying very hard to and he's got so many against him that are in powerful positions so I you know I pray for him every day I'm part of the presidential prayer team and I encourage everybody else to pray for him pray for our country but anyway it was a long time coming but that this is my walkaway moment and I'm sorry that it's kind of jittery I'm holding this this by hand outside of Fort Drum New York and god bless everyone thank you,"Well, I hadn't planned on doing my walkaway video yet, but here I am 40 years later at Fort Drum outside of Watertown New York, when my NAT van husband and I lived here in Great Bend, New York, which is also outside of Fort Drum I, was a liberal, Democrat, feminist and now 40 years later, I'm here waiting for Air Force One to fly over so I can fly. I can raise a sign that says: god bless our president and I'm, a total I'm totally on the Trump train, and my life has has dramatically changed in the past 20 years, I was born into a liberal family and I was a Democrat up until 20 or so years ago, after I got married and started having children bit by bit. My my views started to change and I didn't even realize it. Then in 1996, I became a born-again Christian and I began to read the Bible and a lot of things that I had privately thought kind of fell into place. I had a renewed relationship with my husband, our marriage, improved I had a renewed love for our three children, not that I didn't love them, but I just saw them as God's precious gifts. Many things changed for me and I realized. After a couple of years, that I was no longer a Democrat I changed my political affiliation to Republican fast forward to the past. Oh I, don't know. Maybe five six seven years and I began to realize that I was probably more leaning towards libertarian I, didn't like what I saw from mainstream, what I'll call mainstream Republicans, rhinos, publican and name only I thought you know: they're just they're, just the same old, same old and then President or then Donald Trump put in his candidacy and I thought. Hmm I had thought in the back of my mind that we didn't need anymore professional politicians and he fit the bill and but I was in the closet. So to speak of my support for him for a long time and then finally, I was at a Republican Women's Committee luncheon and I outed myself as a trump supporter, probably the only one at the table and I thought. Well, that's it! No! No turning back now, but even I wasn't sure you know what his chances were. I follow, I follow social media Facebook in particular, and I began to take note of the hundreds of thousands of likes and shares that anytime. He was on for the rallies that it just got big numbers and I thought wow, maybe I'm, maybe I'm not alone. We traveled to out-of-state I live in New, York, State and central New, York, State, I, don't live in Manhattan or anything like that, and we traveled, my husband and I traveled out out to I think was Indiana on business and we were staying at our hotel and there were people there who were Trump supporters and they weren't ashamed of it and I was like wow. This is kind of refreshing so anyway, fast forward to the night of the election, and you know every every report. I thought. Oh, you know he's he's not going to be able to make it I woke up in the morning and he had one eye. I, just I could not stop grinning for days and a lot of our friends and family, who are conservative, felt the same way. It was like there's a glimmer of hope and I've only grown to have more and more respect for him. He's not perfect. Absolutely not, but that's. Okay, he's! He is one of the first politicians, probably since Reagan and I didn't vote for Reagan. That is actually keeping his promises. His campaign promises or trying very hard to and he's got so many against him that are in powerful positions. So I, you know, I pray for him every day. I'm part of the presidential prayer team and I encourage everybody else to pray for him, pray for our country, but anyway it was a long time coming, but that this is my walkaway moment and I'm. Sorry that it's kind of jittery I'm holding this this by hand outside of Fort Drum, New, York and god bless everyone. Thank you."
5,_lO3LLF8LKc,my name is Kelly I'm from Arkansas I am NOT a Russian bot and I have already submitted a testimonial but Brandon made it quite clear that it was imperative that we start submitting videos so long story short a child of the 80s team actually born in the 70s I think my cat's gonna join in here anyway a lot of diversity in the 80s and Democratic Party seemed like the option for me when I was old enough to vote long story short the day after my 18th birthday I gave birth to my daughter who was conceived due to rape it was a very difficult time difficult situation but the worst part was the fact that I had a lot of family from up north that clashed with the family here in the South and I was constantly being hammered to have an abortion told that I was a victim that the child would be born with this dark cloud over its head and she would then become a victim and not a productive member of society because of this dark cloud that would continually follow her and I decided that I needed to find a way to break free of being a victim and separate myself from that victim mentality and I did that I chose not to have the abortion my daughter is a very productive member of society she's a wonderful wonderful mother and all-around just great person the circumstances have not affected who she has become one bit but that situation I believe is what tempted me to back up and research abortion and why it seemed to be so heavily pushed by the Democrats it's hard for me to accept that a party that championed themselves is loving and accepting of all were also champions of murder because that's what it is so I continue to educate myself and decided that the Democratic Party was no place for me not however not however soon enough because I did vote for Bill Clinton and I even defended him during the little blue dress incident convincing myself that it didn't matter because it was private yeah that's a sticky situation anyway [Music] abortion is what prompted me to look deeper into the Republican Party and the deeper I dove the more I realized that this party was not full of hate and racism it was everything but that sure you have your radicals radical Christians you have hate groups you have the KKK white supremacy you name it it's all out there but it's not defined by Republican or Democratic it's defined by hate these people just hate anything that's different I'm just not that way I'm accepting and to be a Democrat mean meant that I had to hate people that didn't agree with what my party stood for so again I was confused on how this party was the party of love and acceptance and intolerant to everything other than what they believed in I don't want to continue to drag this on and Riaan faceny single thing that I wrote in my written testimony my main point was to let you know that the Republican Party is one of the most accepting group of individuals that I've ever been a part of in my entire life I walked away a long time ago and I encourage others who are viewing this testimony or by chance read my other testimony to give it a chance if you're not ready to walk away nobody's pressuring you here nobody's wanting to force you into their beliefs or their ideals or a certain mindset but if you will look if you will research if you will educate yourselves you will find that this is not the party that we are being portrayed as on these other media outlets and Donald Trump bless him yeah he's not your typical political leader he wasn't born and raised by the Kennedys and groomed from birth to be that president that was broke straight out of a political mold from day one making sure that you have absolutely no skeletons in your closet or anything else for that matter because you can't ever make the mistake of doing anything that can be dug up on you later and ruin your political career he's just a man who made it and saw others taking it down not just for the big guy but for the little guy and everybody in between he has not had a perfect past he has skeletons in his closet but he was willing to be transparent and allow people to drag him in his family through the mud and reveal maybe some things he's not entirely proud of from his past to do what was right to make a difference to make America great again to put America first by no means am i against anyone being able to experience the freedom and the love that America has to offer but at the same time I'm broken daily by the Americans that are going hungry and homeless and without medical care here while to put on a show in my opinion you reach out to everyone else while you're America falls to the wayside I'm not the most political person in the world I don't know all of the different parts of you know politics and the houses of representatives and Congress and everything else like that I'm just a normal person that can see clearly for once and my prayer is that Trump can bring back our America to us before it's too late my

folks walking away in droves from the democratic party and you know it took a while but the fact that it did makes it that much sweeter that it's happening now because it's about damn time because

reflection of what's in their mind mandatory minimum sentencing who was that democrats uh and i was also pushed by the congressional black caucus thank you guys for that um you know the war in poverty started to break down of the black family now we have almost 75 percent of black kids born to single-parent homes and now i know that there are exceptions to every rule and every person that is raised by a single mom is not a thug criminal poor destitute but believe me the people who aren't they are exceptions and not the rule and if you have an unstable foundation whatever you build on it it's not gonna last that's why the numbers in the black community are crazy and it's all from the democratic party planned parenthood there's just over 600 000 abortions performed in this country every year half of them are from planned parenthood where do you find planned parenthood anybody anybody in the comments section please post a selfie of you in front of planned parenthood pebble beach planned parenthood beverly hills planned parenthood manhattan wherever you may be in the country please show me because that'll be the first time i've ever heard of planned parenthood in somewhere where it wasn't a bunch of poor uh colored folk coloreds uh let's see black women are about three percent of the population yet are responsible for 35 of the abortions in this country over a third since 1973 over 19 million black babies have been aborted thanks democrats your plan is working to perfection all these cities around the country where all these black bodies are stacking up all these black children are being left without their parents because you know their parents get incarcerated too this year we're looking at about 4 000 black kids who will be separated from their parents this year alone due to incarceration um let's see let me see if i can find some footage of the keep those family together march is going on this weekend oh oh no no they don't do them for us oh okay this is doing for illegal immigrants hmm the black people are from this country anyway yeah yeah [ __ ] that uh we'll just do those marches for illegal immigrants um let's see chicago almost 800 dead in one year democrats baltimore over 300 dead one year that's democrats l.a you know about l.a you've been around since snoop dogg came out you know what's going on in l.a that's democrats right there democrats don't care about black folks they don't yet they get 95 96 96 of our vote every time without the black vote obama wouldn't have been in office obama was the first black president we've ever had and probably the last two thanks barry [ __ ] but he's the first black president we have the hell did he do i'll wait need some of that jeopardy music nothing he didn't do [ __ ] the democratic party does not give a [ __ ] about black people and never has slavery jim crow kkk all that people talk about now old kkk kkk and [ __ ] compared to what they were back in the late 1800s early 1900s i think it was 1916 100 000 strong marching in front of the white house down pennsylvania avenue let 100 kkk members try to do that right now it's a wrap but back then there was something democrats who voted against uh black folks being emancipated 13th 14th amendment democrats not one democrat voted for that who voted against a civil rights bill democrats who called it the [ __ ] bill democrats who said barack obama a few years later a few years ago will be getting us coffee that's your boy bill clinton democrat who said that black men are super predators that's his girl hillary ride or die check her husband's skeeting in girls faces that's my man she's a democrat i got hot sauce in my purse i should grow hillary clinton again democrat i don't understand it the last two good democrats we had were jfk and his brother robert kennedy we saw what happened to him payal ever since then [ __ ] democrats dragging down black people in america started with the family if you don't have a solid family anything else you try to do after that ain't gonna mean [ __ ] but that's how they want it still getting our vote i don't understand it it's like you're in a relationship abusive relationship and they started kicking your ass every day but when they come home from work you got a hot plate for them every time year after year after year in all these shitty violent ass cities around the country all run by democrats for the last two years five years ten years no you're talking 40 50 60 years in the hands of democrats and black folks have been suffering at every turn but you know i think it's coming to an end i think this hashtag walk away is some real [ __ ] it's going to get some legs as they say in the business and it's time for [ __ ] to start changing because we can't wait for the democrats to do it everybody talking [ __ ] about trump and the conservatives hey i got more money in my check my board is about to get a little more secure we're respected and feared around the world again as it should be because we are the biggest baddest most well-armed [ __ ] on the block and that's just how it is that's how it's gonna be no thanks to the democrats bro obama was a [ __ ] when it came to the world stage we're laughed at he kissed the saudi prince's ring who the [ __ ] kicks kisses another man's ring if your last name in corleone you're gonna should be kissing a goddamn ring of another man that's disgusting i'll bow if that's your thing but i'm kissing a goddamn thing but a hashtag walk away it's real i'm loving it and you know for those of you who are still on the democratic plantation don't listen to everybody when you try to leave because when you try to leave the plantation they're going to send the slave catchers after you all right they come in the form of keyboard warriors members of your family friends people thought you were your friends they're gonna tell you [ __ ] they're gonna tell you that the republicans and the conservatives are racist all i'm saying is do some homework look that [ __ ] up everything i just said is a fact it's not my emotions it's not my feelings it's facts they're getting on tv literally crying about some illegal kids who shouldn't even be here in the first goddamn place but won't shed a tear for your black ass they didn't shed a tear for taishan lee that little nine-year-old boy in chicago who was shot seven [ __ ] times in his chest they didn't say nothing about that but they got that picture of that little girl in the cover time magazine that [ __ ] wasn't even real she wasn't even separated that's some [ __ ] and everybody's you know keep the families together what about the american families what about the 2 million plus kids who are separated from their family from their parents due to incarceration crickets nobody gives a [ __ ] black folks continue to wake up get your ass off that plantation that demo rat plantation and me and the rest of the black conservatives will be waiting right here or the lantern at the beginning of the tunnel to freedom get your ass over here i'm jericho green i'm out,"What's going on everyone, jericho, green, I'm back at it um today we gotta talk about hashtag walk away. Finally, yes, it is here. People are waking up and walking away in droves, namely black folks walking away in droves from the democratic party, and you know it took a while, but the fact that it did makes it that much sweeter that it's happening now, because it's about damn time, because since the beginning of american time the democrats have been against black folks in a bad way, and you know people will say no a long time ago. Democrats republicans they were differently, switched. That's man. What's the word, I'm looking for it's a compound word, [ __, ] democrats have always had it out for black folks slavery, jim crow, ku, klux, klan war on poverty war on drugs. What more do you need these politicians get out here and tell us what we want to hear, while, on the other hand, talking [, __, ] lbj lyndon baines johnson he took over after kennedy got assassinated boy that [ __ ] got a laundry list of racist, [, __ ], he said, but that's nothing. New, even at that point in the 1960s that was nothing new called the civil rights bill, the [ __ ] bill. He said after you know talking about the war on poverty. He said I'll. Have these [ __ ] voting democratic for the next 200 years. Let me tell you something: uh they're on their way: 95 96 percent of black folks vote democrat. Despite all this, despite that mindset, despite those comments like I said, lbj, you got clinton talking about barack obama. He said a few years ago. He would have been getting us coffee. You got hillary clinton with. I got hot sauce in my purse comment. The super predator comment you got like I said before joe biden. They want to put y'all back in chains while unchaining wall street all these racist comments. That is a reflection of what's, in their mind, mandatory minimum sentencing. Who was that democrats uh and I was also pushed by the congressional black caucus? Thank you guys for that um. You know the war in poverty started to break down of the black family. Now we have almost 75 percent of black kids born to single-parent homes, and now I know that there are exceptions to every rule and every person that is raised by a single mom is not a thug criminal, poor, destitute, but believe me, the people who aren't they are exceptions and not the rule, and if you have an unstable foundation, whatever you build on it, it's not gonna. Last! That's why the numbers in the black community are crazy and it's all from the democratic party planned parenthood. There's just over 600 000 abortions performed in this country every year. Half of them are from planned parenthood. Where do you find planned parenthood? Anybody! Anybody in the comments section please post a selfie of you in front of planned parenthood, pebble beach, planned parenthood, beverly hills planned parenthood, manhattan wherever you may be in the country. Please show me because that'll be the first time I've ever heard of planned parenthood in somewhere, where it wasn't a bunch of poor, uh, colored folk, coloreds uh. Let's see black women are about three percent of the population, yet are responsible for 35 of the abortions in this country. Over a third since 1973 over 19 million black babies have been aborted thanks democrats, your plan is working to perfection. All these cities around the country, where all these black bodies are stacking up. All these black children are being left without their parents, because you know their parents get incarcerated too this year, we're looking at about 4 000 black kids, who will be separated from their parents this year alone, due to incarceration um. Let's see, let me see if I can find some footage of the keep those family together march is going on this weekend. Oh, oh! No! No! They don't do them for us, oh okay! This is doing for illegal immigrants. Hmm the black people are from this country anyway, yeah yeah, [, __ ] that uh we'll just do those marches for illegal immigrants. Um, let's see chicago almost 800 dead. In one year democrats baltimore over 300 dead one year. That's democrats, l.a, you know about l.a you've been around since snoop dogg came out. You know, what's going on in l.a, that's democrats right. There democrats don't care about black folks. They don't yet they get 95 96 96 of our vote. Every time without the black vote, obama wouldn't have been in office. Obama was the first black president. We've ever had, and probably the last two thanks: barry [ __ ], but he's the first black president we have the hell. Did he do I'll? Wait need some of that jeopardy, music, nothing! He didn't do [ __ ]! The democratic party does not give a [ __ ] about black people and never has slavery. Jim crow kkk. All that people talk about now old, kkk, kkk and [ __ ], compared to what they were back in the late 1800s early 1900s. I think it was 1916 100, 000, strong, marching in front of the white house down pennsylvania avenue. Let 100 kkk members try to do that right. Now, it's a wrap, but back then there was something democrats who voted against uh black folks being emancipated 13th, 14th. Amendment democrats, not one democrat, voted for that who voted against a civil rights bill democrats who called it the [, __ ] bill democrats, who said barack obama a few years later a few years ago, will be getting us coffee. That's your boy bill clinton democrat who said that black men are super predators. That's his girl, hillary ride or die check her husband's skeeting in girls faces. That's my man she's a democrat. I got hot sauce in my purse. I should grow hillary clinton again democrat. I don't understand it. The last two good democrats we had were jfk and his brother robert kennedy. We saw what happened to him payal ever since then, [ __, ] democrats dragging down black people in america started with the family. If you don't have a solid family anything else you try to do after that. Ain't gonna mean [, __ ], but that's how they want it still getting our vote. I don't understand it. It's like you're in a relationship, abusive relationship and they started kicking your ass every day, but when they come home from work, you got a hot plate for them. Every time, year after year after year, in all these shitty violent, ass cities around the country all run by democrats for the last two years. Five years, ten years, no you're talking 40 50 60 years in the hands of democrats and black folks have been suffering at every turn. But you know, I think it's coming to an end. I think this hashtag walk away is some real [ __ ] it's going to get some legs, as they say in the business and it's time for [ __ ] to start changing, because we can't wait for the democrats to do it. Everybody talking [, __ ] about trump and the conservatives, hey. I got more money in my check. My board is about to get a little more secure, we're respected and feared around the world again as it should be, because we are the biggest baddest most well-armed, [ __ ] on the block, and that's just how it is that's how it's gonna be. No thanks to the democrats, bro obama was a [ __ ]. When it came to the world stage, we're laughed at. He kissed the saudi prince's ring who the [ __ ] kicks kisses another man's ring. If your last name in corleone you're gonna, should be kissing a goddamn ring of another man. That's disgusting, I'll bow! If that's your thing, but I'm kissing a goddamn thing, but a hashtag walk away. It's real, I'm loving it and you know for those of you who are still on the democratic plantation. Don't listen to everybody when you try to leave, because when you try to leave the plantation they're going to send the slave catchers after you all right, they come in the form of keyboard. Warriors members of your family friends, people thought you were your friends. They're gonna tell you [, __, ], they're gonna tell you that the republicans and the conservatives are racist. All I'm saying is: do some homework? Look that [ __ ] up. Everything I just said is a fact: it's not my emotions. It's not my feelings. It's facts! They're getting on tv literally crying about some illegal kids, who shouldn't even be here in the first goddamn place, but won't shed a tear for your black ass. They didn't shed a tear for taishan lee that little nine-year-old boy in chicago who was shot seven [ __ ] times in his chest. They didn't say nothing about that, but they got that picture of that. Little girl in the cover time magazine that [ __ ] wasn't even real. She wasn't even separated that's some [ __, ] and everybody's. You know, keep the families together. What about the american families? What about the 2 million plus kids, who are separated from their family from their parents due to incarceration crickets? Nobody gives a [ __ ] black folks, continue to wake up, get your ass off that plantation, that demo rat plantation and me, and the rest of the black conservatives will be waiting right here or the lantern at the beginning of the tunnel to freedom. Get your ass over here! I'm jericho, green, I'm out."
7,_rgr5Zb4w-E,well i think this will be my walk away story um it's a little bit late i know to the party because this apparently started happening soon after trump's election but i wasn't aware of it because i was living kind of my own life and silence and everything like that as much as the silent majority so this is it my name is john minker and uh i grew up democratic all my life i was surrounded by my dad as a single parent being a democrat and my mom she was also a democrat is one so i always when i came voting flew no matter who granted i only voted three times yeah three times uh for democrats my first time first year uh that i wanted to vote i couldn't because my birthday falls just after uh the election cycle and that was george bush's first term uh i bo obama both times uh the first time i actually i really agreed and really felt good about the policies his agenda but unfortunately as time progressed i realized he wasn't fulfilling the promises he was too much concerned about working with people to fulfill any of the things that he said he was going to do and then his policies started changing a lot of what he promoted seemed off to me but i still agreed because i didn't do a lot of reading i just watched cnn or pbs or whatever the mainstream media taught me i was here and so i continued to listen to that for a long time but i started to do a little bit of research i started looking at the history of the republican and the democratic party i started looking into other things what the policies have been in the past what people have been promoting and to me all i always saw about the republican party it was for the longest time was big business rich lined pockets and god all the time but of course i learned that both sides deal with religion i'm not religious myself but to me as long as religion i don't care if they're religious as long as religion doesn't control and dictate policies and they really don't a lot of what they did we have all the god and things in our american mantra but in the end it's still not our policies regardless i started when blms first happened i agreed with some of the things they have said i thought that excessive police brutality needed to end but then i looked into it more i realized that a lot of what they're touting with police brutality the people were criminals there was some excessive force but the fact of matters are still criminals not all the time there's a lot of times that they were innocents and they should be prosecuted and usually they are but the problem is is when you start looking at statistics when you start looking at things percentages and stuff things don't line up it's an agenda that you just can't go it's not any different than everybody else and so when you look at a lot of the hard left you realize there's so much hatred in vitriol they promote peace they promote the idea of equality but only if it fits their narrative they shoot down blacks that oppose their beliefs conservative blacks they shoot down mexicans that agree with the wall or anything like that the reason is because they don't fit their agenda their narrative or you have biden saying come on man you're not black if you don't vote for me or it just makes sense and so as i did more research i realized this is nonsense i believe in the equality of everybody regardless race breeds sex or any of that nonsense it doesn't matter we're all people i believe that this the individual is responsible for the individual nobody should silence somebody because we have freedom of speech in this country you may not like something that somebody says but it doesn't matter you have the right to say it so i realized that the left walked away from me the democratic party walked away from me they became too extreme in their ideology silence canceled culture you have outlets media wanting to frame everything the reality to their narrative this isn't just the cnn and everything fox news does it too i believe every mainstream media regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're on they have a bias and so you don't just read one source you don't take your information from monsters you take it from multiple sources come to your own conclusion after doing your research so i am no longer a democrat i will never consider myself a republican but i was never a democrat fully in the first place i was never republican in first place i was a moderate i was a liberal moderate and i still consider myself but as it stands right now i see no reason to vote for the democrats when they oppose the individual when they impose small businesses when they promote extreme ideologies and allow these riots to go on i live in seattle i'm planning on moving but when chas and chop happened and people got shot there was problems there yes it wasn't all violent like a lot of the right media like something but it wasn't peaceful it was very harmful to people that were living in there and were forced to deal with no services from the city and the city did nothing police were told to stand down so i could no longer agree with it and i encourage everybody to read news from all sources right left moderate doesn't matter find out as much information about a situation as possible every angle and come to your own conclusion not every black person that's killed or beaten by a cop is innocent but nor is every black that is beaten and killed by a cop also guilty that goes for whites hispanic or anything for cops cops are people they're humans they make mistakes people should be punished for mistakes that causes harm to other people that goes for both sides not just cops but regular people as well nobody should be punished for something they didn't do and nobody should be considered guilty until proven innocent should be innocent until proven guilty unfortunately our system is against that philosophy anymore and i don't know why it shouldn't be,"Well, I think this will be my walk away story. Um, it's a little bit late. I know to the party because this apparently started happening soon after trump's election, but I wasn't aware of it because I was living kind of my own life and silence and everything like that as much as the silent majority. So this is it. My name is john minker and uh. I grew up democratic all my life. I was surrounded by my dad as a single parent being a democrat and my mom. She was also a democrat is one so I always when I came voting flew no matter who granted. I only voted three times yeah three times uh for democrats, my first time first year, uh that I wanted to vote. I couldn't because my birthday falls just after uh the election cycle, and that was george bush's first term uh. I bo obama both times uh the first time I actually, I really agreed and really felt good about the policies his agenda, but unfortunately, as time progressed, I realized he wasn't fulfilling the promises. He was too much concerned about working with people to fulfill any of the things that he said he was going to do and then his policies started changing a lot of what he promoted seemed off to me, but I still agreed, because I didn't do a lot of reading. I just watched cnn or pbs or whatever the mainstream media taught me. I was here, and so I continued to listen to that for a long time, but I started to do a little bit of research. I started looking at the history of the republican and the democratic party. I started looking into other things what the policies have been in the past. What people have been promoting and to me all I always saw about the republican party. It was for the longest time was big business, rich lined pockets and god all the time. But of course I learned that both sides deal with religion, I'm not religious myself, but to me as long as religion, I don't care if they're religious as long as religion, doesn't control and dictate policies, and they really don't a lot of what they did. We have all the god and things in our american mantra, but in the end, it's still not our policies regardless, I started when blms first happened. I agreed with some of the things they have said.

They promote peace. They promote the idea of equality, but only if it fits their narrative. They shoot down blacks that oppose their beliefs, conservative, blacks. They shoot down mexicans that agree with the wall or anything like that. The reason is because they don't fit their agenda, their narrative or you have biden saying, come on man, you're, not black, if you don't vote for me or it just makes sense, and so, as I did more research, I realized this is nonsense. I believe in the equality of everybody, regardless race breeds sex or any of that nonsense. It doesn't matter we're all people. I believe that this the individual is responsible for the individual. Nobody should silence somebody, because we have freedom of speech in this country. You may not like something that somebody says, but it doesn't matter. You have the right to say it, so I realized that the left walked away from me. The democratic party walked away from me. They became too extreme in their ideology: silence, canceled culture. You have outlets media, wanting to frame everything the reality to their narrative. This isn't just the cnn and everything fox news. Does it too, I believe, every mainstream media, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're on they have a bias? And so you don't just read one source: you don't take your information from monsters, you take it from multiple sources. Come to your own conclusion, after doing your research, so I am no longer a democrat. I will never consider myself a republican, but I was never a democrat fully. In the first place I was never republican in first place. I was a moderate. I was a liberal moderate and I still consider myself, but as it stands right now, I see no reason to vote for the democrats when they oppose the individual when they impose small businesses when they promote extreme ideologies and allow these riots to go on. I live in seattle, I'm planning on moving, but when chas and chop happened and people got shot, there was problems there. Yes, it wasn't all violent like a lot of the right media like something, but it wasn't peaceful. It was very harmful to people that were living in there and were forced to deal with no services from the city and the city did nothing police were told to stand down, so I could no longer agree with it, and I encourage everybody to read news from all sources. Right. Left. Moderate doesn't matter, find out as much information about a situation as possible every angle and come to your own conclusion. Not every black person, that's killed or beaten by a cop is innocent, but nor is every black that is beaten and killed by a cop, also guilty. That goes for whites, hispanic or anything for cops. Cops are people they're humans. They make mistakes. People should be punished for mistakes that causes harm to other people. That goes for both sides, not just cops but regular people as well. Nobody should be punished for something they didn't do and nobody should be considered guilty until proven innocent should be innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately, our system is against that philosophy anymore, and I don't know why it shouldn't be."
8,_v1vntB0AhA,hello good morning how are you everybody's talking about to walk away Here I am walk away um I put a read them first a woman in the whole same my pleasure to meet you all blessings to all and these were written basically in my case and it was off I would say most of the poorest population always cares about give me the state of Puerto Rico let's pull it out we're very proud of being American citizens however some of the people in Puerto Rico that one statehood to the day don't wander fool how would I say the food compromise like for example the taxes and all that stuff however that mindset is changing so in my case I was always sympathetic with the Democratic Party 2010 a voted for Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama then in Puerto Rico 2012 I came here to the states to live again in the States and something didn't add up to me in that campaign it was Obama vs. Romney the thing is I'm evangelical and there were some things that Obama was doing that they did not add up I was like something's wrong so I didn't vote for bimbo Rican and supposedly because the Democratic Party was the party of the minorities and the people that are you know not white that's what they say so I was always sympathetic to the inner started noticing things that were happening against people that have an evangelical faith born again they are born again like myself and things started developing against what we believe in 2014 I had a dream I had a revelation in regards of Hillary Clinton that if she won the election she was coming after the evangelical church that was gonna come out through that's when I took the decision and then I started looking at primaries a star rating for platforms finally reading the platforms and all of sudden I say this under my principles these are not my values what the Democratic Party stands for is not what I believe in especially being a veteran so I jump on board into the GOP then in the primaries I started in the GOP primaries I started rooting for dogs of course but the Garza was not really a speaker so he quickly draw out then I saw Ted Cruz how he stood up against the liberal press in one of the debates in regard to how they asked Hillary questions of questions how they asked arm that the arm the GOP candidates another one and I voted for Bruce Lee the families cross weeded and I came up with a video I'm like these truths oh well you know his GOP I don't know yet home go vote and I came up with a video a lot of people have heard about Mark Taylor the fireman that is a prophet from Alabama I came upon that video and that they are whipped and I understood that God had a plan with President Trump in regards of the nation the rest ordination to what its principle it's our core values and

Basically, in my case- and it was off, I would say, most of the poorest population always cares about. Give me the state of Puerto Rico. Let's pull it out, we're very proud of being American citizens. However, some of the people in Puerto Rico that one statehood to the day don't wander fool. How would I say the food compromise like, for example, the taxes and all that stuff? However, that mindset is changing so in my case, I was always sympathetic with the Democratic Party 2010, a voted for Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama, then in Puerto, Rico 2012 I came here to the states to live again in the States and something didn't add up to me in that campaign it was Obama vs. Romney. The thing is I'm evangelical and there were some things that Obama was doing, that they did not add up. I was like something's wrong, so I didn't vote for bimbo, Rican and supposedly because the Democratic Party was the party of the minorities and the people that are, you know, not white, that's what they say so I was always sympathetic to the inner started, noticing things that were happening against people that have an evangelical faith born again. They are born again, like myself, and things started developing against what we believe in 2014 I had a dream. I had a revelation in regards of Hillary Clinton that if she won the election, she was coming after the evangelical church that was gonna come out through that's when I took the decision and then I started looking at primaries a star rating for platforms. Finally, reading the platforms and all of sudden I say this under my principles, these are not my values. What the Democratic Party stands for is not what I believe in especially being a veteran, so I jump on board into the GOP, then in the primaries I started in the GOP primaries. I started rooting for dogs, of course, but the Garza was not really a speaker, so he quickly draw out. Then I saw Ted Cruz how he stood up against the liberal press in one of the debates in regard to how they asked Hillary questions of questions, how they asked arm that the arm the GOP candidates, another one and I voted for Bruce Lee, the families cross, weeded and I came up with a video I'm like these truths. Oh well, you know his GOP I, don't know yet home go vote and I came up with a video. A lot of people have heard about Mark Taylor, the fireman that is a prophet from Alabama I, came upon that video and that they are whipped and I understood that God had a plan with President Trump in regards of the nation, the rest ordination to what its principle. It's our core values and principles, are so jump on board and now that I'm, seeing how President Trump is behaving in regards of principle, values, defending Israel standing for against abortion, standing against all the things that are believing as a born-again, Christian, I, gotta, say: I walked away in 2014 you hello good morning.

Generation Xers like me and if you're not a gen Xer let me explain to you a little bit about Gen X and maybe you'll know my mindset for the rest of this video Generation X was the late 60s to the 70s of kids that were born then and we were the first generation that our mommies went back to work we became the latchkey kids so most of your Gen Xers are pretty tough because we pretty much went from having a mom to raising ourselves so we've always kind of took the cards the way they were dealt to us sucked it up and dealt with it because we had to and so what's going on right now we don't get and I'm also speaking on my social circles of people my age we all talk about kind of what's going on we all agree on the following what's with the screaming the crying the whining the marching the hats this gender confusion drop your pants you'll figure it out the tide pod munching the Second Amendment condom snorting hey if you don't know what to do with a condom you think it goes up your nose ask somebody from gen-x we can draw your picture I want to resist everything you're a commie I want socialism I want Marxism blocking traffic we need to remove statues and work on a burn a flag kneeling during the anthem what got a problem with the police why don't you protest at the police department you know everyone's a racist everyone and Islamophobic you're a Nazi because you don't think like me globalism yeah open borders just let everybody in during the party we're gonna remove ice we don't need a Border Patrol what's with this fake feminism oh that really kills me I've worked my ass off in the construction industry and what's going on right now is not feminism just the same every day is a new hysteria hey dreamers wake up the Democrats don't want to help you if they were gonna help you they would have already done it by now the only one that wants to help you is the man sitting in that house right now wake up dreamers the alarm clocks going off if you want something

Dear Generation Z, we don't get you okay, we know you're being indoctrinated by these leftists and the schooling system. We know this I, want you to wake up and do your own research and find out what's right for you not what these people are telling you in school do what's right for you politically, dear Millennials, we know for a fact you're being indoctrinated in your colleges. We need you to wake up. Wake up. Your country needs you think for yourself for a change. Think for yourself! That's! Why you're in college to broaden your horizons, get out of that echo chamber. Do some research and wake up dear Generation X that are still with the Democrats or any of you left I mean hordes of you are running away because you see what's going on leave this cry. Fest you're better than this I know because I'm one of you, dear yuppie, Democrats this ain't, the party, you grew up with son. This is not the party of Kennedy and you know it. You see it walk away dear greatest greatest generation. This is not the party of the working man. This is not the party of the New Deal. These people don't want to do anything for you. They haven't ever. They haven't, probably in the last I'd say 50 years, I have and always will have the greatest respect for you and I speak on behalf of all Generation X. If you need help walking away, we got your back. We will help you walk away."
11,-b9zX5HJHyg,hi everyone my name is Tracy Goldstein and I wanted to take a moment and post the reason why I'm here I've been following this page since it came up and I've been reading your stories and before I began to tell you mine I want to say that I'm very very very thankful to read yours because they inspire me and because they remind me that there is hope in this world with that being said if you didn't hear my last name I am a Jewish woman living in America and it is really really scary times I have walked away from the Democratic Party twice the first time was when I was in my 30s and I received my masters of Social Work from Washington University in st. Louis I entered that program is a bleeding liberal I was a straight Democratic voter and I walked out of that program seeing the error of my ways I walked away from that program seeing the ambiguity because while I am NOT on the receiving end of oppression or the policies that create oppression I saw the energy put in by the youth and these programs that wanted to create policies that they actually thought were helping people but in reality we're keeping them codependent on a system that would them I then went about my days as an independent and Bill Clinton came around and I liked him and so I started going back to my Democratic roots and then there was president of president obama he did it with such smile he didn't with such charisma i think he literally could have served people a plate of feces and they would have been happy they would have eaten it and they would have said thank you sir give me more but being that i have a propensity for academia I looked at his domestic and foreign policy I felt that it created yet more Co dependence on a system that cripples people and I also saw his foreign policy and the detriment that it caused to our country and to our allies I am socially a very loving warm and accepting person I stand with my brothers and sisters and being an ally of the lgbtqia+ movement I believe that while I am personally pro-life I don't believe that the government should legislate a person's body but with the New Democrats we have hate which I have been on the direct end of we have a culture of people who are against building walls but if you go to their house they have walls all around them we have candidates for president that are socialists but they own seven homes and only give three percent of their earnings which is millions of dollars to people in need the Democratic Party and its leadership have become hypocrites and they want to accomplish all the things I want with your money and my money but not their own and so I'm walking away again I'm not sure where I'll end up I really don't know I just know it's not here for me anymore so I hope you welcome me as your Jewish sister in this fight and I wish you all a great weekend [Music],"Hi everyone, my name, is Tracy Goldstein and I wanted to take a moment and post the reason why I'm here I've been following this page since it came up and I've been reading your stories and before I began to tell you mine I, want to say that I'm very, very, very thankful to read yours because they inspire me and because they remind me that there is hope in this world. With that being said, if you didn't hear my last name, I am a Jewish woman living in America and it is really really scary times. I have walked away from the Democratic Party twice. The first time was when I was in my 30s and I received. My masters of Social Work from Washington University in st. Louis I entered that program is a bleeding liberal. I was a straight Democratic. Voter and I walked out of that program. Seeing the error of my ways, I walked away from that program, seeing the ambiguity because, while I am NOT on the receiving end of oppression or the policies that create oppression, I saw the energy put in by the youth and these programs that wanted to create policies that they actually thought were helping people but in reality we're keeping them codependent on a system that would them I then went about my days as an independent and Bill Clinton came around and I liked him, and so I started going back to my Democratic roots, and then there was president of president obama. He did it with such smile. He didn't with such charisma. I think he literally could have served people a plate of feces and they would have been happy. They would have eaten it and they would have said. Thank you, sir. Give me more, but being that I have a propensity for academia. I, looked at his domestic and foreign policy, I felt that it created yet more Co dependence on a system that cripples people and I also saw his foreign policy and the detriment that it caused to our country and to our allies. I am socially a very loving, warm and accepting person. I stand with my brothers and sisters and being an ally of the lgbtqia+ movement. I believe that while I am personally pro-life, I, don't believe that the government should legislate a person's body, but with the New Democrats we have hate which I have been on the direct end of. We have a culture of people who are against building walls, but if you go to their house, they have walls all around them. We have candidates for president, that are socialists, but they own seven homes and only give three percent of their earnings, which is millions of dollars to people in need. The Democratic Party and its leadership have become hypocrites and they want to accomplish all the things I want with your money and my money, but not their own and so I'm walking away again, I'm, not sure where I'll end up I really don't know. I just know it's not here for me anymore, so I hope you welcome me as your Jewish sister in this fight and I wish you all a great weekend. [Music]."
12,-ix_BaWPspU,I'd like to talk about why I support the walkaway movement and I guess I have to start by claiming I'm not a Russian but in fact this goes to a reason that I do support the walk away the left wants to claim that anyone who doesn't support every single policy they have is evil or isn't real we're Russian BOTS because we don't agree with everything they say in fact they do that to each other if they don't agree 100% with each other they're kicked out of their group they're ostracized and think about what they do to people that actually oppose them we're called fascists and Nazis and racists and anything they can make up 'men to be true it isn't true in fact we've seen lately that this is much more projection this is much more about things that they believe and that they do themselves it's not about us it's whatever that can be done to make us look like were monsters and then it comes it comes to the election and people that supported President Trump did so for a number of reasons and we're seeing him answer these these concerns of the people now we were worried about terrorism we were worried about our economy we were worried about jobs he's fixing these things they're better sometimes than have ever been in history and the people that oppose us and oppose him they just will not give any credit they still want to say that is about racism or sexism or something that morally makes us monsters so let me give you the reason or the event that really brought this home for me I play video games with a group of people and it takes six to eight to for us to be on the same team and we've played for five years or more never had a disagreement we played together two or three times per week we were people from all over the country and with men women people of different jobs different backgrounds and it was always about playing the game we had conversations that would be more of what friends do even though we have never met each other until the 2016 election then with so much vitriol coming from the media and the campaign's politics somehow became part of our video game playing and 2 out of the 8 were not Democrats we felt very differently about what was being said about us about what the real issues of this campaign were and we weren't vocal about it but when the topic would come up we wouldn't just go along with everything we would pose a question maybe there was a problem with Hillary server and her emails or maybe this Russia thing maybe it's got a few holes in it just simple questions like that they were not tolerated the next thing we hear is that the two people that weren't liberals or leftist will call them we were racists we were just every moral problem that is wrong with the country and all of a sudden that the country was a a fascist Nazi regime where Republicans and conservatives we don't change our opinions that's one thing you can criticize or compliment about us we've been the same for years and years and so is the country Donald Trump is the most consider the most liberal Republican president we've ever had and yet these people that do want to change everything about the country claim where the problem we're the ones that changed we're the ones that are all of a sudden supporting Adolf Hitler and it's just ridiculous it's all it all has to it all has to it all has to keep going with a continual lie and a continual victimization of everybody who doesn't agree the left has become a cult and it seems like the only people that can't see that are the people involved with the cult they act like it everything that every issue that comes before them seems to be listen and believe if you ask a question you're not part of us if you're not part of us you have to be evil you have to be a misogynist you have to be a racist you have to be homophobic and believe me we're not any of that stuff we never have been so this is my walkaway moment I am a real person and not a Russian bot I'm a very proud American and I just want the whole country to do well there's more than one way the country can do well so this is what I'd like to say and I hope other people start to see what's going on

13,-NS7wXmNPgo,"what's going on Facebook what's going on boys and girls everywhere around the world hey man she got tight IQ server Dave Turner man just wanted to just give my take I know there's a new movement the startings called the walk away movement and that walk away movement is actually encouraging individuals especially those who have been left in the dark and left and I left behind by the Democrat Party to move away you know it doesn't matter if you're gonna vote to the conservative movement just walk away from issues that don't look that does not help you when it comes to your community one thing about me people always ask me do I turn why did you leave the Democrat Party and you know they axe it was really tough decision you know when I was part of the Democrat Party I was actually a high ranking member of the state party I was elected and actually was in the position itself you know to make some changes and actually could have really moved ahead even easier when it comes to my political standing but the thing about it is I started seeing policies you know policies within the party that was not really affecting what skin we're not helping my community I started seeing the division within the Democrat Party I started to see how one group of individuals would actually separate themself or him another group of individuals but yet the other individuals which made up 47% which was African American we're actually the ones who are being left behind and so I tell individuals this you know why I decided to walk away I didn't walk away because I was mad because I lost an election without pissed off because I didn't like you know are certain people I just didn't like the movement I I'm a person who am a results-driven person I mean I tell people this you wouldn't hire someone then they're not doing their job if they're not doing their job what would you do you also be fired but the thing about it I started to see the same thing when it came to me is that hey these same policies and that insane promises that have been told to my community for about 50 55 years I even longer than that I had honestly really focused and actually moved away from its overall mission you know the Democrat Party straight more left individuals such as African American men it's the same policy I say historic you know we have never been us an entity that has been liked by the Democrats even if you want to go back to slavery you know black men have been were used as since bucks says the individuals who were the ones who the breeders you know and were ripped away from their families move to you know they were able did with a hit to impregnate the black woman and the black woman the reason why she's so strong honest his mother's and how she's happy to take an independent role because honestly this has been something that Democrats have done for so many years they've actually you know we were moved around to plantation to plantation just to be breeders to create brand-new labor brand-new slave labor and the thing about it is true they continued the same thing and then when after reconstruction after the Civil War you've seen black men who wanted to create families and we had more families in our communities we had our children were going to college HBCUs were created we started to see the influx of black men who wanted to be family a family oriented but the same time to you also started to seeing if you break down the black family then honestly and you divide the black woman against the black man then ultimately you know someone who's gonna step up to that role and again ultimately the black woman has been the one that's chosen more because she's emotionally she focuses strictly on a lot of social issues but black metal more fiscally conservative they're more conservative in their issue then they allow them or more religious a lot of those individuals itself are family-oriented but the thing about it is too we can't step short end of the stick even when you look at child support you know the black man knows the most likely is gonna be the one who catches the short in the stick if you start to look at our law enforcement you start to look at how the criminal justice system the three strikes laws which were created by Democrats where individuals that actually destroy our community even input and it forced us a little bit further away so the thing I start to pay attention to is when they broke down that system the Democrat parted so the black woman has been the one that's been the upstanding and the one who honestly has been the one who's kept the Democrat Party afloat honestly when it comes to me and I speak to my community I'm sorry to separate myself but ultimately the black woman was probably will probably be the last group of individuals to really leave the Democrat Party because she's honestly been the beneficiary of Democrat Party I was give me policy excuse me and this is the thing I tell people back in 1932 and when you know FDR came they started to create the New Deal programs and Welfare and Weller's you know government assistance became bill really big there was two levels of that two levels of welfare at that time welfare back in the day if you were a single white man who had a wife at home and you worked would probably be the would be the recipients of the first level of welfare and that second level of welfare actually was basically given to a single black woman and so honestly if you look at the welfare you signed those paperwork's and you obviously realize a black man cannot be present and the home you they cannot be present at the home for that black woman to receive welfare if you start to think see things like WIC and other programs like that it benefits the black woman so honestly the black woman will be the last group of individuals that would leave the Democrat plantation or all the liberal plantation or would then it comes to liberal issues when I start to see a lot of black men today you know look at Democrat partisan policies today you know now they're pushing that would rather have black men locked up then and they will let they would rather let in ms-13 that tells you a lot you know and we talk about illegal immigration that affects black men 100% 1000% honestly it affects the black community 1,000% those are gonna be the individuals who you will see it social services who live in those low-income housing at the same time to the bay there'll be the individuals who would actually work those those service jobs and honestly the contracting as well as the construction jobs for lower wages and black men who used to do it cannot find those jobs and so ultimately when I see black men today and I just tells me a little bit about New York when I was in New York there was a place again they had day laborers and individuals would go to try to find jobs in the construction agency but there was so heavily populated and flooded by illegal immigrants who would get paid pennies underneath the table because ultimately again they stuck together with their own groups and black men who one of those jobs who might have been recipients of you might have had a felony or had you know a criminal past who actually was trying to make better for them live their lives would try to come back out of there out of prison and make a better life for their child but at that time the black woman has been empowered by the US government so also me the US government has been the fathers to so many black children since the 1960's even 1932 when they started the first beginning the welfare program and some people don't realize that black folks have been have been voting majority Democrat not since 1964 it's been since 1932 and that's so because before we were majority Republican but then of course the Great Depression happened and all simply FDR came about and starts to create New Deal programs but we were split but the thing about the community is we continue to have a split and we continue to have a voice before we became direct deposit Democrats and when I start to see right now when it comes to black men black men are being overshadowed I've seen some of the great leaders that you have here who may not be liberal who are straight-up Kahoot might be moderate who understand who still have a Christian background who love God who at the same time still have their own views even here in my city you know I've seen certain lawmakers who were replaced because they did not conform to the Liberal Democrat Park policy but yet they were the most effective lawmakers that Democrats ever had because they were able to create a bipartisan type of relationship with the other party and the Democrats the Liberals did not like that they called those people traitors and they made sure that they got those people out of office and replaced him with black women Muslims individuals who you know and no disrespect I have no problem with the Muslim community but the thing about it is to these individuals were the best lawmakers that they had in this city they were the most effective lawmakers in the city but yet they got rid of those individuals because again they did not conform to the new liberal socialist party which is known as the Democrat Party again the white liberal they still love God and when they made their and when they voted they voted with their convictions and the thing about it is too for black men black men things different many people from my party I told even people in the community that the black men would be the first ones who would honestly really consider leaving the dent with the Democrat Party become independent or even become conservatives because ultimately we are more focused on fiscal issues what's in our wallets if we're able to feed our families but the problem that you start to have is an issue where again if you want to get rid of a black lawmaker or black Democrat all you have to do is run a black woman against them again the number one fans of the Democrat Party have been the black woman and again I love my black women but ultimately they have been in power they've been in power about the US government they've been the ones who held this dick they've been the ones that ultimately when the black man who might have been incarcerated tries to come back and they wonder why there's a big issue when it comes to recidivism we said it as an issue when it comes to individuals going back into jail they might have been the ones who may not who have made a mistake who might have sold drugs to buy five of their family or had an issue when they were younger but when they came back they had a felony and now they cannot get a job but then they try to come back and they say hey I want to come back home that what black woman has already signed off everything to the US government and now the US government is the new man in the house so therefore a black man cannot come into the household so ultimately I'm just telling you this for me again I'm a person who looks at facts and I look at 50 I look I looking for what it is you know if you do not hold your lawmakers in your communities accountable those people who excuse me whoo-hoo honestly represent those districts you're gonna continue to see what you see today and ultimately when it comes to black men it's also going to be you just like those former slaves did they came back and they were able to create the family without the family structure we're not gonna be anything in the black community I'm a member growing up you at least had programming such as good times they don't matter if you was that they let that down that y'all you're down on your dollar and had no money if you were in the ghettos in the hood good times you had a man and a woman in the household you have The Cosby Show which shows middle class black men black people middle and upper classic success you had a programming family matters it had a man and a wife in the household you had programs again that honestly reflected a positive household where they came to the black community but the problem is now the things that we look at and how though the Liberals have already turned us is now love and hip-hop and being a baby it's very very one is more important than creating a family and the black women have gotten to a point now that hey I don't need a man I don't need a man for nothing but ultimately it's sure because the US government is ultimately replace you and again with you looking right now this look at the last democratic you know chairman election there was a black man who ran okay sacré Ellison although I'm not a fan of Ellison his entire black caucus who had he had been a member for four years voted against him becoming the chair of the Democrat Party but the Democrats said hey we already give you a black chair we're giving you two you know you know we already had one of those we don't need those anymore and then they looked at the numbers at the last election when about eighty eight percent less than the 95 percent that voted for Barack Obama you know started to voted for a and even thirteen percent of black men voted for a trump you know you started to see hey we don't need you anymore so they put Perez in they put in Hispanic in the first Hispanic chairman of the Democratic Party and it's for a reason it's for design it's not because ultimately he was the most qualified because honestly he's an imbecile for what I see but the thing about it is they did it because ultimately they want to pull out a new group of people to replace you and that's gonna be the illegals and Hispanics if the Democrats put as much time in our communities the top ten with the highest crime rates in America which are run by Democrats every slum in America come on listen to this every slum and guilt in America is run by Democrat so how does that help you out they say they're fighting for you well honestly you must not be fighting so hard and if you can't fight hard enough for us and change the trajectory of this community then we need to get somebody else in place but the problem is you have people like Maxine Waters and people like cleaver and people are like who else Jesse Jackson al Sharpton all these people who call themselves Jews who are ultra bleep black pawns and even when it came to their last election when you had Hilary Clinton going through issues when Donald Trump made the the the the the statement what difference do you does it make Hillary Clinton called and marched out the whole and I our black caucus to make a statement against Donald Trump and ultimately if you look at it right now the leadership that you have right now and so in it because they get their marching orders from those above so ultimately black men I'm making the appeal to you and you start to see this as I'm so happy to see so many black men who are stepping up to the plate and are being free thinkers who are not afraid to say hey this is not working for my community this party has lied to us for so many years they've act like they're your friends but liberal policy ultimately is doing nothing to uplift the black community we're not following Hollywood when you start to look at the policies of the President opening up factories it's not just white people that work in those factories it's individuals at black people work in those factories black men have been the main group of individuals who tried to make a try to get back and they living for their families but the problem is is once you have a felony on your record it's hard for you to really get a good-paying job and then you try to get into the service industry but yet you've been replaced by the same illegals that the Democrats are pushing today open borders again I tell you this is all about a plan a bigger plan this plan has been enacted for years they are wanting to create a brand new voting bloc a new group of direct deposit Democrats because they start to realize that not only a population decreasing but ultimately we're starting to wake up and not giving them that boat that they want 24/7 have you ever wondered why they don't ever come into your communities only only come around during the presidential elections they don't really educate you on what these offices do and they really don't come around when it comes to those local elections this is the thing there is a agenda out there when they look at the public schools public schools are failing I'm here in Charlotte Mecklenburg when you have about 60% of the school board that has black faces but yet you still have segregated low-performing schools what it what why are you there because ultimately they get their marching orders from someone higher these are the ones that would exactly what's put in place for them to move ahead and stay in their position ultimately it's not a class struggle within our communities you know see me it's not a black and white it's a class struggle in our communities is those who are up at the top who might like me trying to keep those like me at the bottom again that's the reason why I walked away and I'm gonna tell you this right now honest another reason why I walked away is because once the Democrat Party elected a person who has white supremacist background I'm gonna keep telling you this over and over again they talk about this so-called switch there was never a switch ultimately one thing I've noticed about you know individuals in this community is different about this before they vote a party and ultimately ultimately i'ma tell you this right now those same Democrats you got to realize slave masters interact with slaves they knew how to control those slaves they had no problem being around the slaves so ultimately when it comes to today it's the same thing you haven't been free you are still underneath their party you vote the same way robert e lee d robert e lee when he walked walked in the voting booth he walked and called himself a proud Democrat and you want to rename a school because his name after robert e lee or you want to take out our statue because it's named after robert e lee but yet when you go to the voting booth you vote the same way robert e-media huh again it goes back to the ignorance of our community if you realize two of our schools they don't talk about civics they don't talk about even when it comes to your true history that past slavery you do have a history and i'm when it looks to education and we also look at the lack of upward mobility in some of these communities even here in my city charlotte it's better off you coming from somewhere else than may you for be from a person who's from here to even move up because ultimately they got you in a trap and I'll tell you this black man they've been the main one locking you up they've been the main one pushing these policies and I tell them this if that was so and even when it comes to our former president if he was so worried about the black community when you had both houses of Congress why didn't you get rid of three stripes the thing about it is two is ultimately these individuals make money people like Hillary Clinton opened up more prisons than you in NY state than any other senator the prison-industrial prison chronic complex has been run if you realize when it comes to public schools they build prisons at their with in third grade off of test scores and they move kids around even with the last administration the education system dropped four points and people don't realize that black people it's not for you honestly I want you to wake up and I acts you ask yourself this question why are you a Democrat is it because they say you're black but also why are you a Democrat ask yourself that question what have they done for you lately and when it comes to that point you after you really ought to sit back and look around you'll realize honestly you're not even a thought because ultimately they have a bigger plan the liberal agenda again like Malcolm X said and I'm sorry to make it so hard he said but black managed vote Democrat that you are disgrace to your race because ultimately the white liberal cares nothing about you again it's the slave masters they know how to control you they've been around you they are the ones who honestly you know push the Willie Lynch you know model to you they're the one who used you to talk out against another one and others another slave who was smart and intelligent we brought an idea he always used the other ones to go against him because ultimately that was his lifeline that was safety that was their safety net and they didn't want anything to disrupt that why are you what is your liver what why do you have a loyalty to a party which ultimately has nothing done nothing coming in just look around look at our schools we don't focus on education no more look at our families there's no any women in the households anymore let's really pay attention to our prison in New York City there are more black men in prison than there are black men with college degrees if you realize again wake up and when you wake up be like me it's okay no matter what they say it's okay to walk away y'all be blessed Lee everybody thank you for joining this broadcast a god bless america wake up now it's time it really is time matter of fact it's been - y'all be blessed peace","What's going on Facebook, what's going on boys and girls everywhere around the world, hey man, she got tight, IQ server, Dave Turner man just wanted to just give my take I know. There's a new movement, the startings called the walk away movement and that walk away movement is actually encouraging individuals, especially those who have been left in the dark and left and I left behind by the Democrat Party to move away. You know it doesn't matter if you're gonna vote to the conservative movement just walk away from issues that don't look that does not help you when it comes to your community. One thing about me: people always ask me, do I turn. Why did you leave the Democrat Party and you know they axe? It was really tough decision. You know when I was part of the Democrat Party I was actually a high ranking. Member of the state party, I was elected and actually was in the position itself. You know to make some changes and actually could have really moved ahead even easier when it comes to my political standing, but the thing about it is I started seeing policies. You know, policies within the party that was not really affecting what skin we're, not helping. My community I started seeing the division within the Democrat Party I started to see how one group of individuals would actually separate themself or him another group of individuals, but yet the other individuals which made up 47%, which was African American, we're actually the ones who are being left behind and so I tell individuals this. You know why I decided to walk away. I didn't walk away because I was mad because I lost an election without pissed off, because I didn't, like you know, are certain people I just didn't like the movement, I I'm, a person who am a results-driven person, I mean I. Tell people this, you wouldn't hire someone, then they're not doing their job if they're not doing their job. What would you do you also be fired, but the thing about it, I started to see the same thing when it came to me. Is that hey these same policies and that insane promises that have been told to my community for about 50 55 years I even longer than that I had honestly really focused and actually moved away from its overall mission? You know the Democrat Party straight more left individuals such as African, American men, it's the same policy, I, say historic. You know we have never been us an entity that has been liked by the Democrats. Even if you want to go back to slavery, you know black men have been were used, as since bucks says the individuals who were the ones who the breeders you know and were ripped away from their families. Move to you know they were able did with a hit to impregnate the black woman and the black woman. The reason why she's so strong, honest his mother's and how she's happy to take an independent role, because, honestly, this has been something that Democrats have done for so many years they've. Actually you know we were moved around to plantation to plantation, just to be breeders to create brand-new, labor, brand-new slave labor and the thing about it is true. They continued the same thing and then, when after reconstruction after the Civil War, you've seen black men who wanted to create families, and we had more families in our communities we had, our children were going to college HBCUs were created. We started to see the influx of black men who wanted to be family, a family oriented, but the same time to you also started to seeing. If you break down the black family, then honestly- and you divide the black woman against the black man, then ultimately, you know someone who's gonna step up to that role and again, ultimately, the black woman has been the one that's chosen more because she's emotionally she focuses strictly on a lot of social issues, but black metal, more fiscally conservative they're, more conservative in their issue. Then they allow them or more religious. A lot of those individuals itself are family-oriented, but the thing about it is too: we can't step short end of the stick. Even when you look at child support, you know the black man knows the most likely is gonna, be the one who catches the short in the stick. If you start to look at our law enforcement, you start to look at how the criminal justice system, the three strikes- laws, which were created by Democrats, where individuals that actually destroy our community even input and it forced us a little bit further away. So the thing I start to pay attention to is when they broke down that system, the Democrat parted. So the black woman has been the one that's been the upstanding and the one who honestly has been the one who's kept. The Democrat Party afloat. Honestly when it comes to me and I, speak to my community I'm, sorry to separate myself, but ultimately the black woman was probably will probably be the last group of individuals to really leave the Democrat Party, because she's honestly been the beneficiary of Democrat Party I was give me policy. Excuse me- and this is the thing I tell people back in 1932 and when you know FDR came, they started to create the New Deal programs and Welfare and Weller's. You know, government assistance became bill really big. There was two levels of that two levels of welfare at that time: welfare back in the day, if you were a single white man who had a wife at home and you worked, would probably be the would be the recipients of the first level of welfare and that second level of welfare actually was basically given to a single black woman. And so honestly, if you look at the welfare, you signed those paperwork's and you obviously realize a black man cannot be present and the home you. They cannot be present at the home for that black woman to receive welfare. If you start to think see things like WIC and other programs like that, it benefits the black woman. So, honestly, the black woman will be the last group of individuals that would leave the Democrat plantation or all the liberal plantation or would then it comes to liberal issues when I start to see a lot of black men today you know, look at Democrat, partisan policies today, you know now they're pushing that would rather have black men locked up then, and they will let they would rather let in ms-13. That tells you a lot you know, and we talk about illegal immigration that affects black men, 100% 1000%. Honestly, it affects the black community 1,000%. Those are gonna, be the individuals who you will see it. Social services who live in those low-income housing at the same time to the bay there'll, be the individuals who would actually work those those service, jobs and honestly, the contracting, as well as the construction jobs for lower wages and black men who used to do it, cannot find those jobs. And so ultimately, when I see black men today and I just tells me a little bit about New York. When I was in New York, there was a place again. They had day laborers and individuals would go to try to find jobs in the construction agency, but there was so heavily populated and flooded by illegal immigrants who would get paid pennies underneath the table because, ultimately again, they stuck together with their own groups and black men who one of those jobs who might have been recipients of you might have had a felony or had you know, a criminal past who actually was trying to make better for them live their lives, would try to come back out of there out of prison and make a better life for their child. But at that time the black woman has been empowered by the US government. So also me, the US government has been the fathers to so many black children since the 1960's, even 1932 when they started the first beginning the welfare program and some people don't realize that black folks have been have been voting majority Democrat, not since 1964 it's been since 1932, and that's so because before we were majority Republican, but then of course the Great Depression happened and all simply FDR came about and starts to create New Deal programs. But we were split, but the thing about the community is: we continue to have a split and we continue to have a voice before we became direct deposit Democrats and when I start to see right now, when it comes to black men, black men are being overshadowed I've. Seen some of the great leaders that you have here, who may not be liberal, who are straight-up Kahoot, might be moderate, who understand, who still have a Christian background, who love God, who at the same time, still have their own views. Even here in my city, you know I've seen certain lawmakers who were replaced because they did not conform to the Liberal Democrat Park policy, but yet they were the most effective lawmakers that Democrats ever had because they were able to create a bipartisan type of relationship with the other party and the Democrats. The Liberals did not like that. They called those people traitors and they made sure that they got those people out of office and replaced him with black women. Muslims individuals who you know and no disrespect I, have no problem with the Muslim community, but the thing about it is to these individuals were the best lawmakers that they had in this city. They were the most effective lawmakers in the city, but yet they got rid of those individuals, because again they did not conform to the new liberal socialist party, which is known as the Democrat Party again, the white liberal. They still love God and when they made their and when they voted, they voted with their convictions and the thing about it is too for black men, black men, things different. Many people from my party I told even people in the community that the black men would be the first ones who would honestly really consider leaving the dent with the Democrat Party, become independent or even become conservatives, because, ultimately, we are more focused on fiscal issues. What's in our wallets, if we're able to feed our families, but the problem that you start to have is an issue where again, if you want to get rid of a black lawmaker or black Democrat, all you have to do is run a black woman against them again. The number one fans of the Democrat Party have been the black woman and again I love my black women, but ultimately they have been in power. They've been in power about the US government, they've been the ones who held this dick they've been the ones that ultimately, when the black man who might have been incarcerated tries to come back and they wonder why there's a big issue when it comes to recidivism. We said it as an issue when it comes to individuals going back into jail, they might have been the ones who may not, who have made a mistake, who might have sold drugs to buy five of their family or had an issue when they were younger. But when they came back they had a felony, and now they cannot get a job. But then they try to come back and they say: hey I want to come back home that what black woman has already signed off everything to the US government, and now the US government is the new man in the house. So therefore, a black man cannot come into the household, so ultimately I'm just telling you this for me again, I'm a person who looks at facts and I. Look at 50, I, look I! Looking for what it is. You know if you do not hold your lawmakers in your communities accountable. Those people who excuse me whoo-hoo, honestly represent those districts. You're gonna continue to see what you see today and ultimately, when it comes to black men, it's also going to be you just like those former slaves did, they came back and they were able to create the family without the family structure. We're not gonna, be anything in the black community I'm a member growing up you at least had programming such as good times. They don't matter. If you was that they let that down that y'all you're down on your dollar and had no money, if you were in the ghettos, in the hood good times, you had a man and a woman in the household you have The Cosby Show, which shows middle class, black men, black people, middle and upper classic success. You had a programming family matters, it had a man and a wife in the household. You had programs again that honestly reflected a positive household where they came to the black community, but the problem is now the things that we look at and how, though the Liberals have already turned us, is now love and hip-hop and being a baby. It's very very one is more important than creating a family, and the black women have gotten to a point. Now that hey I don't need a man. I don't need a man for nothing, but ultimately it's sure because the US government is ultimately replace you and again with you looking right now. This look at the last democratic. You know chairman election. There was a black man who ran okay, sacré Ellison, although I'm not a fan of Ellison. His entire black caucus, who had he had been a member for four years, voted against him becoming the chair of the Democrat Party, but the Democrats said: hey. We already give you a black chair, we're giving you two. You know you know we already had one of those. We don't need those anymore, and then they looked at the numbers at the last election. When about eighty eight percent, less than the 95 percent that voted for Barack Obama, you know started to voted for a and even thirteen percent of black men voted for a trump. You know you started to see hey, we don't need you anymore, so they put Perez in they put in Hispanic in the first Hispanic chairman of the Democratic Party, and it's for a reason it's for design. It's not because, ultimately, he was the most qualified because honestly he's an imbecile for what I see but the thing about it is they did it because, ultimately, they want to pull out a new group of people to replace you and that's gonna, be the illegals and Hispanics. If the Democrats put as much time in our communities, the top ten with the highest crime rates in America, which are run by Democrats every slum in America, come on. Listen to this, every slum and guilt in America is run by Democrat. So how does that help you out? They say they're fighting for you. Well, honestly, you must not be fighting so hard and if you can't fight hard enough for us and change the trajectory of this community, then we need to get somebody else in place. But the problem is, you have people like Maxine Waters and people like cleaver and people are like who else Jesse, Jackson al Sharpton, all these people who call themselves Jews, who are ultra bleep black pawns and even when it came to their last election, when you had Hilary Clinton going through issues when Donald Trump made the the the the the statement, what difference do you does it make Hillary Clinton called and marched out the whole and I our black caucus to make a statement against Donald Trump? And ultimately, if you look at it right now, the leadership that you have right now and so in it because they get their marching orders from those above so ultimately, black men, I'm, making the appeal to you- and you start to see this as I'm so happy to see so many black men who are stepping up to the plate and are being free thinkers who are not afraid to say hey. This is not working for my community. This party has lied to us for so many years. They've act like they're your friends, but liberal policy ultimately is doing nothing to uplift. The black community we're not following Hollywood when you start to look at the policies of the President opening up factories. It's not just white people that work in those factories. It's individuals at black people work in those factories. Black men have been the main group of individuals who tried to make a try to get back and they living for their families. But the problem is, is once you have a felony on your record, it's hard for you to really get a good-paying job, and then you try to get into the service industry, but yet you've been replaced by the same illegals that the Democrats are pushing today open borders. Again, I tell you. This is all about a plan, a bigger plan. This plan has been enacted for years. They are wanting to create a brand new voting bloc, a new group of direct deposit Democrats, because they start to realize that not only a population decreasing but ultimately we're starting to wake up and not giving them that boat that they want 24/7. Have you ever wondered why they don't ever come into your communities only only come around during the presidential elections. They don't really educate you on what these offices do and they really don't come around when it comes to those local elections. This is the thing there is a agenda out there when they look at the public schools. Public schools are failing, I'm here in Charlotte Mecklenburg, when you have about 60% of the school board that has black faces, but yet you still have segregated low-performing schools. What it? What? Why are you there, because ultimately, they get their marching orders from someone higher. These are the ones that would exactly what's put in place for them to move ahead and stay in their position. Ultimately, it's not a class struggle within our communities. You know see me it's not a black and white. It's a class struggle in our communities is those who are up at the top. Who might like me trying to keep those like me at the bottom again. That's the reason why I walked away and I'm gonna. Tell you this right now, honest. Another reason why I walked away is because, once the Democrat Party elected a person who has white supremacist background, I'm gonna keep telling you this over and over again they talk about this so-called switch. There was never a switch. Ultimately one thing I've noticed about you know. Individuals in this community is different about this before they vote a party and ultimately, ultimately, I'ma tell you this right. Now, those same Democrats you got to realize slave masters interact with slaves. They knew how to control those slaves. They had no problem being around the slaves. So, ultimately, when it comes to today, it's the same thing. You haven't been free, you are still underneath their party. You vote the same way. Robert e lee d, robert e lee, when he walked, walked in the voting booth. He walked and called himself a proud Democrat, and you want to rename a school because his name after robert e lee or you want to take out our statue because it's named after robert e lee. But yet when you go to the voting booth, you vote the same way: robert e-media huh. Again, it goes back to the ignorance of our community. If you realize two of our schools, they don't talk about civics. They don't talk about. Even when it comes to your true history that past slavery, you do have a history and I'm when it looks to education, and we also look at the lack of upward mobility in some of these communities. Even here in my city, charlotte, it's better off you coming from somewhere else than may you for be from a person who's from here to even move up, because, ultimately they got you in a trap and I'll tell you this black man they've been the main one locking you up, they've been the main one. Pushing these policies and I tell them this. If that was so, and even when it comes to our former president, if he was so worried about the black community, when you had both houses of Congress, why didn't you get rid of three stripes? The thing about it is two: is ultimately these individuals make money. People like Hillary Clinton, opened up more prisons than you in NY state than any other senator the prison-industrial prison chronic complex has been run. If you realize, when it comes to public schools, they build prisons at their with in third grade off of test scores and they move kids around. Even with the last administration. The education system dropped four points and people don't realize that black people- it's not for you, honestly I, want you to wake up and I acts. You ask yourself this question: why are you a Democrat? Is it because they say you're black, but also? Why are you a Democrat? Ask yourself that question? What have they done for you lately and when it comes to that point, you, after you really ought to sit back and look around you'll realize honestly you're, not even a thought, because ultimately they have a bigger plan. The liberal agenda, again like Malcolm X, said and I'm sorry to make it so hard. He said, but black managed vote Democrat that you are disgrace to your race, because, ultimately, the white liberal cares nothing about you again. It's the slave masters. They know how to control you they've been around you. They are the ones who, honestly, you know, push the Willie Lynch. You know model to you, they're, the one who used you to talk out against another one and others another slave who was smart and intelligent. We brought an idea. He always used the other ones to go against him, because, ultimately, that was his lifeline. That was safety, that was their safety net and they didn't want anything to disrupt that. Why are you? What is your liver? What why do you have a loyalty to a party which ultimately has nothing done? Nothing coming in just look around look at our schools. We don't focus on education, no, more! Look at our families, there's no any women in the households anymore. Let's really pay attention to our prison in New York City, there are more black men in prison than there are black men with college degrees. If you realize again, wake up and when you wake up be like me, it's okay, no matter what they say: it's okay to walk away, y'all be blessed Lee! Everybody. Thank you for joining this broadcast, a god bless america. Wake up now, it's time. It really is time matter of fact, it's been - y'all be blessed. Peace."

I've been a democrat since I was 18. did not vote for obama or hillary did not like either one of them and the reason why I walked away was seeing how the democratic party has been back in the blm. As I call burn, loot, murder, um. I don't agree with that. My mom always taught me raisin. You know that if you broke something of somebody else's, you replaced it. If you broke your own thing, if you wanted a new one, you paid for it yourself. I see. Uh pelosi want money from the government to fix these democratic towns that have been burning up in it because they've allowed it to happen, but um yeah yeah. When I was a democrat, nobody ever called me racist or anything. To that extent, I have a family with multiple different races in them I'm firefront races. But since I left the democratic party, that's all I'm called anymore, and it just shows me that it's not the republicans who are racist, like they're, calling president trump, but the fact that is it's. The democrats who's actually the racist ones and if you don't agree with them, then you're racist, so yeah. Nobody turned me away from the democratic party, but the democratic party. Yes, as my dog, wants some attention, so all right, you guys have a good one. Stop nico! Stop."
15,-XoWP6r2cB0,okay so I've never had to walk away because I've never been a Democrat but I saw this movement and I really wanted to add my input um you know growing up I never I never was associated with either party my parents you know my parents were never you know Democrat they were never Republican they always were kind of just like in the middle their independence and that's how I was raised just to be an independent thinker and you know my beliefs don't perfectly aligned with Republicans nor did they ever perfectly aligned with Democrats so I've always kind of been more centered but up in the past couple years especially I find that I've really really even though I'm still centered and I'm slightly conservative I am completely anti left and that doesn't mean I disagree with or I hate everybody that is on the left but I hate what the left has become and what it stands for for example the first time that I really really started getting red flags going up was probably in between the time of Obama's second term and whenever Trump was against Hillary and in between that time I you know I started getting red flags like wow you know the left is really really pushing it because you know I'm okay everybody has different opinions everybody's allowed to think differently and that's okay that's you know that's the beauty of America we all have different opinions where the problem starts is whenever you start believing that your way is the only right way and anybody that disagrees with you is a Nazi is you know anti-woman is anti LGBT is you know hateful is racist that's where you know you I draw the line you know and and the big big moment for me that I really even though like I said I've been an independent forever the big moment for me that I really was like I will never ever want to associate myself with the left is Donald Trump being elected and I think it was because you know the whole time that he was up again Hilary as you all know the media was painting a different picture than what was actually happening all of these polls that they were showing that was going on during pre-election was showing there's no chance Donald Trump could win Hillary's gonna be the next president and it just was like always in your face always in your face Hillary's gonna win liberals Democrats everything was anti Donald Trump and then he won and all of my friends on my Facebook and even some of my family members instantly became hateful pure hateful I had people wish that they would see America fail just so they didn't have to see Donald Trump succeed which is like the most unamerican thing that you could possibly do but I mean I've had family cut me off people that you know they they completely anybody that I'm associated with that is on the left are some of the most judgmental people I have ever met in my life and they want to tell you that you're hateful that you're all of these terrible things and I think that's that's why Brandon's video really stuck with me is because I related even though I'm not you know I'm not a minority as far as you know I'm obviously a white female I mean that even though Democrats wouldn't tell me because I'm a female I'm automatically set back in life because I'm not a man I'm not you know I'm not a minority but I've experienced firsthand you know people you know tell me oh you have to be heartless you have to be this you have to be that because I didn't agree with democratic ideologies and I'm not I'm not at all but like that's that's where it really hit home for me is you know my problem is you know the Democrats I appreciate that everybody's entitled to their own thoughts to their own opinions but the moment you start telling people that they are bad people that there's something intrinsically wrong with them as human beings because their their views don't align with your party views then your party shouldn't exist it's wrong it's wrong if that's socialism in the making and you know I want nothing to do with that so you know I a hundred percent walk I support walk away and you know I really really hope to see other people speaking out because my facebook it's like everybody is so brave to be liberal everybody is so brave to bash Donald Trump everybody is so brave to blame every white person in this world for everything and it's just it's not right anymore and I'm sick of having conservative friends who are afraid to speak up and afraid to say you guys this is wrong you're not you're not right about everything um I have friends that are afraid to speak up because of the hate that they get because liberals are so bold you know to criticize everybody else so you know speak up don't be afraid to walk away don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in and more than anything walking away I think it needs to be pointed out that just because you walk away from the left does not mean that you have to become a Republican it doesn't mean that you have to even be fully conservative it just means that you're fed up with the crap from the left you're fed up with you know them saying that they're right they're the only right answer they know everything you know it's it's the party of Lies it's the party of deception and nobody should want a part of it nobody should want to be part of the party that victimizes you all of the time that tells you no matter what you won't succeed and wants to blame every every white person in the world for every race relation issue because it's just not true the facts are not true and more than once I've presented facts to people in an argument any kind of liberal argument any kind of democratic argument and they can't argue facts so you know just to walk away from the left does not mean that you have to go right you can stay sinner be an independent thinker and honestly that I believe is the future of the country I don't think that the future is Republicans and Democrats I think the future is gonna be goodbye two-party system everybody is gonna have a brain of their own and they're gonna think with the brain of their own and as a millennial I have hope for my generation that we're gonna do away with the two-party system because it's time that goes but hands down walk away from the left they're toxic they run on negativity they run on you know the fact that they believe that they want or they want you to believe that you cannot succeed as a woman as a gay man as a gay woman as a trans you cannot succeed you can as a black person as an immigrant anybody that's not white pretty much that you cannot succeed in this country or in this life without them to speak for you and I believe that every person in this world I don't care who you are I don't care your gender I don't care your sexual orientation I don't care any of that I believe that if you want something in life if you fight for it you will get it and you don't have to do it in a negative way so join me walk away from the left you don't even have to walk right just stay Center let's do it you okay so I've never had to walk away because I've never been a Democrat but I saw this movement and I really wanted to add my input um

Um I have friends that are afraid to speak up because of the hate that they get. Because liberals are so bold. You know to criticize everybody else, so you know speak up, don't be afraid to walk away, don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in and more than anything walking away. I think it needs to be pointed out that, just because you walk away from the left does not mean that you have to become a Republican, it doesn't mean that you have to even be fully conservative. It just means that you're fed up with the crap from the left, you're fed up with you know them saying that they're right they're, the only right answer. They know everything. You know it's it's the party of Lies, it's the party of deception and nobody should want a part of it. Nobody should want to be part of the party that victimizes you all of the time. That tells you no matter what you won't succeed and wants to blame every every white person in the world for every race relation issue, because it's just not true the facts are not true and more than once, I've presented facts to people in an argument. Any kind of liberal argument, any kind of democratic argument- and they can't argue facts so you know just to walk away from the left- does not mean that you have to go right. You can stay sinner, be an independent thinker and honestly, that I believe is the future of the country. I. Don't think that the future is Republicans and Democrats I think the future is gonna, be goodbye, two-party system, everybody is gonna, have a brain of their own and they're gonna. Think with the brain of their own and as a millennial. I have hope for my generation that we're gonna do away with the two-party system, because it's time that goes but hands down, walk away from the left, they're toxic, they run on negativity they run on. You know the fact that they believe that they want, or they want you to believe that you cannot succeed as a woman as a gay man as a gay woman as a trans, you cannot succeed, you can as a black person as an immigrant anybody, that's not white, pretty much that you cannot succeed in this country or in this life without them to speak, for you and I believe that every person in this world I don't care who you are I, don't care your gender I, don't care your sexual orientation I, don't care any of that. I believe that if you want something in life, if you fight for it, you will get it and you don't have to do it in a negative way. So join me walk away from the left. You don't even have to walk right, just stay Center. Let's do it! You."
16,0_zyyP971tE,"hi my name is Donna and this is my walk away video and I think I'm really more of a walk with but I'll tell you when I walked away first I want to say Brandon you're amazing and I pray for you and I thank God for you and I so admire your courage and the the the fight that you're in is so vital to the survival of this nation so I just come into and I want to come into everybody who's had the courage to make a walk away video and the other day I was watching them again cuz whenever I start to get down and I stumble upon the nonsense the absolute disinformation and propaganda that I see on Facebook and I start to get discouraged and lose hope I'll have to go and watch them walk away videos I'm like okay not everybody has lost their mind there are there is still some people paying attention and so you really encourage me and motivate me and keep me going and it finally occurred to me you know Donna the only reason you haven't made a walkaway video is because you're a coward and you've got 5,000 Facebook friends and you don't want to lose them because I kind of make my living online and I thought point that's really shallow so I'm gonna do my walk away video my story is that I was raised in an Irish Catholic Democratic family and that's like all one-word Irish Catholic Democrat we my dad was a truck driver my dad my my brothers my uncles all of my male relatives they were all union workers a lot of them were carpenters truck drivers so if you were Union a you were Democrat if you were Union you were Democrat I remember in our hallway growing up we had a crucifix and then on either side we had Jesus and John F Kennedy and both of them were bedecked with palm fronds from Palm Friday I mean Palm Sunday because in in our world they were pretty much on par you know you had Jesus and you have Jonathan so we were the original identity politics people we were so excited that someone like us an Irish Catholic made it to the presidency so I understood why the african-american community was so excited about Obama does it Wow someone in the White House who is like us and I took we I totally get it we were identity politics before there was a term for it and so that was kind of my world and I'm I'm almost 60 so I remember Jimmy Carter I remember the malaise I remember the hopelessness it was like the air we breathed was despair and if you ever want to get a sense of it there's a fantastic movie it's called invincible with mark world wall birth and it's a true story about a bartender in South Philly who tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and spoiler alert yeah he makes the team they wouldn't have made a movie if he didn't but anyway it's set in that time period when Carter was in power and you just sense the abject despair in the country and that's what I grew up with with a Democrat in power the other movie that you can watch to really get a sense of what it was is is miracle about the 1980 hockey team because you know it's set than all the training in the background is the 1970s but anyway be that as it may just complete hopelessness but we were all Democrats and then Ronald Reagan came along and I can remember watching his speech at the Republican National Convention and I was spellbound absolutely spellbound and I think at that moment I walked away and I watched one man restore nation the transformation in the mindset and that that's really what it is it's a mindset was just phenomenal and now of course I'm a mother and I have two children and I've lived through at least six ten years of completely failed presidencies I mean W it was a complete and abject failure as a president all the wars and and madness and nonsense and then eight years of Obama completely failed presidency so sixteen years and my my kids are twenty eight twenty two and I thought you know they're never going to see a successful president say and then Trump came along and just I think he's gonna tear it up but the opposition against him is just so so incredible but anyway what I wanted to say is when I made the decision to become a Republican and I walked away back in 1980 there was so much flak in my family I mean I just could not believe that I was doing this but the funniest thing is now I'll go to like on Facebook I'll go to like Breitbart or Fox News or the president's page and I'll see my family members thumbs-up thing yeah they've all walked away they I'm not all that I don't know if all of them but a lot of them have and I'm amazed like Union guys truck drivers they're walking away too so that's kind of my walk away story I just want to say one more thing on on a personal note what really really infuriates me is how lightly people throw away the term racism as a way to shut someone up and I just want to give a really a personal story and then what I know from the frontline my daughter who's now 22 is the most like solid stable onion moat she's not emotional she plays things kind of close to the vest just a real steady steady young lady I mean she was working at a gym in the nursery you know people are working out she's watching their kids and I get a call from her and she was absolutely hysterical I have never heard her that hysterical in my entire life and she just said mom something happen at work please pray for me I thought she'd been raped that's how hysterical she was and I she came home and I'm like I myself I'm like what happened said mom there was a couple and they accused me of being a racist they went to my boss and they said that I I didn't pay enough attention to their you know to their african-american child that I was paying to the other children just like I love all the children equally I literally had been holding him half the time and it just set him down and they said that I was a racist she said there's a worst thing anyone has ever said in my entire life and to this day she will tell you the worst thing that anyone has ever done to her was accusing her of being a racist and I think most people feel that way like she's like how how can I take my heart out and show them that it's not in there she's crushed and and the duck has Olear manner that people throw around that word just to shot each other up is despicable to me I can't even put it in into words and again I'm old enough she I have seen some some really bad times in this country and I think anyone with a with a pulse and a drop of integrity and conscience knows that this country's had a big problem with it there really was a history of great evil in slavery and to be thrown in with with that level of evil so cavalierly I just Wow it's incredible and I find it infuriating and I that's why I'm really excited to see the diversity in this movement I think it's really important and then the last thing that I want to say and is that I work with Hispanic I'm not Hispanic I'm as I told you I'm Irish but I work for Hispanic International Ministries and it's based in Bogota Colombia so most of my work is in Colombia but I work all over for 15 years I've worked all over Central America and Latin America Central America and South America and I was just in Guatemala and I literally followed the path from the border of Honduras straight through Guatemala to Mexico and that was with I work with nonprofits and I work with churches and pastors and we followed the exact path and I was with a pastor and I said so tell me about this I mean I know what it is since who tell me firsthand firsthand you were right in the path of this what was this Caravan all about he said Donna these are the most vile violent vicious evil people you can imagine they left a trail of wreckage in their wake robberies rapes massive destruction he said what they do is they get the women and the children then they use them as props and I was working specifically with an NGO that does a lot of rescue work child rescue work it's an incredible organization in fact I'm going back to Guatemala with them in a couple months if you want to come with me let me know and I was talking to one of the rescuers and I said so how serious is is the sex trafficking of young women he said non-existent I'm like what you said yeah no young women here are perfectly safe all of the trafficking now is children so when they say hey all you need to get across the border free to these evil evil traffickers all you need is a child in tow do you know what they do they create a market for children and so now all the children are being not all the children but thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of children in Central America especially but Latin America around the world they're being kidnapped they're being bought they're being sold they're being sexually exploited because they're a free ticket you want to know why 600 children have not been picked up by their parents at the detention centers because they were parted from their parents so long before that journey began and you know to have some I have people on Facebook this one guy just last week called me we ready racist I mean I go I'm like I went that do you speak banished because I'm pretty fluent and I spent a lot of my time last year three months in Costa Rica a month in Brazil two weeks in Guatemala I spent a lot of time in Latin America and so I can tell you firsthand firsthand that people who speak Spanish are more than capable of coming to a proper point of entry and presenting the documentation and it's actually racist to imply that they can't because they absolutely again the people sneaking through beware because they're very very dangerous and so I think again to see this movement to see blacks it to see now I guess it's LexA the the Latino accent it just really gives me hope and I wanted to go ahead and put my face out there and say I believe in what you're doing Brandon I I want to come into all of you and this ended up being longer than I thought it would but I'm so happy to see many other people walking away I walked away decades ago and I've never looked back no regrets god bless all of you [Music]","Hi, my name is Donna, and this is my walk away. Video and I think I'm really more of a walk with, but I'll tell you when I walked away. First I want to say Brandon, you're, amazing and I pray for you and I thank God for you and I so admire your courage and the the the fight that you're in is so vital to the survival of this nation. So I just come into and I want to come into. Everybody who's had the courage to make a walk away. Video and the other day I was watching them again cuz whenever I start to get down and I stumble upon the nonsense. The absolute disinformation and propaganda that I see on Facebook and I start to get discouraged and lose hope. I'll have to go and watch them walk away. Videos I'm like okay, not everybody, has lost their mind. There are. There is still some people paying attention, and so you really encourage me and motivate me and keep me going and it finally occurred to me. You know Donna. The only reason you haven't made a walkaway video is because you're, a coward and you've got 5,000 Facebook friends and you don't want to lose them because I kind of make my living online and I thought point. That's really shallow. So I'm gonna do my walk away video. My story is that I was raised in an Irish, Catholic, Democratic family and that's like all one-word Irish Catholic Democrat.

We were so excited that someone like us, an Irish Catholic, made it to the presidency, so I understood why the african-american community was so excited about Obama. Does it Wow someone in the White House who is like us and I, took we I totally get it. We were identity politics before there was a term for it, and so that was kind of my world and I'm I'm, almost 60, so I, remember, Jimmy, Carter I. Remember the malaise. I, remember the hopelessness.

Thumbs-Up thing: yeah they've all walked away. They I'm, not all that I, don't know if all of them, but a lot of them have and I'm amazed like Union guys truck drivers, they're walking away too. So that's kind of my walk away story. I just want to say one more thing on on a personal note, what really really infuriates me is how lightly people throw away the term racism as a way to shut someone up and I just want to give a really a personal story, and then what I know from the frontline my daughter who's now 22 is the most like solid, stable, onion, moat she's, not emotional.

He said what they do is they get the women and the children, then they use them as props and I was working specifically with an NGO that does a lot of rescue work.

17,0b6vbk0JwwQ,hey guys from the walkway movement nice to meet you I'm really had I'm really happy to hear about this movement I didn't know that it was going on found him on YouTube and I feel like I'm not alone anymore so thank you this is Harley she's also a walk away her Harley can you can you hear your head upset she's very tired dog so you know say I walked away too I ran away she runs cuz she's great so it's cool um yeah my walk away moment happened about a year and a half ago - two years ago Donald came down the escalator he said he was gonna run for president it was totally nuts totally crazy uh about a few days later my mom called me just to say hi and she mentioned him and just a thing did you see that Donald Trump he's fantastic he says it like it is - two packs a day with this woman - next he says don't like it is he's fantastic I love him I think I should tune in you gotta find out what's going on you don't know anything you better tune in I know what's going on right so I thought you need a psychiatrist I was like ready to help you know I was gonna get her somebody send up to her house whatever be some house call action anyway um later that week a friend of mine called we were talking on the phone and she said about the same thing she said the same thing he knew it was he said it like it was he he he knew more of what was going on the pulse of the people blah blah blah I thought these people were crazy but I said I got to find out for myself what's going on so I just started reading and that's what I did I've read everything on the internet I read everything from the New York Times to Washington Post the New York Post to CNN to Fox News to The Daily wire anything I could get my hands on and yeah I was really disappointed in the Democrats very disappointed I was very disappointed that they didn't have an answer for this man who was running and was freaking them out and was getting a lot of attention and and they didn't have any answer nothing I kept thinking each day I said well tomorrow they're gonna come out with an announcement they're gonna have a great idea the next day the next day no answers you know it just kept going on with their same old non message but the day that I walked away was the day that Mitt Romney got on TV I was during the day it was during a work day like a Friday and he got on TV and basically told the American people that you know Donald was dangerous and not to vote for him and basically just tried to tell all of us what to do you know like we didn't know what to do on our own we couldn't think for ourselves so he was gonna help us even though he had been someone who took Trump's money for a long time you know for this that he could run and they were friends he'd spent time of this you know condo or house or whatever it is in Trump Tower and it was just terrible it was just really it was it was a low point I thought for the Democrats and for politics in general that day so that was the day I walked away it's that these people are embarrassing I'm embarrassed for them never going back and Hillary you know she had lost me a long time ago she lost me of lately Monica Lewinsky like she was she was really not a nice person when it came to the women who her husband was cheating on her with and I thought that was really low she was gonna be our first woman president and she wasn't such a such a positive woman role model for me I thought her throwing these women under the bus you know calling them names you know vilifying them I just I thought it was terrible so anyway she lost me a long time ago maybe even at Hot Sauce in her bag I remember that comment that was she's so disingenuous um so yeah walked away and I have no problems ever since I'm very proud and very happy to support the Republican Party right now and until the the Democrats come back from where they are and actually redeem themselves you know I will be with the Republicans the Democrats just they that the election is over and they still a year and a half later they still haven't moved on they still haven't you know come up with an identity for themselves and a plan for themselves that makes any sense so that's my story I'm really happy to see all the other videos like I said I look at them all the time and I hope you look at this one too and just you know find this inspirational so that YouTube could say I'm walking away you,"Hey guys from the walkway movement nice to meet, you I'm really had I'm really happy to hear about this movement. I didn't know that it was going on found him on YouTube and I feel like I'm, not alone anymore. So thank you. This is Harley she's. Also a walk away. Her Harley. Can you? Can you hear your head upset, she's, very tired dog, so you know say: I walked away too I ran away. She runs cuz she's great, so it's cool, um yeah. My walk away moment happened about a year and a half ago, -. Two years ago, Donald came down the escalator. He said he was gonna run for president. It was totally nuts totally crazy uh about a few days later, my mom called me just to say hi, and she mentioned him and just a thing. Did you see that Donald Trump he's fantastic? He says it like. It is - two packs a day with this woman - next he says, don't like it is he's fantastic, I, love him I think I should tune in you, gotta find out. What's going on, you don't know anything you better tune in I know. What's going on right, so I thought you need a psychiatrist. I was like ready to help. You know. I was gonna, get her. Somebody send up to her house, whatever be some house call action anyway, um later that week a friend of mine called we were talking on the phone and she said about the same thing. She said the same thing he knew it was. He said it like it was he he he knew more of what was going on the pulse of the people, blah blah blah I thought these people were crazy, but I said I got to find out for myself. What's going on so I just started reading and that's what I did I've read everything on the internet, I read everything from the New York Times to Washington Post, the New York Post, to CNN, to Fox News to The Daily wire. Anything I could get my hands on and yeah I was really disappointed in the Democrats. Very disappointed. I was very disappointed that they didn't have an answer for this man who was running and was freaking them out and was getting a lot of attention and, and they didn't have any answer- nothing I kept thinking each day, I said well tomorrow, they're gonna come out with an announcement. They're gonna have a great idea the next day, the next day, no answers. You know it just kept going on with their same old non message, but the day that I walked away was the day that Mitt Romney got on TV I was during the day. It was during a work day like a Friday, and he got on TV and basically told the American people that you know Donald was dangerous and not to vote for him and basically just tried to tell all of us what to do. You know like we didn't know what to do on our own. We couldn't think for ourselves, so he was gonna help us, even though he had been someone who took Trump's money for a long time. You know for this that he could run and they were friends. He'd spent time of this. You know condo or house or whatever it is in Trump Tower, and it was just terrible. It was just really it was. It was a low point, I thought for the Democrats and for politics in general that day, so that was the day. I walked away. It's that these people are embarrassing, I'm embarrassed for them, never going back and Hillary. You know she had lost me a long time ago. She lost me of lately Monica Lewinsky like she was. She was really not a nice person when it came to the women who her husband was cheating on her with and I thought that was really low. She was gonna, be our first woman president and she wasn't such a such a positive woman role model. For me, I thought her throwing these women under the bus. You know calling them names, you know vilifying them. I, just I thought it was terrible. So anyway, she lost me a long time ago, maybe even at Hot Sauce in her bag. I. Remember that comment that was she's, so disingenuous um, so yeah walked away and I have no problems ever since I'm very proud and very happy to support the Republican Party right now and until the the Democrats come back from where they are and actually redeem themselves. You know I will be with the Republicans, the Democrats just they that the election is over and they still a year and a half later they still haven't moved on. They still haven't. You know, come up with an identity for themselves and a plan for themselves. That makes any sense. So that's my story. I'm really happy to see all the other videos like I said: I, look at them all the time and I hope you look at this one too, and just you know find this inspirational so that YouTube could say I'm walking away you."
18,0h__rw_tkrA,hello my name is Dan Chavez I am a resident of the city of Oxnard in California Southern California to be exact located in Ventura County one of the things that I wanted to take this opportunity and pretty much share my story of the walk away back in 2016 I walked away growing up I was always pretty much taught that the Democrat Party is for the minorities and the poor well I am one the oldest of four boys and came from a single-parent household my mother working two three minimum-wage jobs and my brothers and I we still saw her struggling I remember seeing her face so many times when she would walk out from you know government assistance buildings to try to get support to help you know buy food or whatever and them telling her all the time you made too much yet if she tried to go get a car or a house she didn't make enough again it was always taught to me that you had to be rich and white to be Republican and minorities and those that were poor or Democrats and I believe that so much because in school it was implanted into so much so when I turned 18 I registered as a Democrat I followed the Democrat rules to always vote for a Democrat and even if the person wasn't the best choice that's who I still voted for it wasn't until 2016 in my community when I ran for City Council that I met candidates that were running for different offices throughout the state of California and there was a couple of them that I met that were Republican and I was really impressed by how they wanted to make a change in the community was the exact same change that I wanted to make when I ran for City Council I ran on a very simple promise to the residents protect our families our community and our future simple as that so in 2016 I met these amazing candidates started to learn more about the Republican Party and where it all started and and what it stood for and in December of 2016 I registered as a Republican not because of who the president was was because a simple simply that what the Republican Party represented was something that I believed in I believed in public safety I believe in working hard to get things in life I believe and not depending on anybody what the Democrat Party does is the opposite of that I couldn't support a party any longer that wanted to enable people or allow criminals to run wild in the state of California it's sad that there are so many laws that gives more rights more protections to criminals than to law-abiding residents every day a few years ago we had a be 109 pass by Governor Brown that released hundreds and thousands of inmates then Prop 47 came early release proud 57 changed the way our justice system was who got tried as an adult who got tried as a minor and so forth and then recently the state assembly just passed SB 10 which is what they consider bail reform but it actually has non-monetary bail that a bureaucrat and a computer system gets a determined on who is safe to be back in the public and who isn't there's a lot that needs to be changed and it's not about parties it's about what your heart would you're mine and what your soul wants to believe I believe that one day we would have a nation that is safe and the a nation that respects each other a nation that encourages those to work hard for what they want in life and not enable I don't know if this is the way that we're supposed to do these stories or our testimonies but I'm pretty sure somebody would tell me if I did it wrong I walked away and you can't do hello my name is Dan Chavez I am a resident of the city of Oxnard in California Southern California to be exact located in Ventura County one of the things that I wanted to take this opportunity and pretty much share my story of the walk away back in 2016 I walked away growing up I was always pretty much taught that the Democrat Party is for the minorities and the poor well I am one the oldest of four boys and came from a single-parent household my mother working two three minimum-wage jobs and my brothers and I we still saw her struggling I remember seeing her face so many times when she would walk out from you know government assistance buildings to try to get support to help you know buy food or whatever and them telling her all the time you made too much yet if she tried to go get a car or a house she didn't make enough again it was always taught to me that you had to be rich and white to be Republican and minorities and those that were poor or Democrats and I believe that so much because in school it was implanted into so much so when I turned 18 I registered as a Democrat I followed the Democrat rules to always vote for a Democrat and even if the person wasn't the best choice that's who I still voted for it wasn't until 2016 in my community when I ran for City Council that I met candidates that were running for different offices throughout the state of California and there was a couple of them that I met that were Republican and I was really impressed by how they wanted to make a change in the community was the exact same change that I wanted to make when I ran for City Council I ran on a very simple promise to the residents protect our families our community and our future simple as that so in 2016 I met these amazing candidates started to learn more about the Republican Party and where it all started and and what it stood for and in December of 2016 I registered as a Republican not because of who the president was was because a simple simply that what the Republican Party represented was something that I believed in I believed in public safety I believe in working hard to get things in life I believe and not depending on anybody what the Democrat Party does is the opposite of that I couldn't support a party any longer that wanted to enable people or allow criminals to run wild in the state of California it's sad that there are so many laws that gives more rights more protections to criminals than to law-abiding residents every day a few years ago we had a be 109 pass by Governor Brown that released hundreds and thousands of inmates then Prop 47 came early release proud 57 changed the way our justice system was who got tried as an adult who got tried as a minor and so forth and then recently the state assembly just passed SB 10 which is what they consider bail reform but it actually has non-monetary bail that a bureaucrat and a computer system gets a determined on who is safe to be back in the public and who isn't there's a lot that needs to be changed and it's not about parties it's about what your heart would you're mine and what your soul wants to believe I believe that one day we would have a nation that is safe and the a nation that respects each other a nation that encourages those to work hard for what they want in life and not enable I don't know if this is the way that we're supposed to do these stories or our testimonies but I'm pretty sure somebody would tell me if I did it wrong I walked away and you can't do,"Hello, my name is Dan Chavez I am a resident of the city of Oxnard in California Southern California, to be exact located in

19,0KmmY1Go__c,okay I had to make a video about this because everybody is still upset about the election and people keep asking me who did I vote for well I'm a Republican and I don't tow the party line on everything but I tell you point blank and playing I am not afraid to admit or share with the world that I was proud to vote for Donald J Trump and I'm gonna tell you why man because I am so sick and tired of the same old politicians promising the same thing every four to eight years this same cycle and guess what nothing nothing changes nothing they get comfortable with the power to get comfortable with a position and they get a nice effect on the success of not doing a damn thing now before y'all get butthurt about this I was also very adamant and proud of voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and that is not a slight against John McCain you know he he served our country and he was a PLW and to me he is still an American Hero okay but you can't fight history and Obama is gonna be President period the country moved to the left okay they got upset with Bush and I don't agree with everything Bush did and also I mean I disagree with a lot of things that President Bush did and the country spoke and this is a democracy ladies and gentlemen and when President Obama blew John McCain out there was no riots there was no property being destroyed yes it was some words being tossed back and forth on both sides and to me that shame on both sides but that's how democracy works somebody's gonna win and somebody's gonna lose but to the victor goes the spoils and you are responsible for the direction of this country for the next four years that's the cycle and then if you don't do a good job you get booted out of here that's how democracy works and it's 2012 when Mitt Romney ran against Barack Obama Barack Obama won the country went left in its state left and it did not like Mitt Romney's policies or how he presented himself everybody had their own reason or why he did not like Mitt Romney and Mitt Romney is not an evil person he's not he just played in the game of politics and he lost it is what it is now fast-forward to one of the single most unique elections in history you got a man who had absolutely no political experience against the woman who has had 30 years of political experience now sometimes experience can be a very very good thing because it shows wisdom and being trialed through fire you go through things and you build that leadership that character comes and you're able to help people and you're able to move the country forward from your experience also experience can be a very bad thing because if you've been doing something long enough and not enough people have seen any kind of positive movement or any kind of positive improvement even though you've been getting millions and millions of dollars something's wrong now this isn't sets ISM this isn't racism because both candidates were white both you know white well he's orange but you got a white man and you got a white woman one is 69 years old one is 70 years old so ray sysm was not an issue no other racist comments from supporters on both sides being tossed around like bad word tenants yeah it's shameful and all of you should be ashamed of yourselves and it's wrong whether you're on the left or on the right bigotry prejudice racism sexism feminism all the isms is wrong period and you do not represent me and you do not represent the majority of the country of people that honestly just want the country to go in a different direction and feel that maybe Hillary just was not the answer now there will be a woman president I honestly believe there will be a woman president within the next sixteen to twenty years it goes by really really quickly there will be but that first woman president is gonna have the respect of the majority of the country and that is how democracy works and people want to get rid of the electoral college well you know some of the electoral college was invented to keep mob ruled from ruling the country now if you don't understand that go and take your civics classes in college or you got some in high school on the importance of the electoral college and firm balanced representation of the entire country you'll be fascinated by what you learn in those classes and about how the country really works and about how the democratic process of voting in a president works so for everybody that's upset because you can't get lost well guess what before the end of your lifetime nine times out of ten more and more of your candidates are going to lose and more and more of your candidates before your lifetime are going to win now you win with grace you you don't have to hold the losers hands because the victor to the victor go the spoils but two people that lose the best thing you could possibly do instead of burn and stuff down instead of destroying your communities or the communities of others as your bust in build not only build but build a massive coalition and convince people through evidence and facts of why your point of view is superior then your opponent's point of view and why your direction of the country is better than the other that's how democracy works to say that Donald Trump is going to destroy America while you're destroying America is an oxymoron it's hypocritical I know you're angry I know you're hurt but if I was mad at you and you pissed me off and I said you know something I want to break the law and I want to come to your house and I want to tear up your stuff because I'm mad at what you said you would say why G night storm you need to get control of your emotions brother and this is irresponsible behavior and how in the world you you think you can convince me of the words that you are speaking because your actions are screaming louder than any words that ever come out of your mouth you are destroying my country you're destroying my home you're destroying my job or how I'm able to take care of people and my family and my children if you want to convince me didn't convince me show me through your policies through your actions then listen to your words so on that note I want to say God bless this country and I wish Donald Trump the very best for the job that he has because it's never done this before he's need a lot of help but it is our duty as Americans to pull behind a president regardless if it's a Democrat or if it's a Republican respect the office and I know so many so many liberals say well Obama was not respected in the presidential office and he wasn't it is the truth and it is shameful and I will say this one more time bigots on both sides whether you have a are in front of your name or D in front of your name if you cannot respect the office of the president then you have no business voting for president and you have no business running for president so period you can agree to disagree agree to disagree but by the end of the day when Donald Trump is in that White House and President Obama was sitting next to him both men put aside all the BS and the rhetoric of the campaign and put the country first both men had nothing but respect for each other and dynatrap had respect for President Obama and President Obama had respect for president elect Donald Trump because that's democracy that that's how you get the job done that is what America is about we will fight but we will respect each other move forward and get on with the business of governing our great country so god bless you god bless Republicans god bless Democrats god bless liberals god bless conservatives god bless independence and god bless everybody that hears my voice I love you you're my brothers and you're my sisters let's make this country great because the president regardless of who it is does not make the country great it is me and it is you that makes this country great so halogen later and I look forward to reading the comments on this video god

The March and the brunch, and the best weekend of my life Brandon, wanted us to make follow-up videos to our original. After being there, and so here, I am and all my travel fabulous glory to tell you all about it. I just wanted to say that the most incredible part of this weekend to me, if I, had to pick one well, maybe there's two. The first is there was every single type of person there, black white, Hispanic, gay, straight transgender atheists, Christians I, talked to them all right and every last person had two things in common. The first is that they despised the hate, the division and the violence that is coming from the left, and the second is an undeniable love for America. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed. The media is lying and has been lying to us for ever for a really long time. The media has been lying to us. You know for a long time, I thought, because I was white, you know everybody hated me hell, I mean you got people telling telling me I should hate my own self for being white, you know, and then we have other people who think that, because I'm white I hate them none of it's true. None of it's true and here's. The thing I saw true patriotism. This weekend, I saw a group of individuals who dropped everything to make sure that they went came across the country to all unite together. To show that we are a force. Patriots in this country are a force to be reckoned with. We are tired of it and we are taking our country back. It was the most incredible weekend of my life. I am forever grateful being that I walked away. I am forever grateful that Brandon created this group and I am forever grateful that this movement, this campaign grows and grows and grows daily. We're not racists, we're not homophobic, we're, not bigots, we're, not misogynist, we're, not all the things, we're not those things. What we are are Americans who love our country and are walking away from the craziness. The left is trying to turn our country into I'm, ready for America, first again, I'm ready for us as a nation to unite and be on the same front where we take care of each other. You know, and the last thing I'll say about it and I- don't want to compare it to this, but this weekend was the closest I have felt since after 9/11 that feeling of we are one nation under God right. We are Patriots together, looking out for each other wanting what's best for each other, everybody was like. Can I hug, you can I have a picture with you, no matter what that person was. We were great for each other and happy to have each other and proud of each other or take impact our country, you guys, and it's just the most incredible thing. Thank you again for everybody who came I enjoyed meeting. All of you and I look forward to the red wave of 2018 as well as 2020. The walk away really is still just getting started, grateful to be a part of it. Thanks guys, bye, [Music]."
21,0T0camqk5qU,hi there I'd like to explain why I walked away firstly I must say that I was an independent who at times in the past have actually supported Democratic candidates at dinners for Democratic candidates fundraisers if I believed in the person but their agenda now has gotten so radical that I can't even support the Democratic Party at all I'd also like to say that as a it's an advert study of history that socialism and communism run hand in hand and we're going down the same trail that the Germans did and just prior to the Second World War the Italians did it's it's a sad thing so I cannot support anyone who is so radical that they can't even discuss a viewpoint without trying to demonize the other group this is what Hitler did with the Jews he demonized them and dehumanized them this is what the Italians did with the better ones they demonized him and dehumanized them so that they could justify slaughtering them and this is what the Liberals are doing today they're trying to dehumanize conservatives so that they have a reason to slaughter them in the future without any recourse so there's my story thank you you hi there I'd like to explain why I walked away firstly I must say that I was an independent who at times in the past have actually supported Democratic candidates at dinners for Democratic candidates fundraisers if I believed in the person but their agenda now has gotten so radical that I can't even support the Democratic Party at all I'd also like to say that as a it's an advert study of history that socialism and communism run hand in hand and we're going down the same trail that the Germans did and just prior to the Second World War the Italians did it's it's a sad thing so I cannot support anyone who is so radical that they can't even discuss a viewpoint without trying to demonize the other group this is what Hitler did with the Jews he demonized them and dehumanized them this is what the Italians did with the better ones they demonized him and dehumanized them so that they could justify slaughtering them and this is what the Liberals are doing today they're trying to dehumanize conservatives so that they have a reason to slaughter them in the future without any recourse so there's my story thank you you,"Hi there I'd like to explain why I walked away. Firstly, I must say that I was an independent who, at times in the past, have actually supported Democratic candidates at dinners for Democratic candidates, fundraisers, if I believed in the person, but their agenda now has gotten so radical that I can't even support the Democratic Party at all. I'd also like to say that as a it's, an advert study of history that socialism and communism run hand in hand and we're going down the same trail that the Germans did and just prior to the Second World War, the Italians did it's it's a sad thing. So I cannot support anyone who is so radical that they can't even discuss a viewpoint without trying to demonize the other group. This is what Hitler did with the Jews he demonized them and dehumanized them. This is what the Italians did with the better ones. They demonized him and dehumanized them so that they could justify slaughtering them, and this is what the Liberals are doing today: they're trying to dehumanize conservatives, so that they have a reason to slaughter them in the future without any recourse. So there's my story. Thank you. You hi there I'd like to explain why I walked away. Firstly, I must say that I was an independent who, at times in the past, have actually supported Democratic candidates at dinners for Democratic candidates, fundraisers, if I believed in the person, but their agenda now has gotten so radical that I can't even support the Democratic Party at all. I'd also like to say that as a it's, an advert study of history that socialism and communism run hand in hand and we're going down the same trail that the Germans did and just prior to the Second World War, the Italians did it's it's a sad thing.

In the future, without any recourse, so there's my story. Thank you. You."
22,1fFllyGSvK0,"hi just gonna give you a little bit of an update my name is Debbie and I am 53 years old and this is my walk away video for most of my life I was a registered independent but I voted Democrat for many years I voted for Bill Clinton twice I voted for Obama twice and I had a brother who kept telling me why do you keep voting the way you are and my thing was because I'm a lesbian and the Democrats are looking out for me not the Republicans well second term with Obama and I start to see things that didn't make a lot of sense I saw that things are being this world was getting racially charged I saw what was going on in Chicago thinking why is it so bad there and then the whole thing the Affordable Care Act my insurance went from great insurance that I didn't pay that much for but my deductible was very low my prescriptions were very low almost a year after the Affordable Care Act gets jammed in in through an executive order the next time I had to renew my insurance the premiums went up co-pays went up the minimums went up the deductibles so what I may have had a $1,000 deductible now it's 3000 her family plan it's 6500 who can afford that I went a couple of years without having insurance and I got fined from the state that I'm in for not having insurance then I got hit again for federally for not having insurance and those two fines together were less than what I was paying for insurance so it's the lesser of two evils now we can talk about the elections that were coming up with Hillary versus Trump when Trump first got into the ring I kind of laughed going he's never gonna go anywhere this is kind of funny and as he starts taking out one Republican after another and after another and after another so he's found the nominee I'm like whoa I need to check into a few things I went back looking up all sorts of videos from him I think that he was saying way back when he's on shell Donahue about the direction that this country was going before he even thought about running or being in politics everything that he said then is what he's saying now there are so many other videos that are out there of things that he said way before even being in the political spotlight people really should check that out then I start doing a lot of checking into Hillary Clinton and finding out how dirty she was how dirty the Clintons are then looked into more things about the Democratic National Committee the things that they pulled the fact that the Democrats are the ones have been holding us down for ever they want us poor they want people of color to abort did children they are the ones that are racist and the more I look into it the more I see how racist they actually are I have not seen or heard anything come out of president Trump's mouth about rates I've never heard him say anything disparaging Lee about homosexuals he has it and it's crazy I get so irritated watching the mainstream media with him lying over and over and over one of the biggest things that I witness was he's an augur Inauguration saying that nobody was there well they manipulated the folder the photos to look like there was nobody there but it was when it first started when people started just going in the other thing that I've seen is that your Trump says something if they don't put up the whole thing it'll just take a little bit to get a sound bite to make him look like he's racist homophobic and then I'll go back and watch the whole video and see that's not what he was saying so I talked to a few people and started questioning things and I had people saying oh my god are you gonna support Donald Trump are you crazy I had people calling me out telling me they would never talk to me again on Facebook I had I was in different groups that people started throwing me out of groups telling me that it couldn't be in these groups any more because I would not support Hillary Clinton well Hillary Clinton was gonna be a terrible president and she was part of this if they want to call it New World Order of just taking over everything and taking our rights from us and I just I just couldn't and now I find myself yes and I did I did vote for Donald Trump and I will vote for Donald Trump again because I totally totally agree with protecting our borders having a wall giving us different health care options deregulating a lot of things that he's done to help us well right now the number one supplier of oil and gas the United States is making money we're back in that world stage of being up there he's not apologizing to anybody this is how it is America's first and that's it and I know I'm going on a tangent here but there's just so many things I get so frustrated watching and listening to people just saying that he is a racist well how is he a racist show me that he's a racist I haven't seen it showed that he is anti-semitic he is not his daughter he's married to a Jewish man she converted to Judaism she her children a Jewish this is just more hate-filled lies that the left is doing it it took me not a long time to find out all the stuff that the left was lying about and I ended up walking away when I went to the voting booth and voted for Donald Trump I will never ever ever again vote for Democrat they're not looking out for us they're looking out for themselves pizza [Music]","Hi, just gonna give you a little bit of an update. My name is Debbie and I am 53 years old, and this is my walk away. Video for most of my life I was a registered independent but I voted Democrat for many years. I voted for Bill Clinton, twice, I voted for Obama twice and I had a brother who kept telling me. Why do you keep voting the way you are, and my thing was because I'm, a lesbian and the Democrats are looking out for me. Not the Republicans. Well, second term, with Obama and I start to see things that didn't make a lot of sense. I saw that things are being this world was getting racially charged. I saw what was going on in Chicago thinking. Why is it so bad there and then the whole thing? The Affordable Care Act, my insurance went from great insurance that I didn't pay that much for, but my deductible was very low. My prescriptions were very low. Almost a year after the Affordable Care Act gets jammed in in through an executive order. The next time I had to renew my insurance. The premiums went up, co-pays went up, the minimums went up the deductibles, so what I may have had a $1,000 deductible?

23,1grrLAyZ0Wo,"hi everybody I wanted to make a video because I got this in the mail today mm-hmm I have never ordered a shirt or a bumper sticker or anything for any type of movement in my life not a political one nothing but I felt really inspired by this movement and I wanted to show my support because it's I want people to ask me because I feel emboldened and empowered now to state my opinion and as long as you stay calm and respectful that I think that that can give us a long ways and so I made a video back like June 21st I think it was and I got a lot of support never done a video my entire life for anything I don't know what came over me but you know it was only a 3,000 people in the group at that time and now there's 163 which is wonderful awesome and if you guys didn't see that video former Bernie supporter lifelong liberal echo-chamber sjw the whole thing and came to the conclusion that I was wrong about about a lot of things and my assumptions I challenged myself and heard outside voices ben shapiro steven crowder Dave Rubin the Joe Rogan podcast I have sort of a boring job so I get to listen to podcasts all the time you know that long-form conversations are so important and I think a lot of us have come from the same place the people that are walking away from the left had never been privy to that type of information because it was just you know MSNBC CNN New York Times Washington Post all those kind of things that most of us have always been privy to and YouTube has made a huge difference I think in a lot of people's lives because they're seeing that that's humanizing these conversations there's Britney's bringing nuance it's not just memes you know and I think that's wonderful and I hope that more people sort of look at both sides like that like I did and I'm hoping that you know we're looking at all these rallies and everything and these protests and I'm hoping that our group I would go to a rally if we did like a community outreach at the same time because I think we really need to separate ourselves from you know just being against something being against something all the time it's always just against it's like well what are you for before when I was on the left eyes very nihilistic Mike oh yeah just burn the whole thing down and none of us working for anybody so just burn it all to the ground and had no really idea what I wanted specifically wanted to replace the government with you know all of our institutions it's just I just knew they were wrong and I think that's a pretty immature way to look at things you know I was wrong about that and I think moving forward it's a much healthier way to look at it that we need to build things together and so if we're gonna do a rally you know do a community outreach get out there with garbage sacks and clean up your community wear your gear you know have signs but be productive you know be a productive citizen and I'm loving getting to connect with conservatives who they very much think that most of them very much think that way they're very community oriented and I really appreciate that and so I'm hoping to bring that to my community you know and be kind and respectful and just I guess I'm a pragmatist you know something else I didn't mention in my other video was like where those ideas had come from that I believed in like questioning that you know that realizing a lot of the things I was thinking was Marxist grace who is on the walk away campaign she has a YouTube channel called embarrassing mom and she was a gender study major and she has a wonderful breakdown if you guys want to check her out about where these ideas are coming from from the far left it's not just out of nowhere I mean there's it's so when you're trying to have a conversation with someone that's you know on the left and they have a seem to have a different vocabulary if there's a very specific place where the stuff is coming from and so I think it's who anybody on the right to sort of look at that so that you can have a more productive conversation if you can have a conversation with people you know that about the identity politics and all that kind of stuff that's pretty insane right now anyways I just also refill here filled out my primary voter registered voter ballots and me my husband and we voted red for the first time in our lives pretty much down the ticket now I did consider myself an independent and but for the country and for bringing us together I think it's important too unless the Democrats you know come have a message can call out the extremists on their side I'm gonna have to vote Republican for now I'm sorry that's just the way it is I just I they with the socialist stuff scare me a little bit and but for mostly I just want to come to back together as you know a country and have it okay to be patriotic and yeah I think keep up the good work I'm really impressed with everybody's testimonials it has made me so hopeful and so grateful and made me love this country again and just want to take responsibility and do my part so anyways have a great day everybody much love bye","Hi everybody I wanted to make a video

that you know i'm kind of complacent i'm a complacent african-american i see myself as african-american that's another topic we could talk about but anyway african-american woman and i just was told all my life that my family and we're democrats when um for years for years up until literally last year maybe i literally just called my grandmother when it was time to exercise my voting right and i would say grandma can i go vote today who am i voting for and she tell me who to vote for and i walk my happy butt down there and i oh because i didn't take the time nor did i have the interest to

Actually, I'm just upset with myself that I allowed. I allow myself to be manipulated by not only the media, not only the republican and mainly the democratic party, but even like my my facebook timeline, the people I chose to follow. I don't know if anybody covered, you know, watches the matrix, but your girl. I took the red pill and I unplugged myself. Perhaps you should too you I'm sitting in my car as I just needed to. I have been literally, I think. In the last couple of weeks I have been on this almost obsession over uncovering the truth. I mean I've known this for a while that the media will have fake news on both sides, both whether you're talking about fox or you're, talking about cnn or whatever, and I've always kind of questioned the media. But I will admit that you know I'm kind of complacent, I'm a complacent african-american. I see myself as african-american. That's another topic we could talk about, but anyway african-american woman and I just was told all my life that my family and we're democrats when um for years for years, up until literally last year, maybe I literally just called my grandmother when it was time to exercise my voting right and I would say grandma can I go vote today? Who am I voting for and she tell me who to vote for, and I walk my happy butt down there and I oh because I didn't take the time. Nor did I have the interest to really know who and what I was gonna go vote for. I just believed my grandmother. I just believed what she said and there's nothing wrong with. You know believing what your parents and your family members say. I guess when you're a child, you know um, but when you become an adult and you you go to learn how, to you know be a critical thinker in school. At least I hope you are learning that and then you don't apply that to your life. You become part of the problem and I have been part of the problem. I have been part of my the my problems. I have been part of the problems that I'm upset about, because I have systematically continue to vote for the democratic party just because my grandmother told me to just because I'm black or consider myself black, that's what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to believe everything the democrats say I'm supposed to believe everyone else who is a democrat and what they're saying and lately I have been having a real issue with what even people on my timeline are saying. Just if you were to just look at my timeline, I now understand why people might want to commit suicide, especially a person of color. It sounds like you know the cops around every corner ready to shoot me for doing nothing, that a white person is ready to call the cops on me, which I mean they they are doing and don't get me wrong. There are racist people in this world, there's a racist person on every freaking corner. I like whether I know that or not they've got racism somewhere in them. I mean. Is that really going to end and did that end? When obama was in office and then all of a sudden it just oh, it comes back because trump is in office.

25,1Ur8Qm7ySfg,hey my name is delle striker and I love the walk away campaign and it's been such a blessing in my life I just wanted to share a video I posted July 23rd and told about my walk away experiences but I've had to walk away from a lot of things in my life when I was 17 I walked away from my Jewish whole town and Long Island went to college and went to three different colleges made it that back to Berkeley and Berkeley was quite an experience and that's when I decided to walk away from college and ended up hitchhiking back to New York sent to a kibbutz in Israel with my first husband and I had to walk away from my first commune because they actually asked us to leave for kissing in front of the dining room so I had to walk away a lot and I had to walk away from Israel altogether and made it to Europe hitchhiked through Europe and came back to the States and ended up in the Ozark Mountains and found my people in the Midwest hard-working kind loving people and lots of hippies were part of the back-to-the-land movement and then Jesus found me at 24 so then I had to walk away from the hippie friends because they didn't want to hear about Jesus and then I ended up coming to Florida and I found it past my own congregation and again walking away from my family who didn't accept it and walked away from my first marriage because he didn't get me he thought finding other women was okay and I did that the second time I found the same thing happening again so I had to walk away from my second marriage but my walk away political moments came early on back in the Ozarks when I read none dare call a conspiracy and found out that really the world banking system ran everything and the dark this was you didn't wind up with the Bible's that made a lot of sense so it kind of walked away from politics it wasn't till I passed through the chirps I decided to become a Republican and they will pro-life so let's before that and Bill Clinton already done slime and perversion in the Oval Office which everyone seems to have forgotten and they pay him exhorted about some money to speak and his wife just sat there really I woulda had a frying pan out would hit him over the head something some kind of box I'm sensing somehow I think their marriage wasn't what it looked like and I walked away from that and wasn't excited about Bush though we voted Republican always if they're Pro is real and they're pro-life let's go for it give it a chance that's lesser of two evils and then the Holy Spirit woke me up in August right before Trump's election said I want you to pray for Donald Trump I kind of said are you kidding I knew him I didn't know much about him and then I realized not only is God asking me to intercede for him and I didn't expect him to win the election I better start studying and finding out what really is going on in the political world YouTube has been great dinesh d'souza anomaly forgetting it so lost in YouTube boom from place to place I found out everything that I already knew that the darkness was huge and great and the corruption was huge and great enough to point to be sickening it was very hard to adjust to getting all that information in and keeping a prayer life at the same time but it stirred my prayer life up and got me on the right track so I thank God for waking me up through Donald Trump definitely was apathetic I thought there was no hope for the government I thought we're all gonna be trisexual by the time we're done um I don't think I ever thought in my day that it would get this bad it's interesting when you're 68 I've always thought Jesus was coming back at a time on 50 so we'd have to face any of this now I have to realize the prayer life and your recession has to be more than it's ever been because we are on the brink of something and this walkaway campaign had only its waking up people daily but that is stirring the earth and saying this gonna be a great revival there's gonna be a great great outpouring of his spirit in his love it's gonna be divine it's not gonna be through church it's gonna be divine intervention of God with people waking them up and I want to be part of it I want to be praying for it I care about my children my grandchildren everyone's grandchildren I care about America own what America's been built on what stands for I care about Israel and how Israel finally has a friend and finally has a president that has the guts to move the embassy and we have the president's first daughter in the White House Jewish married to a Jew raising three Jewish children hello so I also want to share what it's like to be a liberal liberalism is a disease it's a mental disorder it's also a religion and so people are really really upset that their religion is being shipped to the core my faith and my beliefs have always been shook a whole thing my life and I started realizing that really if I just think opposite then I did as a hippie at age 23 getting saved at 24 that that's probably what Jesus would say what Jesus would do so I've been used to this but for people who are not and believed in this corruption all these years just shake in the very core of them the Bible said there's gonna be weeping and gnashing your teeth we're getting hell is burping is what's going on that's what's going on the media they've gone crazy they're mad they're they're beyond logic there is no logic to any of but in it in the darkness and in the ugliness more people are running away from the Democratic Party more people are getting awake and this is a chance for a great revival this is a chance to be a prayer warrior this is a chance to be awake and studying and learning I mean there won't even be YouTube left we're gonna need books it's not a bad time to start saving books but we really need each other we need to stand for the truth I don't really want to hear about the media I've never been a media person with the hippies we knew the media wasn't good was was faked back then how come some of my hippie friends hook line sinker believe the media I got no idea we knew then that they were teaching how to dress they were teaching you what to wear they were teaching you how to think that's what the whole Pippi movement was about knowing that the establishment was corrupt I'm trying to push an agenda I don't know what happened to people except complacency and I'd have become complacent too I had going there's no hope why bother praying so I'm very excited for this campaign I just want to share my heart I want to remind people that what's going on in liberalism out of them now the heart speaketh so what's coming out people's mouths is what's in their heart and the only hope they have is Jesus Christ the only hope they have is salvation because the heart has to change before the thoughts change and the mind changes so thank you for watching and I pray you have a blessed day that you start influencing more people that you stand up for righteousness and that you're protected and the angel of the Lord surrounds you in Jesus name Amen hey my name is delle striker and I love the walk away campaign and it's been such a blessing in my

We're gonna need books, it's not a bad time to start saving books, but we really need each other. We need to stand for the truth. I don't really want to hear about the media. I've never been a media person with the hippies. We knew the media wasn't good. Was was faked back then, how come some of my hippie friends hook, line sinker, believe the media I got no idea. We knew then that they were teaching how to dress. They were teaching you what to wear. They were teaching you how to think that's what the whole Pippi movement was about, knowing that the establishment was corrupt, I'm trying to push an agenda I, don't know what happened to people except complacency and I'd have become complacent too I had going. There's no hope. Why bother praying so I'm very excited for this campaign. I just want to share my heart. I want to remind people that, what's going on in liberalism out of them now the heart speaketh so what's coming out, people's mouths is what's in their heart and the only hope they have is Jesus Christ. The only hope they have is salvation because the heart has to change before the thoughts change and the mind changes. So thank you for watching and I pray. You have a blessed day that you start influencing more people, that you stand up for righteousness and that you're protected and the angel of the Lord surrounds. You in Jesus name Amen,."

27,223_vVNHGzI,"greetings in love a'tall you walk away errs out there who are assumed to be the runaway movement because it's running away like the runaway trump train now I think it's said 140,000 that it's reached up I've been communicating with this site since it started a little Easter when I found out about it which was like July 2nd I suppose I don't know how long it's gone on but I've done some letters that had a hard time being published through a series of mishaps and problems and also now I've had my video line that's gonna be on YouTube and I put a longer version that's gonna be on YouTube that was 25 minutes long a lot of people have long ones on here but mine was keeps getting rejected for some reason so now there's all of a sudden saying everyone's has to be shorter so I'm making the short one with the timer on and I just have a lot of stuff to cover that I can talk about him 54 years old it was a Democrat most of my life I was in the Air Force at 17 years old until 21 and learned a lot about the government and a lot about the world and the way things work and when you're on talking to people on this site they're reading what people say in this site you know a lot of the people are younger people who all they know is Obama and Bernie and you know the more recent stuff that's gone out of our country they're not really aware of well they're not aware of the history of this country very much at all a lot of times you see this on the some of the newer shows or they ask you to fight the Revolutionary War who fought the Civil War they don't know you literally know almost nothing so um it's very important for people to learn that there's a historical political and most importantly spiritual element to all of this my wife and I both have Lyme disease she's had it since 74 and I've had it since 94 and what I see happening with this walkaway movement is that people are very sort of in shock they're they're surprised at the level of animosity and hatred that's falling out of people at them in their own families and this is something that we strangely are used to because people with Lyme disease have their own line community it's all worldwide and when you have Lyme disease it's very much like the early days of AIDS where there's an extreme attack that goes along with it where you're not just sick and dying or feeling bad you're brutally attacked by the medical community by your family you're ostracized you're accused of thinking for how sick you are it's an amazing experience to go through but it trains you in what spiritual warfare is we're experiencing in our society right now is an unparalleled spiritual war that's taking place and it's very serious and it's very powerful and this is why people are having such a strong reaction to this walkaway movement because this is a movement of love and it's more a movement of seeing what's really going on where there's this this strong brutal hatred towards trauma and it's not just towards Republicans it's more towards Trump and if you really think about it it's towards the women in his family and the kids in his family and you know even little kids so it's a you know this is the stuff that's it's pushing people over the edge where they can't take it anymore looking back I want to explain our walk away in my walk away you know like most people I grew up believing the Democratic Party cared more about the poor the Republicans I always knew were old white rich warmongering you know this was something that was kind of just known about Republicans because that was what it was like in our lifetime we had Nixon and we had Ford and these people were freemasons the founders of our country were freemasons they weren't Christians they were Christians at the surface but underneath there were members of the secret society this is something a lot of people don't know about and understand but it's really important because if you're gonna research this it's important to know what the history of our country is and it's built on Freemasonry which at its core and its rut isn't it as a worship of Egyptian deities back in time or even predating that to a Syrian and Mesopotamian deities like the moon-god it's unbelievable when you research this stuff you find all this out Romney and McCain who are the two that ran against Obama Obama came along and deceived a lot of people and even though he deceived people he was a more peaceful person and then a column or character even though I didn't agree with what he was doing I still voted for him because even as a Roman Catholic which is what we are obviously I'm bringing up the spiritual aspect of this because it's very important to see that this is a war and to see that how who's good who's bad McCain wanted to fight the whole world he was ready to go to war with Syria Iran Iraq Afghanistan China North Korea I mean he would have had us fighting everyone then he had Willard Romney whose name isn't met its Willard and he was just a horrible guy that just lied three four or five times in one sentence he'd lie and he showed this horrible disdain caught on tape where he called people you know that a certain percent forty seven percent or whatever so he literally was bashing half the country which then Hillary made the exact same mistake and it's called you know a big chunk of the country deplorable it's funny in a way but this is what happened and so I don't regret voting for Obama like a lot of people do because he was the lesser of two evils as a Catholic which I brought started to pro-life is usually the main cause so there's literally Christians and there's literally Catholics who will vote Republicans simply on the pro-life issue pro-life is a huge huge thing to open up no one sane wants things to go back to the back-alley days and no one's saying wants to take away a woman's free will or purse any human beings free but they also don't want to judge someone from being homosexual it's wrong and you're just not supposed to judge anyone you're not supposed to accept people that are evil though and that's different a way a person lives their life is not necessarily good or evil as long as they're not hurting other people it's when you start hurting other people in lying and smearing and degrading and accusing is the word and Lucifer who's the devil was called Satan by Jesus in the Bible when he called Lucifer Satan the name Satan in his Aramaic tongue meant the accuser what you see going on with Donald Trump is accusation after accusation after accusation you know and it's all lies if you look at his history he said seventy years of never being called a racist through a bigot he was the first person to stick up for equal rights for homosexual people he being he hired blots on homosexuals based on their capability to do a job not I'm he didn't care about their sexual preference he said right there in Advocate magazine in 2001 before the Clintons did that he was for equal treatment of games not preferential but equal which is what every emergency line is just to be get an equal shot of things he stood hired women for his construction sites his for women he had a woman designed the first Trump Tower so she was the first person to ever build a skyscraper first female I should say the build a skyscraper was was hired by Trump so he has a whole history of standing up for the black people standing up for the Jewish people in Florida and all the different minorities for attending his clubs people don't know the true history of the man and what he really did and what he stood up for over the years because they just see his exterior and maybe the way he conducts himself no politician ever that I've read about and in my 54 years on earth has ever gone into a campaign and promised buh-buh-buh-buh-buh big long list of stuff and actually done they all say they're gonna do everything and then they do almost nothing he's the exact opposite he's literally stuck with every single thing that he said he was going to do he's done which is remarkable from anyone's perspective and this is why everyone is freaking out so bad at him the best people listen to about the history of the Democrats as some of the African American or black people on here whatever word we would term we want to use I say black I don't say african-american because then we'd go around saying European American and Irish German Swedish American and you know it can get way out of control the black people on here very articulate they come on here and articulate beautifully the history of the Democratic Party which I never knew in my whole life they were supported Jim Crow they supported the KKK is supported keeping slaves they support welfare which sort of does keep people enslaved and certainly some people need welfare and welfare is good and we should have welfare but socialism doesn't work it's never worked in any country it didn't work by its inventors the first Christians and acts in the Bible tried it and it didn't work even then because it requires everyone to be honest and to share everything equally and no one's ever going to do that there's always going to be the greedy that take for themselves the modern Democratic Party is evil and the Republican Party has been evil people need to research about Bohemian Grove which is where Republicans and the movers and shakers of the world have gone for years and years and I don't know where that time the Republicans for years allowed to but we mean Grove and they actually literally have human sacrifice rituals that take place and supposedly they're staged and it's a staged production and it probably is but the point is is why would they do something like that why would people sit there rich millionaire billionaire heads of countries heads of you know corporations be out in the woods is all meeting together hanging out and watching a mock ritual sacrifice before a giant owl statue Idol of Moloch which is in the Bible about a thousand times not to worship this is what they've done there's pictures of Reagan and the Bush family and all these people how are the Bohemian Grove down through the last decades of this century they've been out there so they've been dramatically spiritually evil for real and with the Democratic Party we find out that Obama and many of the other people followed the teachings of Saul linski Hillary Clinton wrote her de master's thesis or whatever whatever her highest educational paper that she wrote was on the teachings of the Saul Alinsky and Obama followed Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals and he gives credit to Lucifer as being the one that rebelled and gained his own Kingdom the first great regret all you know so literally they run their party based on these ideals that were a Satanist formed them and then you have John Podesta Tony who are the biggest operators for the Democratic Party in Washington DC John Podesta was Bill and Hillary Clinton's chief of staff and was going to be Hillary's chief of staff and he's literally such a bad person that he's a not only just a Satanist but he's actually a pedophile and a cannibal and they don't hide it you can look inside look on the internet and just look up type in Podesta art collection you don't need to look in the pizza gate you don't need to look at the dramatic reams and reams of WikiLeaks files and evil stuff about these people you all you need to do is do Podesta hard collection and look what these people have hanging in their houses the statues and the pictures on their walls it's a child torture it's a pornography it's a mutilation cannibalism Satanism this stuff is on there in their house on their walls this is these are the worst kind of people that have ever been in this country and they're running things behind the scenes this is why the Democratic Party is the way it is it's actually possessed if you saw it with Peter struck the other day these aren't people that are just bad or greedy people that want a little money these are people that are actually so spiritual evil they're willing to ruin people they're willing to kill people they're willing to start riots they're willing to turn black against white they're willing to turn homosexual against homosexual husband against wife you know they're they're just they're sowing the seeds of discord and dissent and hate and this movement is the exact opposite of that this is a beautiful movement of love and peace and it's amazing it's amazing what we read on here and seeing here that let testimony's you're so beautiful they make you cry you hear so many people walking away from the hate walking away from this anger and this viciousness and this is what needs to happen in the this enlightenment needs to continuing to grow and it is growing it's turning into a beautiful spark of light that's spreading through the world and spreading in our country and literally what I think we're gonna reach a million more and there'll be a March and there'll be all these things so this is beautiful and we're grateful to be a part of it and I have a longer version of this and the longer version is going to be on YouTube where I original one that did that keeps getting rejected even though other people have ones that are happening online I'm here my long half 25 minute one is gonna be on YouTube where I'm a little more in depth on a few of these things so I'll just sign off here and say we love you all and God bless you and we're glad that this movement is taking place and helping people to wake up and please walk away walk away from hate walk away from darkness and evil walk away from the Democratic Party which is turned on all the way Derek right now in our time god bless you

on YouTube where I'm a little more in depth on a few of these things so I'll just sign off here and say we love you all and God bless you and we're glad that this movement is taking place and helping people to wake up and please walk away walk away from hate walk away from darkness and evil walk away from the Democratic Party which is turned on all the way Derek right now in our time god bless you all greetings in love a'tall you walk away errs out there who are assumed to be the runaway movement because it's running away like the runaway trump train now I think it's said 140,000 that it's reached up I've been communicating with this site since it started a little Easter when I found out about it which was like July 2nd I suppose I don't know how long it's gone on but I've done some letters that had a hard time being published through a series of mishaps and problems and also now I've had my video line that's gonna be on YouTube and I put a longer version that's gonna be on YouTube that was 25 minutes long a lot of people have long ones on here but mine was keeps getting rejected for some reason so now there's all of a sudden saying everyone's has to be shorter so I'm making the short one with the timer on and I just have a lot of stuff to cover that I can talk about him 54 years old it was a Democrat most of my life I was in the Air Force at 17 years old until 21 and learned a lot about the government and a lot about the world and the way things work and when you're on talking to people on this site they're reading what people say in this site you know a lot of the people are younger people who all they know is Obama and Bernie and you know the more recent stuff that's gone out of our country they're not really aware of well they're not aware of the history of this country very much at all a lot of times you see this on the some of the newer shows or they ask you to fight the Revolutionary War who fought the Civil War they don't know you literally know almost nothing so um it's very important for people to learn that there's a historical political and most importantly spiritual element to all of this my wife and I both have Lyme disease she's had it since 74 and I've had it since 94 and what I see happening with this walkaway movement is that people are very sort of in shock they're they're surprised at the level of animosity and hatred that's falling out of people at them in their own families and this is something that we strangely are used to because people with Lyme disease have their own line community it's all worldwide and when you have Lyme disease it's very much like the early days of AIDS where there's an extreme attack that goes along with it where you're not just sick and dying or feeling bad you're brutally attacked by the medical community by your family you're ostracized you're accused of thinking for how sick you are it's an amazing experience to go through but it trains you in what spiritual warfare is we're experiencing in our society right now is an unparalleled spiritual war that's taking place and it's very serious and it's very powerful and this is why people are having such a strong reaction to this walkaway movement because this is a movement of love and it's more a movement of seeing what's really going on where there's this this strong brutal hatred towards trauma and it's not just towards Republicans it's more towards Trump and if you really think about it it's towards the women in his family and the kids in his family and you know even little kids so it's a you know this is the stuff that's it's pushing people over the edge where they can't take it anymore looking back I want to explain our walk away in my walk away you know like most people I grew up believing the Democratic Party cared more about the poor the Republicans I always knew were old white rich warmongering you know this was something that was kind of just known about Republicans because that was what it was like in our lifetime we had Nixon and we had Ford and these people were freemasons the founders of our country were freemasons they weren't Christians they were Christians at the surface but underneath there were members of the secret society this is something a lot of people don't know about and understand but it's really important because if you're gonna research this it's important to know what the history of our country is and it's built on Freemasonry which at its core and its rut isn't it as a worship of Egyptian deities back in time or even predating that to a Syrian and Mesopotamian deities like the moon-god it's unbelievable when you research this stuff you find all this out Romney and McCain who are the two that ran against Obama Obama came along and deceived a lot of people and even though he deceived people he was a more peaceful person and then a column or character even though I didn't agree with what he was doing I still voted for him because even as a Roman Catholic which is what we are obviously I'm bringing up the spiritual aspect of this because it's very important to see that this is a war and to see that how who's good who's bad McCain wanted to fight the whole world he was ready to go to war with Syria Iran Iraq Afghanistan China North Korea I mean he would have had us fighting everyone then he had Willard Romney whose name isn't met its Willard and he was just a horrible guy that just lied three four or five times in one sentence he'd lie and he showed this horrible disdain caught on tape where he called people you know that a certain percent forty seven percent or whatever so he literally was bashing half the country which then Hillary made the exact same mistake and it's called you know a big chunk of the country deplorable it's funny in a way but this is what happened and so I don't regret voting for Obama like a lot of people do because he was the lesser of two evils as a Catholic which I brought started to pro-life is usually the main cause so there's literally Christians and there's literally Catholics who will vote Republicans simply on the pro-life issue pro-life is a huge huge thing to open up no one sane wants things to go back to the back-alley days and no one's saying wants to take away a woman's free will or purse any human beings free but they also don't want to judge someone from being homosexual it's wrong and you're just not supposed to judge anyone you're not supposed to accept people that are evil though and that's different a way a person lives their life is not necessarily good or evil as long as they're not hurting other people it's when you start hurting other people in lying and smearing and degrading and accusing is the word and Lucifer who's the devil was called Satan by Jesus in the Bible when he called Lucifer Satan the name Satan in his Aramaic tongue meant the accuser what you see going on with Donald Trump is accusation after accusation after accusation you know and it's all lies if you look at his history he said seventy years of never being called a racist through a bigot he was the first person to stick up for equal rights for homosexual people he being he hired blots on homosexuals based on their capability to do a job not I'm he didn't care about their sexual preference he said right there in Advocate magazine in 2001 before the Clintons did that he was for equal treatment of games not preferential but equal which is what every emergency line is just to be get an equal shot of things he stood hired women for his construction sites his for women he had a woman designed the first Trump Tower so she was the first person to ever build a skyscraper first female I should say the build a skyscraper was was hired by Trump so he has a whole history of standing up for the black people standing up for the Jewish people in Florida and all the different minorities for attending his clubs people don't know the true history of the man and what he really did and what he stood up for over the years because they just see his exterior and maybe the way he conducts himself no politician ever that I've read about and in my 54 years on earth has ever gone into a campaign and promised buh-buh-buh-buh-buh big long list of stuff and actually done they all say they're gonna do everything and then they do almost nothing he's the exact opposite he's literally stuck with every single thing that he said he was going to do he's done which is remarkable from anyone's perspective and this is why everyone is freaking out so bad at him the best people listen to about the history of the Democrats as some of the African American or black people on here whatever word we would term we want to use I say black I don't say african-american because then we'd go around saying European American and Irish German Swedish American and you know it can get way out of control the black people on here very articulate they come on here and articulate beautifully the history of the Democratic Party which I never knew in my whole life they were supported Jim Crow they supported the KKK is supported keeping slaves they support welfare which sort of does keep people enslaved and certainly some people need welfare and welfare is good and we should have welfare but socialism doesn't work it's never worked in any country it didn't work by its inventors the first Christians and acts in the Bible tried it and it didn't work even then because it requires everyone to be honest and to share everything equally and no one's ever going to do that there's always going to be the greedy that take for themselves the modern Democratic Party is evil and the Republican Party has been evil people need to research about Bohemian Grove which is where Republicans and the movers and shakers of the world have gone for years and years and I don't know where that time the Republicans for years allowed to but we mean Grove and they actually literally have human sacrifice rituals that take place and supposedly they're staged and it's a staged production and it probably is but the point is is why would they do something like that why would people sit there rich millionaire billionaire heads of countries heads of you know corporations be out in the woods is all meeting together hanging out and watching a mock ritual sacrifice before a giant owl statue Idol of Moloch which is in the Bible about a thousand times not to worship this is what they've done there's pictures of Reagan and the Bush family and all these people how are the Bohemian Grove down through the last decades of this century they've been out there so they've been dramatically spiritually evil for real and with the Democratic Party we find out that Obama and many of the other people followed the teachings of Saul linski Hillary Clinton wrote her de master's thesis or whatever whatever her highest educational paper that she wrote was on the teachings of the Saul Alinsky and Obama followed Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals and he gives credit to Lucifer as being the one that rebelled and gained his own Kingdom the first great regret all you know so literally they run their party based on these ideals that were a Satanist formed them and then you have John Podesta Tony who are the biggest operators for the Democratic Party in Washington DC John Podesta was Bill and Hillary Clinton's chief of staff and was going to be Hillary's chief of staff and he's literally such a bad person that he's a not only just a Satanist but he's actually a pedophile and a cannibal and they don't hide it you can look inside look on the internet and just look up type in Podesta art collection you don't need to look in the pizza gate you don't need to look at the dramatic reams and reams of WikiLeaks files and evil stuff about these people you all you need to do is do Podesta hard collection and look what these people have hanging in their houses the statues and the pictures on their walls it's a child torture it's a pornography it's a mutilation cannibalism Satanism this stuff is on there in their house on their walls this is these are the worst kind of people that have ever been in this country and they're running things behind the scenes this is why the Democratic Party is the way it is it's actually possessed if you saw it with Peter struck the other day these aren't people that are just bad or greedy people that want a little money these are people that are actually so spiritual evil they're willing to ruin people they're willing to kill people they're willing to start riots they're willing to turn black against white they're willing to turn homosexual against homosexual husband against wife you know they're they're just they're sowing the seeds of discord and dissent and hate and this movement is the exact opposite of that this is a beautiful movement of love and peace and it's amazing it's amazing what we read on here and seeing here that let testimony's you're so beautiful they make you cry you hear so many people walking away from the hate walking away from this anger and this viciousness and this is what needs to happen in the this enlightenment needs to continuing to grow and it is growing it's turning into a beautiful spark of light that's spreading through the world and spreading in our country and literally what I think we're gonna reach a million more and there'll be a March and there'll be all these things so this is beautiful and we're grateful to be a part of it and I have a longer version of this and the longer version is going to be on YouTube where I original one that did that keeps getting rejected even though other people have ones that are happening online I'm here my long half 25 minute one is gonna be on YouTube where I'm a little more in depth on a few of these things so I'll just sign off here and say we love you all and God bless you and we're glad that this movement is taking place and helping people to wake up and please walk away walk away from hate walk away from darkness and evil walk away from the Democratic Party which is turned on all the way Derek right now in our time god bless you all","Greetings in love, a'tall, you walk away errs out there who are assumed to be the runaway movement, because it's running away like the runaway trump train now I think it's said, 140,000 that it's reached up I've been communicating with this site, since it started a little Easter when I found out about it, which was like July, 2nd, I, suppose I, don't know how long it's gone on, but I've done some letters that had a hard time being published through a series of mishaps and problems, and also now I've had my video line. That's gonna be on YouTube and I put a longer version. That's gonna be on YouTube. That was 25 minutes long. A lot of people have long ones on here, but mine was keeps getting rejected for some reason. So now, there's all of a sudden saying everyone's has to be shorter, so I'm making the short one with the timer on and I just have a lot of stuff to cover that I can talk about him. 54 years old, it was a Democrat. Most of my life I was in the Air Force at 17 years old until 21, and learned a lot about the government and a lot about the world and the way things work and when you're, on talking to people on this site, they're reading what people say in this site, you know a lot of the people are younger people who all they know is Obama and Bernie, and you know the more recent stuff that's gone out of our country. They're, not really aware of well they're, not aware of the history of this country very much at all a lot of times. You see this on the some of the newer shows, or they ask you to fight the Revolutionary War, who fought the Civil War. They don't know, you literally know almost nothing so um, it's very important for people to learn that there's a historical, political and, most importantly, spiritual element to all of this. My wife and I both have Lyme disease she's had it since 74 and I've had it since 94, and what I see happening with this walkaway movement is that people are very sort of in shock. They're they're surprised at the level of animosity and hatred, that's falling out of people at them in their own families, and this is something that we strangely are used to, because people with Lyme disease have their own line community it's all worldwide and when you have Lyme disease, it's very much like the early days of AIDS, where there's an extreme attack that goes along with it, where you're not just sick and dying or feeling bad you're, brutally attacked by the medical community by your family, you're, ostracized, you're, accused of thinking for how sick you are it's an amazing experience to go through, but it trains you in what spiritual warfare is we're experiencing in our society. Right now is an unparalleled spiritual war, that's taking place and it's very serious and it's very powerful, and this is why people are having such a strong reaction to this walkaway movement, because this is a movement of love and it's more a movement of seeing what's really going on. Where there's this, this strong brutal hatred towards trauma- and it's not just towards Republicans, it's more towards Trump, and if you really think about it, it's towards the women in his family and the kids in his family, and you know even little kids. So it's a you know. This is the stuff. That's it's pushing people over the edge where they can't take it anymore. Looking back I want to explain our walk away in my walk away. You know, like most people, I grew up believing the Democratic Party cared more about the poor. The Republicans I always knew were old, white rich warmongering. You know this was something that was kind of just known about Republicans, because that was what it was like in our lifetime. We had Nixon and we had Ford, and these people were freemasons. The founders of our country were freemasons, they weren't Christians. They were Christians at the surface, but underneath there were members of the secret society. This is something a lot of people, don't know about and understand, but it's really important because if you're gonna research this it's important to know what the history of our country is and it's built on, Freemasonry, which, at its core and its rut, isn't it as a worship of Egyptian deities back in time or even predating, that to a Syrian and Mesopotamian deities like the moon-god, it's unbelievable when you research this stuff, you find all this out. Romney and McCain, who are the two that ran against Obama Obama came along and deceived a lot of people, and even though he deceived people, he was a more peaceful person and then a column or character, even though I didn't agree with what he was doing. I still voted for him because even as a Roman Catholic, which is what we are obviously I'm, bringing up the spiritual aspect of this, because it's very important to see that this is a war and to see that how who's good who's bad McCain wanted to fight the whole world. He was ready to go to war with Syria Iran Iraq Afghanistan, China, North Korea I mean he would have had us fighting everyone. Then he had Willard Romney, whose name isn't met its Willard and he was just a horrible guy that just lied. Three four or five times in one sentence. He'd lie and he showed this horrible disdain caught on tape where he called people. You know that a certain percent, forty seven percent or whatever so he literally was bashing half the country, which then Hillary made the exact same mistake, and it's called you know a big chunk of the country deplorable, it's funny in a way, but this is what happened and so I don't regret. Voting for Obama, like a lot of people do because he was the lesser of two evils as a Catholic which I brought started to pro-life is usually the main cause. So there's literally Christians and there's literally Catholics, who will vote Republicans simply on the pro-life issue. Pro-Life is a huge, huge thing to open up. No one sane wants things to go back to the back-alley days and no one's saying wants to take away a woman's free will or purse any human beings free, but they also don't want to judge someone from being homosexual. It's wrong and you're, just not supposed to judge anyone you're not supposed to accept people that are evil, though, and that's different a way a person lives. Their life is not necessarily good or evil as long as they're not hurting other people, it's when you start hurting other people in lying and smearing and degrading and accusing is the word and Lucifer who's. The devil was called Satan by Jesus in the Bible when he called Lucifer Satan. The name Satan in his Aramaic tongue meant the accuser. What you see going on with Donald Trump is accusation after accusation, after accusation, you know, and it's all lies. If you look at his history, he said seventy years of never being called a racist through a bigot. He was the first person to stick up for equal rights for homosexual people. He being he hired blots on homosexuals based on their capability to do a job, not I'm. He didn't care about their sexual preference. He said right there in Advocate magazine in 2001, before the Clintons did that he was for equal treatment of games, not preferential but equal, which is what every emergency line is just to be get an equal shot of things. He stood hired women for his construction sites, his for women. He had a woman designed the first Trump Tower, so she was the first person to ever build a skyscraper first female I should say the build a skyscraper was was hired by Trump, so he has a whole history of standing up for the black people, standing up for the Jewish people in Florida and all the different minorities for attending his clubs. People don't know the true history of the man and what he really did and what he stood up for over the years, because they just see his exterior and maybe the way he conducts himself no politician ever that I've read about and in my 54 years on earth has ever gone into a campaign and promised buh-buh-buh-buh-buh big long list of stuff and actually done they all say: they're gonna do everything, and then they do almost nothing he's the exact opposite he's literally stuck with every single thing that he said he was going to do he's done, which is remarkable from anyone's perspective, and this is why everyone is freaking out so bad at him.

The black people on here very articulate. They come on here and articulate beautifully the history of the Democratic Party, which I never knew. In my whole life. They were supported, Jim Crow, they supported the KKK is supported, keeping slaves, they support welfare, which sort of does keep people enslaved, and certainly some people need welfare and welfare is good and we should have welfare, but socialism doesn't work.

There's always going to be the greedy that take for themselves. The modern Democratic Party is evil and the Republican Party has been evil. People need to research about Bohemian Grove, which is where Republicans and the movers and shakers of the world have gone for years and years and I, don't know where that time the Republicans for years allowed to, but we mean Grove and they actually literally have human sacrifice, rituals that take place and supposedly they're staged and it's a staged production, and it probably is, but the point is, is why would they do something like that? Why would people sit there rich, millionaire, billionaire heads of countries, heads of you know, corporations be out in the woods, is all meeting together hanging out and watching a mock ritual sacrifice before a giant owl statue Idol of Moloch, which is in the Bible about a thousand times not to worship. This is what they've done: there's pictures of Reagan and the Bush family and all these people. How are the Bohemian Grove down through the last decades of this century, they've been out there, so they've been dramatically spiritually evil for real and with the Democratic Party we find out that Obama and many of the other people followed.

The first great regret all you know so literally they run their party based on these ideals that were a Satanist formed them, and then you have John Podesta Tony, who are the biggest operators for the Democratic Party in Washington DC John Podesta was Bill and Hillary Clinton's chief of staff and was going to be Hillary's chief of staff and he's literally such a bad person that he's a not only just a Satanist but he's actually a pedophile and a cannibal, and they don't hide it. You can look inside, look on the internet and just look up type in Podesta art collection. You don't need to look in the pizza gate. You don't need to look at the dramatic reams and reams of WikiLeaks files and evil stuff about these people. You all you need to do is do Podesta hard collection and look what these people have hanging in their houses, the statues and the pictures on their walls. It's a child torture, it's a pornography. It's a mutilation, cannibalism, Satanism! This stuff is on there in their house on their walls. This is these are the worst kind of people that have ever been in this country and they're running things behind the scenes. This is why the Democratic Party is the way it is. It's actually possessed if you saw it with Peter struck the other day. These aren't people that are just bad or greedy people that want a little money. These are people that are actually so spiritual, evil, they're willing to ruin people they're willing to kill people, they're willing to start riots, they're willing to turn black against white they're willing to turn homosexual against homosexual husband against wife. You know: they're they're, just they're sowing the seeds of discord and dissent and hate, and this movement is the exact opposite of that. This is a beautiful movement of love and peace, and it's amazing. It's amazing what we read on here and seeing here that let testimony's you're so beautiful they make you cry. You hear so many people walking away from the hate walking away from this anger and this viciousness- and this is what needs to happen in the this enlightenment- needs to continuing to grow and it is growing it's turning into a beautiful spark of light, that's spreading through the world and spreading in our country and literally what I think we're gonna reach a million more and there'll, be a March and there'll be all these things. So this is beautiful and we're grateful to be a part of it and I have a longer version of this, and the longer version is going to be on YouTube, where I original one that did that keeps getting rejected, even though other people have ones that are happening online I'm here, my long half 25 minute, one is gonna, be on YouTube, where I'm a little more in depth on a few of these things, so I'll just sign off here and say we love you all and God bless you and we're glad that this movement is taking place and helping people to wake up and please walk away, walk away from hate, walk away from darkness and evil walk away from the Democratic Party, which is turned on all the way Derek right now, in our time, god bless you all greetings in love, a'tall.

What you see going on with Donald Trump is accusation after accusation, after accusation, you know, and it's all lies. If you look at his history, he said seventy years of never being called a racist through a bigot. He was the first person to stick up for equal rights for homosexual people. He being he hired blots on homosexuals based on their capability to do a job, not I'm. He didn't care about their sexual preference. He said right there in Advocate magazine in 2001, before the Clintons did that he was for equal treatment of games, not preferential but equal, which is what every emergency line is just to be get an equal shot of things. He stood hired women for his construction sites, his for women. He had a woman designed the first Trump Tower, so she was the first person to ever build a skyscraper first female I should say the build a skyscraper was was hired by Trump, so he has a whole history of standing up for the black people, standing up for the Jewish people in Florida and all the different minorities for attending his clubs. People don't know the true history of the man and what he really did and what he stood up for over the years, because they just see his exterior and maybe the way he conducts himself no politician ever that I've read about and in my 54 years on earth has ever gone into a campaign and promised buh-buh-buh-buh-buh big long list of stuff and actually done they all say: they're gonna do everything, and then they do almost nothing he's the exact opposite he's literally stuck with every single thing that he said he was going to do he's done, which is remarkable from anyone's perspective, and this is why everyone is freaking out so bad at him. The best people listen to about the history of the Democrats as some of the African American or black people on here. Whatever word, we would term, we want to use I, say black I, don't say african-american, because then we'd go around saying: European, American and Irish German Swedish American, and you know it can get way out of control. The black people on here very articulate. They come on here and articulate beautifully the history of the Democratic Party, which I never knew. In my whole life. They were supported, Jim Crow, they supported the KKK is supported, keeping slaves, they support welfare, which sort of does keep people enslaved, and certainly some people need welfare and welfare is good and we should have welfare, but socialism doesn't work. It's never worked in any country, it didn't work by its inventors. The first Christians and acts in the Bible tried it and it didn't work even then, because it requires everyone to be honest and to share everything equally and no one's ever going to do that. There's always going to be the greedy that take for themselves. The modern Democratic Party is evil and the Republican Party has been evil. People need to research about Bohemian Grove, which is where Republicans and the movers and shakers of the world have gone for years and years and I, don't know where that time the Republicans for years allowed to, but we mean Grove and they actually literally have human sacrifice, rituals that take place and supposedly they're staged and it's a staged production, and it probably is, but the point is, is why would they do something like that? Why would people sit there rich, millionaire, billionaire heads of countries, heads of you know, corporations be out in the woods, is all meeting together hanging out and watching a mock ritual sacrifice before a giant owl statue Idol of Moloch, which is in the Bible about a thousand times not to worship. This is what they've done: there's pictures of Reagan and the Bush family and all these people. How are the Bohemian Grove down through the last decades of this century, they've been out there, so they've been dramatically spiritually evil for real and with the Democratic Party we find out that Obama and many of the other people followed. The teachings of Saul linski Hillary Clinton wrote her de master's thesis or whatever, whatever her highest educational paper that she wrote was on the teachings of the Saul Alinsky and Obama, followed Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals, and he gives credit to Lucifer as being the one that rebelled and gained his own Kingdom. The first great regret all you know so literally they run their party based on these ideals that were a Satanist formed them, and then you have John Podesta Tony, who are the biggest operators for the Democratic Party in Washington DC John Podesta was Bill and Hillary Clinton's chief of staff and was going to be Hillary's chief of staff and he's literally such a bad person that he's a not only just a Satanist but he's actually a pedophile and a cannibal, and they don't hide it. You can look inside, look on the internet and just look up type in Podesta art collection. You don't need to look in the pizza gate. You don't need to look at the dramatic reams and reams of WikiLeaks files and evil stuff about these people. You all you need to do is do Podesta hard collection and look what these people have hanging in their houses, the statues and the pictures on their walls. It's a child torture, it's a pornography. It's a mutilation, cannibalism, Satanism! This stuff is on there in their house on their walls. This is these are the worst kind of people that have ever been in this country and they're running things behind the scenes. This is why the Democratic Party is the way it is. It's actually possessed if you saw it with Peter struck the other day. These aren't people that are just bad or greedy people that want a little money. These are people that are actually so spiritual, evil, they're willing to ruin people they're willing to kill people, they're willing to start riots, they're willing to turn black against white they're willing to turn homosexual against homosexual husband against wife. You know: they're they're, just they're sowing the seeds of discord and dissent and hate, and this movement is the exact opposite of that. This is a beautiful movement of love and peace, and it's amazing. It's amazing what we read on here and seeing here that let testimony's you're so beautiful they make you cry. You hear so many people walking away from the hate walking away from this anger and this viciousness- and this is what needs to happen in the this enlightenment- needs to continuing to grow and it is growing it's turning into a beautiful spark of light, that's spreading through the world and spreading in our country and literally what I think we're gonna reach a million more and there'll, be a March and there'll be all these things. So this is beautiful and we're grateful to be a part of it and I have a longer version of this, and the longer version is going to be on YouTube, where I original one that did that keeps getting rejected, even though other people have ones that are happening online I'm here, my long half 25 minute, one is gonna, be on YouTube, where I'm a little more in depth on a few of these things, so I'll just sign off here and say we love you all and God bless you and we're glad that this movement is taking place and helping people to wake up and please walk away, walk away from hate, walk away from darkness and evil walk away from the Democratic Party, which is turned on all the way Derek right now, in our time, god bless you all greetings in love, a'tall. You walk away errs out there who are assumed to be the runaway movement, because it's running away like the runaway trump train now I think it's said, 140,000 that it's reached up I've been communicating with this site, since it started a little Easter when I found out about it, which was like July, 2nd, I, suppose I, don't know how long it's gone on, but I've done some letters that had a hard time being published through a series of mishaps and problems, and also now I've had my video line. That's gonna be on YouTube and I put a longer version. That's gonna be on YouTube. That was 25 minutes long. A lot of people have long ones on here, but mine was keeps getting rejected for some reason. So now, there's all of a sudden saying everyone's has to be shorter, so I'm making the short one with the timer on and I just have a lot of stuff to cover that I can talk about him. 54 years old, it was a Democrat. Most of my life I was in the Air Force at 17 years old until 21, and learned a lot about the government and a lot about the world and the way things work and when you're, on talking to people on this site, they're reading what people say in this site, you know a lot of the people are younger people who all they know is Obama and Bernie, and you know the more recent stuff that's gone out of our country. They're, not really aware of well they're, not aware of the history of this country very much at all a lot of times. You see this on the some of the newer shows, or they ask you to fight the Revolutionary War, who fought the Civil War. They don't know, you literally know almost nothing so um, it's very important for people to learn that there's a historical, political and, most importantly, spiritual element to all of this. My wife and I both have Lyme disease she's had it since 74 and I've had it since 94, and what I see happening with this walkaway movement is that people are very sort of in shock. They're they're surprised at the level of animosity and hatred, that's falling out of people at them in their own families, and this is something that we strangely are used to, because people with Lyme disease have their own line community it's all worldwide and when you have Lyme disease, it's very much like the early days of AIDS, where there's an extreme attack that goes along with it, where you're not just sick and dying or feeling bad you're, brutally attacked by the medical community by your family, you're, ostracized, you're, accused of thinking for how sick you are it's an amazing experience to go through, but it trains you in what spiritual warfare is we're experiencing in our society. Right now is an unparalleled spiritual war, that's taking place and it's very serious and it's very powerful, and this is why people are having such a strong reaction to this walkaway movement, because this is a movement of love and it's more a movement of seeing what's really going on. Where there's this, this strong brutal hatred towards trauma- and it's not just towards Republicans, it's more towards Trump, and if you really think about it, it's towards the women in his family and the kids in his family, and you know even little kids. So it's a you know. This is the stuff. That's it's pushing people over the edge where they can't take it anymore. Looking back I want to explain our walk away in my walk away. You know, like most people, I grew up believing the Democratic Party cared more about the poor. The Republicans I always knew were old, white rich warmongering. You know this was something that was kind of just known about Republicans, because that was what it was like in our lifetime. We had Nixon and we had Ford, and these people were freemasons. The founders of our country were freemasons, they weren't Christians. They were Christians at the surface, but underneath there were members of the secret society. This is something a lot of people, don't know about and understand, but it's really important because if you're gonna research this it's important to know what the history of our country is and it's built on, Freemasonry, which, at its core and its rut, isn't it as a worship of Egyptian deities back in time or even predating, that to a Syrian and Mesopotamian deities like the moon-god, it's unbelievable when you research this stuff, you find all this out. Romney and McCain, who are the two that ran against Obama Obama came along and deceived a lot of people, and even though he deceived people, he was a more peaceful person and then a column or character, even though I didn't agree with what he was doing. I still voted for him because even as a Roman Catholic, which is what we are obviously I'm, bringing up the spiritual aspect of this, because it's very important to see that this is a war and to see that how who's good who's bad McCain wanted to fight the whole world. He was ready to go to war with Syria Iran Iraq Afghanistan, China, North Korea I mean he would have had us fighting everyone. Then he had Willard Romney, whose name isn't met its Willard and he was just a horrible guy that just lied. Three four or five times in one sentence. He'd lie and he showed this horrible disdain caught on tape where he called people. You know that a certain percent, forty seven percent or whatever so he literally was bashing half the country, which then Hillary made the exact same mistake, and it's called you know a big chunk of the country deplorable, it's funny in a way, but this is what happened and so I don't regret. Voting for Obama, like a lot of people do because he was the lesser of two evils as a Catholic which I brought started to pro-life is usually the main cause. So there's literally Christians and there's literally Catholics, who will vote Republicans simply on the pro-life issue. Pro-Life is a huge, huge thing to open up. No one sane wants things to go back to the back-alley days and no one's saying wants to take away a woman's free will or purse any human beings free, but they also don't want to judge someone from being homosexual. It's wrong and you're, just not supposed to judge anyone you're not supposed to accept people that are evil, though, and that's different a way a person lives. Their life is not necessarily good or evil as long as they're not hurting other people, it's when you start hurting other people in lying and smearing and degrading and accusing is the word and Lucifer who's. The devil was called Satan by Jesus in the Bible when he called Lucifer Satan. The name Satan in his Aramaic tongue meant the accuser.

28,23NeTd3DMz8,what's going on America this is Kevin and Kevin's corner and it looks like people are walking away from the dim rattle I would sing the second verse but I don't know the worst I'm pretty sure it's just hallelujah all the way through but nonetheless you get the point okay yeah they're leaving they're walking away and they should cuz these boots are made for walkin that's just what they'll do one of these days demo rats they're gonna walk all over you let me get focused now the reason that this is horrible for the demo rats is because these people that are walking away leaving their testimonies are the worst people to walk away from the Democrats because see these people fit every stereotype every small interest group every identity politics category that the Democrats build their whole platform around see it would be one thing if people were walking away and there were upper-class rich white men you know all the libs would be like you know what how are you gonna walk away from something that you never was a part of in the first place you weren't really with us because your white privilege man you're not walking away we're kicking out or even as a black person you know a brother who might not have come from say hey you know the culture hate will you know didn't come from Beverly Hills or something like that they you know they they let you know well you know you can't walk away you know what you are you're still out to your own people man you which your your your your your Uncle Tom your cool all of that stuff they try to use those things to shame people like you know a per class white man even even upper class white women you know they they they just feel like you know you're doing your people disservice from walking weight you know what you are you're just being controlled by your husband you can't think for yourself but you have people of all races colors ethnicities sexual orientation I was watching some videos and it was some transgender people and they were just talking about how they felt like they have been manipulated all of these years by the Democratic Party they said they didn't see these are people that you can't sit back and say you know what they were never down with the Democrats anyway these were people who was out there social justice warriors crying after Hillary loss you know thrown a fit and then they start realizing that when it comes down to the left you are only accepted based on your loyalty to them see real friends they don't walk away from you just because you just disagree with them that's what they but the Democrats know see you're only a transgender if you support all of the transgender beliefs in their echo-chamber soon is one of them say you know what this is ridiculous why am i man I'm just walking around man for nothing cuz y'all told me I should be mad and as soon as they declare that then all of a sudden they don't want to be affiliated with them anymore same thing with black people now people are starting to realize what black people been going through all these years when they decide to leave the Democratic plantation immediately they they feel that they got a corner a market share of blackness so if you ain't down with the Democrats they take your black card they start calling y'all kind of name it schooling racist Uncle Tom well can't call you racist but you know with all all those other words they like to call us and now transgenders are starting to see that they're being persecuted for it the guy who started it the whole walk away movement he said that I saw him warned of judge Jeanine he said he went in to buy some recording equipment and they wouldn't even serve him and that that just shows how horrible the left is in this progressive movement because they talk about you know dictatorships that talk about oh you know what this is fascism and they practice the same stuff that they accuse the the right of doing and the right is very very tolerant when it comes down to embracing people of different races ethnicity sexual orientation it's not about all that stuff it's about how you respect everybody else and how you view a America and some of the values that we have I don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home I'm not here to chase you down until you know what you're you're not you're not right because you did this and you did that I'm like look man let me be but that's the difference see the left feel like they gotta walk around fine and victims and it just goes from one victim to another it's never okay we found enough victims guys let's go ahead and wrap it up no no they're going okay we're still out here safe searching for more victims and they go from one victim to the next and not only that they like to get in your business now why would you want to be a part of an organization a movement a party they want to get all in your business they want to get in your health care they want to get in your religion they want to get into your speech they want to get into your first and second Amendment they want to get into every element of your life they want to get into your brain and they say if you don't think like we think they can't just say we disagree you're evil you know what you're racist as it aful hugga for your all of these things you're not just a person who disagrees you're not just a person who comes up with logical practicing policies no you're an evil wicked person and then you wonder why people are walking away from the Democrats in droves and I'm so glad that they're waking up because the Democrats are full of garbage why would you want to be a part of them when all they do is walk around being mad for nothing they are the most angriest and tolerant people on the planet at this point and it's all being propagated by the left and when I say the left I'm not talking about the people remember the people running around are victims of this manipulation and these are the people a lot of them that are walking away they're opening their eyes and say man I have been manipulated I have been being used and they have been preying upon my anger my insecurities my fears they're creating all these narratives that they tell me I need to buy - they're telling me that I must think like this because I'm black or I'm gay or I'm a lesbian or a Jew they're telling me how to think and that is stinking thinking okay and I don't like no stinking thinking all right I'm an individual I can think what I want to think and I don't care if they call me all kind of names and the right isn't racing all of these people that are saying I'm waking up and I'm walking on over to the to the light I'm coming into the light okay so anyway I chuckle I laugh even though now they're trying to suppress it I know one person she did a video and now they're referencing that these must be Russian BOTS not all of these testimonies are true these are just the Russians once again everything's Russians it's the Russians they've gotten involving they're manipulating the system yeah they're doing a preemptive strike on the people who are walking away because they can't afford to take off they can't afford it to become a real movement cuz that messes up their our whole strategy remember outside of them telling you you're a victim you know what this is sexism this is racism this is xenophobia this is you know what I heard somebody say a phobia means it's an unhealthy unwarranted fear of something the stuff that they're trying to out fear homosexuals I don't fear illegal immigrants I don't fear anybody there you know and so they're running around creating fears you know fear is false evidence appearing real they're creating fears I'm just thinking logically just because I disagree with the legal immigration you know I'm not an illegal folk you know I'm none of those things just because maybe certain people's / lifestyle that they practice I might not practice that don't make me homophobic xenophobic or whatever it just makes me say well whatever suits you buddy might have at it I'm gonna do whatever I do but it doesn't have to come down to just because you disagree that must mean you're fearful of it I'm going you're just making up stuff winging it you're just looking for reasons to be mad and I think people are starting to wake up and say wait a minute I'm just walking around angry all the time how can you live your life like that how could you just wake up every day and say let me go find more problems be mad about and things just fuss about and you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna create all kind of trouble and I'm gonna stir up stuff and I'm gonna show up in people's jobs and I'm gonna go ahead and rest people and rest around and I'm gonna tell them how I feel and what needs to be done and how they thinking how evil they are but I'm not gonna give any solutions I'm not gonna give any solutions so why would anybody want to follow a party that that's the base of the operation just chaotic emotional angry just dominant wanna come in and tell you what to do how to spend your money take your money divvy it out the way they want to under some humanitarian guidelines and if you say no-oh-oh your class rich 1% yeah we can't have a debate we can't sit down and talk it out can we no because you're gonna shut it down by saying you can't tell me what to do or think because you're racist you're hopeful you're dumb you're whatever else I decide you are and if you don't think like me we're gonna kick you out of our little Club well you know what kicked me out the club I'll go start my own okay I don't follow by the rules anyway god bless you Kevin Kevin's corner keep walking people keep with big steps matter of fact forget walking

would sing the second verse but I don't know the worst I'm, pretty sure it's just hallelujah all the way through, but nonetheless you get the point: okay, yeah they're, leaving they're walking away and they should cuz. These boots are made for walkin. That's just what they'll do. One of these days, demo rats they're gonna, walk all over you. Let me get focused now the reason that this is horrible for the demo rats is because these people that are walking away, leaving their testimonies are the worst people to walk away from the Democrats because see these people fit every stereotype. Every small interest group, every identity, politics category, that the Democrats build their whole platform around see. It would be one thing if people were walking away and there were upper-class rich white men. You know all the libs would be like. You know what. How are you gonna walk away from something that you never was a part of in the first place you weren't really with us, because your white privilege man you're, not walking away we're kicking out or even as a black person. You know a brother who might not have come from, say: hey, you know the culture hate will, you know, didn't come from Beverly Hills or something like that. They you know they they let you know. Well, you know you can't walk away. You know what you are you're still out to your own people, man, you, which your your, your, your, your Uncle Tom, your cool. All of that stuff. They try to use those things to shame. People like you, know a per class white man, even even upper class white women. You know they they, they just feel, like you know, you're doing your people disservice from walking weight. You know what you are you're just being controlled by your husband. You can't think for yourself, but you have people of all races, colors ethnicities, sexual orientation, I was watching some videos and it was some transgender people and they were just talking about how they felt like they have been manipulated all of these years by the Democratic Party. They said they didn't see. These are people that you can't sit back and say you know what they were never down with the Democrats anyway, these were people who was out there. Social justice warriors crying after Hillary loss, you know, thrown a fit, and then they start realizing that when it comes down to the left, you are only accepted based on your loyalty to them, see real friends. They don't walk away from you just because you just disagree with them. That's what they, but the Democrats know see you're only a transgender. If you support all of the transgender beliefs in their echo-chamber soon is one of them say. You know what this is ridiculous. Why am I man, I'm just walking around man for nothing, cuz, y'all told me? I should be mad and as soon as they declare that, then all of a sudden, they don't want to be affiliated with them anymore, same thing with black people. Now people are starting to realize what black people been going through all these years when they decide to leave the Democratic plantation immediately, they they feel that they got a corner, a market share of blackness. So if you ain't down with the Democrats, they take your black card, they start calling y'all kind of name it. Schooling, racist Uncle, Tom. Well, can't call you racist, but you know with all all those other words they like to call us, and now transgenders are starting to see that they're being persecuted for it, the guy who started it the whole walk away movement. He said that I saw him warned of judge Jeanine. He said he went in to buy some recording equipment and they wouldn't even serve him and that that just shows how horrible the left is in this progressive movement because they talk about. You, know dictatorships that talk about. Oh, you know what this is fascism and they practice the same stuff that they accuse the the right of doing, and the right is very, very tolerant when it comes down to embracing people of different races, ethnicity, sexual orientation. It's not about all that stuff. It's about how you respect everybody else and how you view a America and some of the values that we have I, don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home I'm, not here to chase you down until you know what you're you're, not you're, not right, because you did this and you did that I'm like look man, let me be, but that's the difference see the left feel like they. Gotta walk around fine and victims, and it just goes from one victim to another. It's never! Okay. We found enough victims, guys, let's go ahead and wrap it up. No, no they're going okay, we're still out here, safe searching for more victims, and they go from one victim to the next and not only that they like to get in your business. Now. Why would you want to be a part of an organization? A movement a party they want to get all in your business, they want to get in your health care they want to get in your religion. They want to get into your speech. They want to get into your first and second Amendment. They want to get into every element of your life. They want to get into your brain and they say, if you don't think like, we think they can't just say we disagree you're evil. You know what you're racist as it aful hugga for your all of these things, you're, not just a person who disagrees you're, not just a person who comes up with logical practicing policies, no you're, an evil, wicked person, and then you wonder why people are walking away from the Democrats in droves and I'm so glad that they're waking up because the Democrats are full of garbage. Why would you want to be a part of them when all they do is walk around being mad for nothing? They are the most angriest and tolerant people on the planet. At this point and it's all being propagated by the left and when I say the left, I'm not talking about the people remember, the people running around are victims of this manipulation, and these are the people a lot of them that are walking away, they're, opening their eyes and say man, I have been manipulated, I have been being used and they have been preying upon. My anger, my insecurities my fears, they're, creating all these narratives that they tell me I need to buy - they're telling me that I must think like this, because I'm black or I'm, gay or I'm a lesbian or a Jew they're telling me how to think- and that is stinking thinking. Okay and I. Don't like no stinking thinking all right. I'm an individual I can think what I want to think and I don't care if they call me all kind of names and the right isn't racing all of these people that are saying I'm waking up and I'm walking on over to the to the light I'm coming into the light. Okay. So anyway, I chuckle I laugh even though now they're trying to suppress it. I know one person she did a video and now they're referencing that these must be Russian BOTS. Not all of these testimonies are true. These are just the Russians once again, everything's Russians, it's the Russians they've gotten involving they're, manipulating the system, yeah they're, doing a preemptive strike on the people who are walking away because they can't afford to take off. They can't afford it to become a real movement cuz that messes up their our whole strategy. Remember outside of them telling you you're a victim. You know what this is sexism. This is racism. This is xenophobia. This is you know what I heard somebody say. A phobia means it's an unhealthy unwarranted fear of something the stuff that they're trying to out fear homosexuals, I, don't fear illegal immigrants, I, don't fear anybody there, you know, and so they're running around creating fears. You know fear is false evidence appearing real they're, creating fears, I'm just thinking. Logically, just because I disagree with the legal immigration. You know I'm, not an illegal folk. You know I'm none of those things just because maybe certain people's / lifestyle that they practice I might not practice that don't make me homophobic, xenophobic or whatever it just makes me say well, whatever suits you buddy might have at it. I'm gonna do whatever I do, but it doesn't have to come down to just because you disagree. That must mean you're, fearful of it I'm going you're just making up stuff winging it you're, just looking for reasons to be mad and I. Think people are starting to wake up and say: wait a minute I'm just walking around angry all the time. How can you live your life like that? How could you just wake up every day and say? Let me go find more problems, be mad about and things just fuss about, and you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna create all kind of trouble and I'm gonna stir up stuff and I'm gonna show up in people's jobs and I'm gonna go ahead and rest people and rest around and I'm gonna tell them how I feel and what needs to be done and how they thinking how evil they are. But I'm not gonna, give any solutions: I'm not gonna, give any solutions. So why would anybody want to follow a party that that's the base of the operation? Just chaotic emotional, angry, just dominant wanna, come in and tell you what to do how to spend your money. Take your money divvy it out the way they want to under some humanitarian guidelines, and if you say, no-oh-oh your class rich, 1% yeah. We can't have a debate. We can't sit down and talk it out. Can we no because you're gonna shut it down by saying you can't tell me what to do or think because you're, racist you're hopeful, you're, dumb you're, whatever else I decide you are, and if you don't think like me, we're gonna kick you out of our little Club. Well, you know what kicked me out. The club I'll go start, my own okay, I, don't follow by the rules. Anyway, god bless you Kevin Kevin's corner keep walking. People keep with big steps. Matter of fact, forget walking, take off like Jesse Owens, okay I want to see some flow Joe I want to see folks running out of there like, like you, know the flash everybody just book. It see.

Um I did not vote for Trump didn't vote for Hillary for sure, so I didn't think so. I have no right to complain, of course, but I just um really wasn't happy with the things that Trump said so forth and so on and I was almost a little influenced by you know people's emotions because it affected me because I feel you know like okay, what's gonna happen, what's he going to do? Is it going to be terrible because that's what the news was telling us and I mean I still don't like some of the things he says, but guess what he's getting the job done and um I have a business that has grown in the past two to three years that I I can't even believe it. It's so unbelievable, so everything's great as far as I'm concerned, other than I mean everything economically is great, but everything else is terrible, but this group is so inspiring I. Don't even talk about politics anymore! On my Facebook page, like I, used to because I I don't feel comfortable talking about it, you either have somebody that is going to be extremely pissed off from the left or extremely pissed off from the right, because there seems to be no middle ground with anyone. Although this group is you know, everybody seems to be kind of in the middle, like everybody's on the same page and I. Think it's awesome, you know, and it's just it sucks- that I can't talk about politics anymore, which is such a passion of mine because of all of this I mean of all of the hate and I quit watching the news. I can't even watch the news anymore me, anxiety and I do watch some of Fox, yes, but for the most part, I'd just read up on stuff and really just hearing all these video testimonies, honest to God. It has just changed the course of how I feel, and it's given me hope again for this country. It really truly has because I know that there are way more good than bad. It always is the case. We just only see the bad, because that's all I want to show us so I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for inspiring me for being brave enough to stand up, walk away from what you don't believe in and to be able to freely think for yourself.

30,2AZvdO5MU9Y,hey guys it's um Kim guys I've got a nervous but I've been looking at this walkaway campaign and I'm just really really compelled to add my two cents to the fray I've watched the young brother who started the whole campaign I've seen him on Fox I heard him on judge Jeanine I looked at his video this morning just compelling us to post like if you're if you walked away from the Democratic Party or if you've been conservative to post these videos so that the left can quit lying about the movement is mostly BOTS so I just felt really compelled that I had to put my two sin in but I walked away guys back in 2000 and when I started to realize that the Democratic Party was just lying to black folks when I realized that it was Republicans who pushed through the Civil Rights Act I started learning a little bit more I became actually back in 95 when I first became a Christian I think that's what started opening to my eyes because I voted for Bill Clinton and I really believed in him but when he started lying you go to our face about Monica Lewinsky oh god I should think I had ice cream it was pretty good had some ice cream on my left but he was lying about Monica Lewinsky saying that he didn't have so I started opening my eyes and I started paying more attention to politics I'm a I always voted Democrat because that's what my mom was and she was very when it came to election day and her and my stepdad would get dressed up go to the polls so I always felt I've been voting since I was 18 I'm 57 now be 58 I voted in every presidential election the only one I missed this is how left I was I missed the 1980 election which really the first time I could have voted for a president and that's when Ronald Reagan want I felt so bad cause I feel personally responsible that I had helped him get elected and I really didn't know I just felt that way because I was told to feel that way that he was bad because he was conservative so I brought into that all the way up until I was almost 40 and when George Bush was the second one in 2001 he was running up into that point I had started doing a little reading and he said something on his stump speech that really really impacted me he said we have to get rid of the soft racism of low expectations I had already started to kind of move to the right I was looking at what affirmative action was doing I felt like it wasn't right like it was more of a hindrance to black people like anything that we got that was to our credit could always be suspect because we had help or had a disadvantage so fast forward to mm I started thinking about switching over when George Bush said what he said and I started paying attention really learning history that all the races in the South were Democrats that it was Democrats the Ku Klux Klan came from Democrats that Margaret Sanger who started playing parenthood did her first steep speech at a Ku Klux Klan rally that the President Woodrow Wilson had the clans doing a showing in the White House and he was one of the worst progressives I learned a lot you know start listening to Glenn Beck way back in the late 90s when he still had a little sanity and learned a lot just from him and start paying attention to history and learning and it just seemed right to me to become a Republican or conservative or I just knew that the Democrat Party and socialism and whatever they were representing just didn't fit with me and didn't fit with my spirit so but I've been a closeted Republican I mean those close to me know and I really don't even consider myself a Republican it's more I'm conservative even leaning a little bit libertarian but I see how these people on the left are crazy oh and the other thing listening to rush listening to rush just really really when I heard George Bush I start listening to Rush Limbaugh - back in 2000 and just listening to him and here you just tell the truth hey it was the same thing with me when I first heard about Rush and because I was a Democrat and let people tell me what to think I always thought he was bad until I start listening to him you know I thought he was racist everything that the Democrats try to tell you that people on the Left progresses whatever you want they're all the same with the exception of being a classical liberal I see a lot of classical liberals my stepdad was one who I think a very reasonable and you can have a discussion with him as a matter of fact here lately with the last election you know my family knows that I lean right I've had discussions and debates they're brainwashed they're thinking drinking the kool-aid - but I mean it really got bad when after the election my own little sister disowned me because I voted for Trump and I thought that was crazy and even now to this day our relationship hasn't gotten back to where it was because of how she felt I knew she was a big Hillary supporter but it never crossed my mind to ever think about not talking to her she took it personally that I voted for Donald Trump like she told me she literally felt like I didn't want my niece to have health care because I voted for Donald Trump and and this is a very smart intelligent woman and it just blew me away and said this day is still really hurt so I walked away way back in 2002 I've been a closeted Republican conservative libertarian whatever you say I just know I'm not a Democrat I'm not a progressive I don't agree with those policies I love Donald Trump of what he's doing for this country I'm an American who happens to be black that's just I just saw I relate and what Donald Trump is doing I love that he doesn't do identity takes because what he's doing is caring for Americans so anything that's good for Americans gonna be good for all Americans whether you're black white brown Asian Hispanic Latin whatever we want to call ourselves we're all Americans first and his policies are what matters and that's what I like I don't care about his personality or anything about that one thing I have no doubt about that number one he loved this country number two he only cares about Americans and putting Americans first I don't see how anybody can get anything racist from that the media lies the left-leaning media lies about everything I don't trust anything I haven't watched CNN in years don't care to watch it because I already know what they're gonna say MSNBC CBS I watched Fox you know like Hannity I loved just Janeane like Tucker Laura Ingraham I used to listen to her on the radio so I do when I watch cable news that's where I watch but I do get a lot of my information -

I've watched the young brother, who started the whole campaign. I've seen him on Fox I heard him on judge Jeanine I looked at his video this morning, just compelling us to post like if you're, if you walked away from the Democratic Party or if you've been conservative to post these videos so that the left can quit lying about. The movement is mostly BOTS, so I just felt really compelled that I had to put my two sin in, but I walked away guys back in 2000 and when I started to realize that the Democratic Party was just lying to black folks when I realized that it was Republicans who pushed through the Civil Rights Act I started learning a little bit more I became actually back in 95 when I first became a Christian I. Think that's what started opening to my eyes, because I voted for Bill, Clinton and I really believed in him. But when he started lying you go to our face about Monica Lewinsky, oh god, I should think I had ice cream. It was pretty good, had some ice cream on my left, but he was lying about Monica Lewinsky, saying that he didn't have so I started. Opening my eyes and I started paying more attention to politics. I'm a I always voted Democrat, because that's what my mom was and she was very when it came to election day and her and my stepdad would get dressed up. Go to the polls, so I always felt I've been voting since I was 18. I'm 57 now be 58. I voted in every presidential election. The only one I missed. This is how left I was I missed the 1980 election, which really the first time I could have voted for a president and that's when Ronald Reagan want I felt so bad cause. I feel personally responsible that I had helped him get elected and I really didn't know. I just felt that way, because I was told to feel that way that he was bad because he was conservative, so I brought into that all the way up until I was almost 40 and when George Bush was the second one in 2001 he was running up into that point. I had started doing a little reading and he said something on his stump speech. That really really impacted me. He said we have to get rid of the soft racism of low expectations. I had already started to kind of move to the right. I was looking at what affirmative action was doing. I felt like it wasn't right like it was more of a hindrance to black people, like anything that we got. That was to our credit, could always be suspect because we had help or had a disadvantage so fast forward to mm I started thinking about switching over when George Bush said what he said and I started. Paying attention really learning history that all the races in the South were Democrats, that it was Democrats. The Ku Klux Klan came from Democrats that Margaret Sanger, who started playing parenthood, did her. First steep speech at a Ku Klux Klan rally that the President Woodrow Wilson had the clans doing a showing in the White House, and he was one of the worst progressives. I learned a lot. You know start listening to Glenn Beck way back in the late 90s when he still had a little sanity and learned a lot just from him and start paying attention to history and learning, and it just seemed right to me to become a Republican or conservative or I just knew that the Democrat Party and socialism and whatever they were representing just didn't fit with me and didn't fit with my spirit. So but I've been a closeted Republican I mean those close to me know and I, really don't even consider myself a Republican, it's more I'm conservative, even leaning a little bit libertarian but I, see how these people on the left are crazy. Oh and the other thing listening to rush listening to rush just really really when I heard George Bush I start listening to Rush, Limbaugh - back in 2000 and just listening to him, and here you just tell the truth: hey. It was the same thing with me when I first heard about Rush and because I was a Democrat and let people tell me what to think I always thought he was bad until I start listening to him. You know I thought he was racist. Everything that the Democrats try to tell you that people on the Left progresses whatever you want, they're all the same, with the exception of being a classical liberal, I see a lot of classical liberals. My stepdad was one who I think a very reasonable and you can have a discussion with him as a matter of fact here lately with the last election. You know my family knows that I lean right, I've had discussions and debates they're, brainwashed, they're thinking, drinking the kool-aid -, but I mean it really got bad when, after the election, my own little sister disowned me because I voted for Trump and I thought that was crazy, and even now, to this day our relationship hasn't gotten back to where it was because of how she felt I knew she was a big Hillary supporter, but it never crossed my mind to ever think about not talking to her. She took it personally that I voted for Donald Trump. Like she told me, she literally felt like I, didn't want my niece to have health care, because I voted for Donald, Trump and- and this is a very smart, intelligent woman- and it just blew me away and said this day- is still really hurt. So I walked away way back in 2002 I've been a closeted Republican conservative, libertarian, whatever you say, I just know, I'm, not a Democrat I'm, not a progressive I, don't agree with those policies. I love, Donald, Trump of what he's doing for this country I'm an American who happens to be black, that's just I just saw I relate and what Donald Trump is doing. I love that he doesn't do identity takes because what he's doing is caring for Americans. So anything, that's good for Americans gonna be good for all Americans, whether you're black white brown, Asian Hispanic Latin, whatever we want to call ourselves we're all Americans first and his policies are what matters and that's what I like I, don't care about his personality or anything about that. One thing: I have no doubt about that number one. He loved this country number two. He only cares about Americans and putting Americans first I, don't see how anybody can get anything racist from that the media lies. The left-leaning media lies about everything, I, don't trust anything I haven't watched CNN in years. Don't care to watch it because I already know what they're gonna say: MSNBC CBS I watched Fox, you know like Hannity I loved just Janeane, like Tucker Laura Ingraham I used to listen to her on the radio, so I do when I watch, cable news, that's where I watch but I do get a lot of my information - from YouTube on the Internet, those youtubers I, love them they're, telling the truth. The Conservatives you know, even if they're, not conservative, I just want to hear the truth. Um so I do a lot of YouTube. So this was just me sharing my walk away. I was just compelled to do it. I'm waiting for my membership or my actually joined today, so I'm pre, recording this and hopefully it'll get uploaded once they approved me. But I walked away a long time ago back in 2000, so it's been 18 years, I've been in a closet. So maybe this is my coming-out. Maybe that's what I was in the video my coming out of the closet, the closet, Republican, a closet, conservative, but I just wanted to let my voice be heard in this as well. This has been something that's been inside of me for the last 18 years and I appreciate this moving movement. It's given me the opportunity to just say out loud what I've been wanting to say forever and god Bless America. God bless our president and I'm just praying for his success, because his policies are the right policies. I love, everybody, peace y'all! This is your girl, Kim, hey guys, it's um, Kim, guys, I've got a nervous, but I've been looking at this walkaway campaign and I'm just really really compelled to add my two cents to the fray.

The movement is mostly BOTS, so I just felt really compelled that I had to put my two sin in, but I walked away guys back in 2000 and when I started to realize that the Democratic Party was just lying to black folks when I realized that it was Republicans who pushed through the Civil Rights Act I started learning a little bit more I became actually back in 95 when I first became a Christian I. Think that's what started opening to my eyes, because I voted for Bill, Clinton and I really believed in him. But when he started lying you go to our face about Monica Lewinsky. Oh god, I should think I had ice cream. It was pretty good, had some ice cream on my left, but he was lying about Monica Lewinsky, saying that he didn't have so I started. Opening my eyes and I started paying more attention to politics. I'm a I always voted Democrat, because that's what my mom was and she was very when it came to election day and her and my stepdad would get dressed up. Go to the polls, so I always felt I've been voting since I was 18. I'm 57 now be 58. I voted in every presidential election. The only one I missed. This is how left I was I missed the 1980 election, which really the first time I could have voted for a president and that's when Ronald Reagan want I felt so bad cause. I feel personally responsible that I had helped him get elected and I really didn't know. I just felt that way, because I was told to feel that way that he was bad because he was conservative, so I brought into that all the way up until I was almost 40 and when George Bush was the second one in 2001 he was running up into that point. I had started doing a little reading and he said something on his stump speech. That really really impacted me. He said we have to get rid of the soft racism of low expectations. I had already started to kind of move to the right. I was looking at what affirmative action was doing. I felt like it wasn't right like it was more of a hindrance to black people, like anything that we got. That was to our credit, could always be suspect because we had help or had a disadvantage so fast forward to mm I started thinking about switching over when George Bush said what he said and I started. Paying attention really learning history that all the races in the South were Democrats, that it was Democrats. The Ku Klux Klan came from Democrats that Margaret Sanger, who started playing parenthood, did her. First steep speech at a Ku Klux Klan rally that the President Woodrow Wilson had the clans doing a showing in the White House, and he was one of the worst progressives. I learned a lot. You know start listening to Glenn Beck way back in the late 90s when he still had a little sanity and learned a lot just from him and start paying attention to history and learning, and it just seemed right to me to become a Republican or conservative or I just knew that the Democrat Party and socialism and whatever they were representing just didn't fit with me and didn't fit with my spirit. So but I've been a closeted Republican I mean those close to me know and I, really don't even consider myself a Republican, it's more I'm conservative, even leaning a little bit libertarian but I, see how these people on the left are crazy. Oh and the other thing listening to rush listening to rush just really really when I heard George Bush I start listening to Rush, Limbaugh - back in 2000 and just listening to him, and here you just tell the truth: hey. It was the same thing with me when I first heard about Rush and because I was a Democrat and let people tell me what to think I always thought he was bad until I start listening to him. You know I thought he was racist. Everything that the Democrats try to tell you that people on the Left progresses whatever you want, they're all the same, with the exception of being a classical liberal, I see a lot of classical liberals. My stepdad was one who I think a very reasonable and you can have a discussion with him as a matter of fact here lately with the last election. You know my family knows that I lean right, I've had discussions and debates they're, brainwashed, they're thinking, drinking the kool-aid -, but I mean it really got bad when, after the election, my own little sister disowned me because I voted for Trump and I thought that was crazy, and even now, to this day our relationship hasn't gotten back to where it was because of how she felt I knew she was a big Hillary supporter, but it never crossed my mind to ever think about not talking to her. She took it personally that I voted for Donald Trump. Like she told me, she literally felt like I, didn't want my niece to have health care, because I voted for Donald, Trump and- and this is a very smart, intelligent woman- and it just blew me away and said this day- is still really hurt. So I walked away way back in 2002 I've been a closeted Republican conservative, libertarian, whatever you say, I just know, I'm, not a Democrat I'm, not a progressive I, don't agree with those policies. I love, Donald, Trump of what he's doing for this country I'm an American who happens to be black, that's just I just saw I relate and what Donald Trump is doing. I love that he doesn't do identity takes because what he's doing is caring for Americans. So anything, that's good for Americans gonna be good for all Americans, whether you're black white brown, Asian Hispanic Latin, whatever we want to call ourselves we're all Americans first and his policies are what matters and that's what I like I, don't care about his personality or anything about that. One thing: I have no doubt about that number one. He loved this country number two. He only cares about Americans and putting Americans first I, don't see how anybody can get anything racist from that the media lies. The left-leaning media lies about everything, I, don't trust anything I haven't watched CNN in years. Don't care to watch it because I already know what they're gonna say: MSNBC CBS I watched Fox, you know like Hannity I loved just Janeane, like Tucker Laura Ingraham I used to listen to her on the radio, so I do when I watch, cable news, that's where I watch but I do get a lot of my information - from YouTube on the Internet, those youtubers I, love them they're, telling the truth. The Conservatives you know, even if they're, not conservative, I just want to hear the truth. Um so I do a lot of YouTube. So this was just me sharing my walk away. I was just compelled to do it. I'm waiting for my membership or my actually joined today, so I'm pre, recording this and hopefully it'll get uploaded once they approved me. But I walked away a long time ago back in 2000, so it's been 18 years, I've been in a closet. So maybe this is my coming-out. Maybe that's what I was in the video my coming out of the closet, the closet, Republican, a closet, conservative, but I just wanted to let my voice be heard in this as well. This has been something that's been inside of me for the last 18 years and I appreciate this moving movement. It's given me the opportunity to just say out loud what I've been wanting to say forever and god Bless America. God bless our president and I'm just praying for his success, because his policies are the right policies. I love, everybody, peace y'all! This is your girl, Kim, hey guys, it's um, Kim, guys, I've got a nervous, but I've been looking at this walkaway campaign and I'm just really really compelled to add my two cents to the fray. I've watched the young brother, who started the whole campaign. I've seen him on Fox I heard him on judge Jeanine I looked at his video this morning, just compelling us to post like if you're, if you walked away from the Democratic Party or if you've been conservative to post these videos so that the left can quit lying about.

32,2f9mVav3O70,hi everybody my name is Brie I've been watching everybody's videos and been really inspired by them so I decided to make my own I have always been a liberal very liberal probably far-left I was a Bernie supporter and I reluctantly voted for Trump because of what happened to Bernie in the primaries you know I remember the first Clinton and I just couldn't get behind Hillary Clinton so what made me start walking away was after the election the complete hysteria like the world was ending coming from the left from my side calling people names racist bigots low IQ voters you know and I'm like I voted for Trump I'm none of those things I'm not a racist I'm not a bigot another homophobe I have no problem with anybody you know live and let live that's what I've always thought and you know treating conservatives like second-class citizens and seeing it online sing it person I it I was disgusted by it I'm like I thought we were supposed to be tolerant and loving and that's not what I was seeing at all and so my brother who was a little further along in his journey than me sent me some video some YouTube videos on like social justice warriors which I used to be one completely demon didn't even know it I was completely part of that echo chamber you know sharing just stupid articles and you know thinking America was the worst country in the world you know colonialization all of that you know when I had no idea where that actually came from and so I started researching and realizing that a lot of the things I thought and a lot of things I believed were Marxist straight up Karl Marx I read Karl Marx you know started real reading history and I'm embarrassed to say you know supporting a socialist and not even knowing what that meant and how it's been horrendous for a lot of countries you know I read Mao's Great Leap Forward Gulag Archipelago about what happened in Russia you know I came across Jordan Peterson and ret you know listened to a ton of his YouTube videos and just realized what I was spewing out and how that is going to end up tearing the country apart because it's all oppressor vs. oppressed and it's not helpful for anybody it makes me really sad actually because if you're always thinking your victim then there's nothing you can do and you're telling people of color and gay people that they're victims you know saying you right out of the gate you have no shot I just think it's sad and I am NOT for it and I am glad that I've sort of seen the light because you know like Jordan Peterson says you know clean up your own room before you know get your own life in order before you go out and try to change the world and so that's what I've taken on for myself it's just how can I make my small little world better my neighborhood you know be the mom that all the kids can come over to her house you know watch out for each other you know just within your small little microcosm of the world because typing on a keyboard and being nasty to people is not going to help anybody it's just gonna make the climate you know worse and another thing I realize this conservatives aren't evil they just have a different way of looking at things and when you just assign you know evil bad to somebody just because of an opinion you'll never listen to what they have to say and so I've really you know once I start educating myself realized that you know we are all a human we are all just on our own path most of us love our families we just want the best for everybody and so what if we have different opinions on policy I won't be judging anybody for that anymore and but I and I also won't be getting on the calling liberals name trains either because I you know I see it from both sides that doesn't help you know so all I can do is educate myself on issues and try to look at both sides I'm definitely landing more classical liberal now you know moderate centrist on the right on a lot of stuff now you know pro-second amendment Pro free speech which is actually a conservative thing now crazy should we should all want that you know reading history like I said helps to know where we came from you know what we fought for it's it's really important yes but this has been very humbling but I have hope and it starts with each one of us just doing what we can in our little areas I mean so I guess yeah that's all we can do and yeah I won't be voting for a party that calls everybody racists and Nazis and I'm hoping the hysteria will die down because it's really disheartening you know I can't this is a second YouTube Facebook channel because I can't even go on my regular Channel this you know my facebook feed is just cancer it's just people hating on each other I'm not gonna have I I like people when I'm in a you know when you're around people face to face they're nice people are generally good you get on social media and it's just a cesspool I can't even do Twitter yeah so I'm just not gonna I'm not going to do it this campaign has sort of made me hopeful because reading people's comments and seeing that people can have a dialogue with each other even though you know maybe somebody's protip pro-choice pro-life they're not being awful to each and that's how we should be and that's you know I'm hoping that we can get there so anyways keep up the good work everybody I really enjoy

33,2foDTJ4dBp4,hello my name is Melinda riling I'm from Alabama I just wanted to tell everyone I wanted to be a part of this group and I just love everybody's stories so I just want to briefly just tell you a little bit about my story and my background I am my husband had a 32 year career in the military so I witnessed I got an opportunity to witness the military being totally destroyed in the Obama years I can tell you that during the time when Obama was being was elected president I was I was optimistic thinking wow you know he was not just black he was white as well and he was in a better position than anyone ever could have been to brought this country together but what I witnessed was a person who failed miserably he divided our country like I had never seen before I'm actually the same age as President Obama and I can and I can tell you in my lifetime I had never seen or felt such a division and racism ever in my lifetime I am being that my husband like I mentioned was in the military we had an opportunity we got invited to the White House to mark the end of the Iraq war there was 75 Iraqi vets that were invited so I got to meet President Obama and his wife and I can honestly tell you that night that we were all in that room like Obama did not even feel comfortable he was the first one it was the last one to come in and the first one to leave you could tell he was in water he was not comfortable in I during the Obama years all I could see was all all the divisions and how I couldn't even I wasn't even sure what side was he on I felt like you know Bergdahl giving away five of our are giving away five prisoners for a guy who deserted his post and who gives money to our enemies it just seemed like I didn't know what his agenda was but it did come to my obviously I could tell he wasn't I never felt he was on our side I didn't know I couldn't I didn't I felt there was something or somebody behind him and as as the end of the as the end of his term came it just couldn't come quick enough I didn't even feel safe in my country anymore I felt like I felt like we were being sold out and then here comes Hillary if it couldn't get worse than Bo Bhama we could go on and on and on about Hillary and who how anyone in the world could have ever thought where we would be now if Hillary would have been elected she would have sold us to the highest bidder and thank goodness for Donald Trump he is the one who has exposed all the crookedness that was going on that we would have never known about the media has covered everything up and if it wasn't for Donald Trump we wouldn't even know any of this I can honestly tell you I did not know if I was a Republican or a Democrat before the 2016 election but I can sure tell you now I know I am never gonna be a Democrat and thank you for Donald Trump I remember when he came down the escalator I never was so excited about a candidate I watched him I could I watch all of his rallies in fact I went to two of his rallies it was one of the most exciting events I've been to and it is was everything he would always say the people were lined up outside there were people everywhere we were in line for five hours just to get in I saw the excitement it was a movement and I kept wondering why are the wire the news media reporting that he was down in the polls it just didn't make sense what I saw how people were talking about but people were going through to go see him and his message the way the the way CNN and MSNBC would report his message it wasn't at all what he was saying he loved african-americans he loved the Mexican community they would take clips out of context and they had an agenda and that agenda was they wanted Obama's administration heat they wanted his his agenda to continue is what they wanted you know I grew up in the days when we had Walter Cronkite and when Walter Cronkite when he would say at the end of every every news she would say and that's the way it is and we knew when he said and that's the way it is that's the way it was we don't know that anymore we don't I don't trust any of the media anymore and we would have not known any of this without Donald Trump so when the 2016 November when that of when the election on November 8th 2016 I stayed up the entire night and I can honestly tell you when Donald Trump finally came out and they've said he was president I broke down and cried I felt like we had dodged a bullet and I I think God was involved in that and I will always think that but I see this movement and I am so happy for this because I think more and more people are waking up to what we all of us none of us knew and we wouldn't be here without Donald Trump so I just want to thank everybody I've enjoyed all your your testimonies and your stories and I look forward to you seeing more of them anyway goodbye,"Hello, my name is Melinda riling I'm from Alabama I just wanted to tell everyone. I wanted to be a part of this group and I just love everybody's stories, so I just want to briefly just tell you a little bit about my story and my background. I am my husband. Had a 32 year career in the military, so I witnessed I got an opportunity to witness the military being totally destroyed in the Obama years. I can tell you that during the time when Obama was being was elected, president I was I was optimistic. Thinking wow. You know he was not just black, he was white as well and he was in a better position than anyone ever could have been to brought this country together. But what I witnessed was a person who failed miserably. He divided our country, like I, had never seen before I'm, actually, the same age as President, Obama and I can and I can tell you in my lifetime. I had never seen or felt such a division and racism ever in my lifetime. I am being that my husband, like I mentioned, was in the military. We had an opportunity. We got invited to the White House to mark the end of the Iraq war. There was 75 Iraqi vets that were invited, so I got to meet President Obama and his wife and I can honestly tell you that night that we were all in that room like Obama did not even feel comfortable. He was the first one. It was the last one to come in and the first one to leave you could tell he was in water. He was not comfortable in I during the Obama years. All I could see was all all the divisions and how I couldn't even I wasn't even sure. What side was he on I felt, like you know, Bergdahl, giving away five of our are giving away five prisoners for a guy who deserted his post and who gives money to our enemies. It just seemed like I didn't know what his agenda was, but it did come to my obviously I could tell he wasn't I never felt he was on our side. I didn't know, I couldn't I didn't I felt there was something or somebody behind him and as as the end of the as the end of his term, came it just couldn't come quick enough. I didn't even feel safe. In my country, anymore, I felt like I felt like we were being sold out and then here comes Hillary. If it couldn't get worse than Bo Bhama, we could go on and on and on about Hillary and who, how anyone in the world could have ever thought where we would be now if Hillary would have been elected, she would have sold us to the highest bidder and, thank goodness for Donald Trump. He is the one who has exposed all the crookedness that was going on that we would have never known about. The media has covered everything up and if it wasn't for Donald Trump, we wouldn't even know any of this. I can honestly tell you. I did not know if I was a Republican or a Democrat before the 2016 election, but I can sure. Tell you now I know. I am never gonna, be a Democrat and thank you for Donald Trump I. Remember when he came down the escalator I never was so excited about a candidate I watched him. I could I watch all of his rallies. In fact, I went to two of his rallies. It was one of the most exciting events I've been to, and it is was everything he would always say. The people were lined up outside. There were people everywhere we were in line for five hours. Just to get in I saw the excitement. It was a movement and I kept wondering. Why are the wire the news media reporting that he was down in the polls? It just didn't make sense what I saw how people were talking about, but people were going through to go, see him and his message the way. The the way CNN and MSNBC would report his message. It wasn't at all what he was saying. He loved african-americans, he loved the Mexican community. They would take clips out of context and they had an agenda and that agenda was they wanted Obama's administration heat they wanted. His his agenda to continue is what they wanted. You know: I grew up in the days when we had Walter Cronkite and when Walter Cronkite, when he would say at the end of every every news she would say and that's the way it is and we knew when he said and that's the way it is that's the way it was. We don't know that anymore. We don't I, don't trust any of the media anymore and we would have not known any of this without Donald Trump. So when the 2016 November, when that of when the election on November, 8th, 2016 I stayed up the entire night and I can honestly tell you when Donald Trump finally came out and they've said he was president I broke down and cried I felt like we had dodged a bullet and I I. Think God was involved in that, and I will always think that, but I see this movement and I am so happy for this, because I think more and more people are waking up to what we all of us. None of us knew- and we wouldn't be here without Donald Trump, so I just want to thank everybody. I've enjoyed all your your testimonies and your stories and I look forward to you seeing more of them anyway. Goodbye."
34,2hgXR_aQZNI,[Music] i want to share my walk away story with you guys in hopes that it might help somebody else walk away uh or help somebody else just feel like they've been validated because that's what this movement has done for me so growing up as a kid my dad was the type of person who just didn't share their political views back then nobody really talked about what they believed in or who they voted for and when i turned 18 it was kind of a rite of passage uh you know when i went to vote for the first time my dad you know outed that he was a conservative uh you know and and growing up i've i always felt a sense of pride uh you know especially with the star-spangled banner and the pledge of allegiance you know they they even played the star spangled banner every morning in school and we said the pledge of allegiance and i remember having that sense of pride uh for being an american and then 9 11 happened when i was a junior in high school and i remember that feeling and it was the first time that i really didn't feel safe in america um it was a scary day it was a scary time and you know i remember those times i remember you know why that war started and in this war that's gone on for so long it seems like it doesn't have an ending so you know i was a democrat because i didn't want i didn't really like my dad's values i guess i was young kind of rebellious so of course you know i didn't want to just go with what he said so i i became a democrat you know i thought it was the party of acceptance and and that's who i am as a person i accept everyone as long as they don't do anything to me i don't i don't care about you know the color of your skin or or who you choose to worship and and have faith in and i don't care who you love i love everyone uh the same we're we're all americans we're all humans and so i thought that's what the democratic party was about so i voted for obama the first term i did not vote at all the second term for him i didn't agree he didn't bring the hope and change i saw a lot of things that i didn't like but it still didn't you know kind of link that to the democratic party i just thought okay well hopefully in 2016 we'll have a better candidate well we didn't so i didn't vote in that election either because i was a democrat and i really didn't know about trump i thought maybe um you know he he was just playing a game or you know whatever i mean the media coverage about him i believed all of the stuff they were saying so you know after he was elected though i started to realize that you know some of the things that they were saying just weren't true and i started to really see the attacks and not just the attacks on trump the attacks on people who supported trump and for me i was like hey you know that that's not the way that we're supposed to be thinking that's not what we stand for and and why are we attacking these people but they're not attacking us not as much anyway and they're not being violent and there's not these hate groups uh forming uh of trump supporters right and so i really started to listen to what trump was actually saying and i started to really start to agree with what he was saying but i thought maybe i was a little crazy i was really really scared uh to to debate anybody or talk about any of it until i saw brandon's walk away video and it touched me deep down in my soul because he really validated everything that i had been feeling he validated that it's okay to walk away from something that you just don't believe in and so after i saw his video i was so excited uh you know the first thing i did was call my dad and tell him hey i'm not you know i'm not a democrat anymore i'm going to register as a you know a a conservative and i was super excited uh you know to kind of join this movement and start talking to people but when i started talking to people they started treating me horribly calling me names calling me a racist i don't have a racist bone in my body uh you know it's just all kinds of really vile things and so this group the people in this this community really uh in the walk away campaign they really made me feel validated and i have never felt so much love and acceptance uh and and had good debates with people ever uh before meeting people in this this community and it's been amazing amazing i've met some such good friends and we are seeing the democratic party just go insane like some of the things that they are saying and doing it's just crazy and and they're acting like children and i just think that we need better we deserve better and it really feels like the democratic party now is really just against america all together and what we stand for and i i look back and i remember that pride and i remember being proud uh and i haven't felt that in a long time until i went to a trump rally and i actually got to meet brandon there and he is the most genuine person ever the i mean he's just amazing he's real uh so when i was at when we were at the trump rally i felt that feeling of being patriotic again i felt that feeling of being proud against to be an american and that's something that i don't i don't want to lose and i don't want to let go so that's my walk away story and my walk with story is it doesn't matter who you are to this this group of people uh that have decided to walk away it doesn't matter you're you can we all have different views and we all have different opinions about things and you know we all we all are different humans we're different people with with our own brains and we can think for ourselves and the one thing that i can say about this community and the people that i choose to walk with now is that even if we don't agree we can agree to disagree and we can have a good you know healthy debate and we can move on it's not the end of friendships or the end of you know the world if you don't agree with someone so my walk with story is that anybody in here that's feeling uh you know they're you're losing family members or you're losing friends and you you feel alone in this just know that there myself and a whole lot of other amazing people in this community are here for you and we walk with you and we'll continue to walk with you but guys we have to get out there and fight okay brandon cannot do this alone and we have to make sure that trump gets his second term because y'all if they get control and power now we're gonna be in a lot of trouble so we all have to do our part we have to make these testimonial videos we have to go out there and talk to people we have to really push this campaign because without us this campaign doesn't run because he cannot do it all by himself so that's my walk away story and my walk with story uh and and i love all of you guys and i hope uh soon that all of us can feel that patriotic spirit again and be proud to say that we live in america [Music] you,"[Music], I want to share my walk away story with you guys in hopes that it might help somebody else walk away, uh or help. Somebody else just feel like they've been validated because that's what this movement has done for me so growing up as a kid. My dad was the type of person who just didn't share their political views back then nobody really talked about what they believed in or who they voted for and when I turned 18 it was kind of a rite of passage uh. You know when I went to vote for the first time. My dad, you know outed that he was a conservative uh, you know and and growing up I've. I always felt a sense of pride uh. You know, especially with the star-spangled banner and the pledge of allegiance. You know they. They even played the star spangled banner every morning in school and we said the pledge of allegiance and I remember having that sense of pride uh for being an american and then 9 11 happened when I was a junior in high school, and I remember that feeling- and it was the first time that I really didn't feel safe in america um. It was a scary day. It was a scary time and you know I remember those times. I remember you know why, that war started and in this war that's gone on for so long. It seems like it doesn't have an ending. So you know I was a democrat because I didn't want. I didn't really like my dad's values. I guess I was young kind of rebellious. So, of course you know I didn't want to just go with what he said. So I I became a democrat. You know I thought it was the party of acceptance and and that's who I am as a person. I accept everyone as long as they don't do anything to me. I don't I don't care about. You know the color of your skin or or who you choose to worship and and have faith in, and I don't care who you love. I love everyone uh the same, we're we're all americans we're all humans, and so I thought that's what the democratic party was about. So I voted for obama, the first term. I did not vote at all the second term for him I didn't agree, he didn't bring the hope and change. I saw a lot of things that I didn't like, but it still didn't. You know kind of link that to the democratic party I just thought: okay. Well, hopefully, in 2016 we'll have a better candidate. Well, we didn't so. I didn't vote in that election either, because I was a democrat and I really didn't know about trump. I thought maybe um. You know he. He was just playing a game or you know whatever I mean the media coverage about him. I believed all of the stuff they were saying so you know after he was elected, though I started to realize that you know some of the things that they were saying just weren't true and I started to really see the attacks and not just the attacks on trump the attacks on people who supported trump and for me I was like hey. You know that that's not the way that we're supposed to be thinking, that's not what we stand for and and why are we attacking these people but they're not attacking us not as much anyway and they're not being violent and there's not these hate groups uh forming uh of trump supporters right, and so I really started to listen to what trump was actually saying, and I started to really start to agree with what he was saying. But I thought maybe I was a little crazy. I was really really scared uh to to debate anybody or talk about any of it until I saw brandon's walk away video and it touched me deep down in my soul because he really validated everything that I had been feeling. He validated that it's okay, to walk away from something that you just don't believe in and so after I saw his video, I was so excited uh. You know. The first thing I did was call my dad and tell him hey. I'm not. You know, I'm not a democrat anymore, I'm going to register as a you know, a a conservative and I was super- excited uh. You know to kind of join this movement and start talking to people, but when I started talking to people they started. Treating me horribly calling me names calling me a racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body uh. You know it's just all kinds of really vile things, and so this group, the people in this this community really uh in the walk away campaign. They really made me feel validated and I have never felt so much love and acceptance, uh and and had good debates with people ever uh before meeting people in this this community- and it's been amazing amazing. I've met some such good friends and we are seeing the democratic party just go insane like some of the things that they are saying and doing it's just crazy and and they're acting like children, and I just think that we need better. We deserve better and it really feels like the democratic party. Now is really just against america all together and what we stand for, and I I look back and I remember that pride and I remember being proud uh and I haven't felt that in a long time until I went to a trump rally and I actually got to meet brandon there and he is the most genuine person ever the I mean he's just amazing he's real uh. So when I was at when we were at the trump rally, I felt that feeling of being patriotic again, I felt that feeling of being proud against to be an american and that's something that I don't. I don't want to lose and I don't want to let go so. That's my walk away story and my walk with story. Is it doesn't matter who you are to this? This group of people uh that have decided to walk away? It doesn't matter you're, you can. We all have different views and we all have different opinions about things, and you know we all. We all are different humans, we're different people with with our own brains, and we can think for ourselves and the one thing that I can say about this community and the people that I choose to walk with now. Is that even if we don't agree, we can agree to disagree and we can have a good. You know healthy debate and we can move on. It's not the end of friendships or the end of you know the world. If you don't agree with someone, so my walk with story is that anybody in here that's feeling uh, you know they're you're, losing family members or you're losing friends, and you, you feel alone in this, just know that there myself and a whole lot of other amazing people in this community are here for you and we walk with you and we'll continue to walk with you, but guys we have to get out there and fight okay. Brandon cannot do this alone and we have to make sure that trump gets his second term because y'all, if they get control and power. Now we're gonna be in a lot of trouble. So we all have to do our part. We have to make these testimonial videos, we have to go out there and talk to people. We have to really push this campaign because without us, this campaign doesn't run because he cannot do it all by himself. So that's my walk away story and my walk with story. Uh and- and I love all of you guys- and I hope uh soon- that all of us can feel that patriotic spirit again and be proud to say that we live in america [Music]. You."
35,2mF1zCotWXk,what's up guys you know what so I can't leave this walkaway campaign alone I want to capitalize while you know strike while the iron is hot I didn't want to include this in my video yesterday just because I didn't want it to be too long but there is one other huge elephant in the room as far as reasons why I walked away from the Democratic Party and I will never ever vote for the Democratic Party again and that reason is the myth that the party switched at some point along history in America that the Democratic Party and Republican Party magically did a big switch and the Democrats the bad guys suddenly became the good guys and the Republicans were the good guys and went from the good guys to be in the bad guys that southern strategy that Richard Nixon wanted to campaign in the south just to be competitive is a myth and the fact that I was taught that in school knowing that the facts are out there that the party's never switched is it just pisses me off you know it's just a further validation that the public school system is failed the fact that the government controls the indoctrination they control the curriculum therefore they control the narrative you know it makes you wonder what our kids learning today that we're gonna see down the road is a lie they're gonna wake up and realize wow I was duped they told me Donald Trump was a fascist they told me Barack Obama was one of the greatest presidents in history kids could very well be learning that right now I don't have kids right now but when I do you best believe I'll either be homeschooling them or sending them to private school or charter schools something else they're not going to public school just because it's it's such a fallacy that you know you can teach someone whatever you want them to learn and the parents have no say-so in it you know the curriculum is all messed up so anyway I don't want to get off on the tangent I want to talk about how the Democrat and Republican Party never switched and I don't need all of the dates and all the historical facts for it because it's just so plain to see you know how about this we all know the Republican Party was founded in 1854 in opposition to slavery right to keep it from expanding to the West and you know the civil the civil war happened as a result of it and they won and the Republican Party ported the 13 14 and 15 amendments for slaves you know free in the slaves making them citizens allowing them to vote the Democratic Party was against it against all three of those amendments right then you have the first black politician ever was Republican Martin Luther King was a Republican you know the only reason that there was a switch was the black voter switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party so the only strategy that really happened was the welfare strategy that's right the LBJ Act I believe it was 1964 the Great Society act where he realized okay well blacks are voting now so that means that their vote makes a difference we have to figure out a way to get them I'm probably butchering the quote but he pretty much said you know I'll have those in words vote Democrat for the next 200 years we have to give him something but not enough to make a difference so insert the Great Society welfare act and then ever since that Welfare Act single motherhood in the black community is up like 73 percent since the 1960s also the Planned Parenthood you know Margaret Sanger was like a lady Ku Klux Klan member and she talked about eugenics and how black people need to be controlled by weeds these are all facts that you guys can look up you know for anybody that's gonna come in the comments section talk about this walk away movement there's people bragging about going from Democrat to Republican it's not even about that it's about breaking away from the narratives you know detaching yourself from your victimhood status the sacred cows status has been given to you by the Democrats and become a sovereign free-thinking individual that you were born to be it's your divine purpose to be a free-thinking independent person so back to this whole Democrat Republican switch right so you had Margaret Sanger with Planned Parenthood which by the way Planned Parenthood's are mostly in minority communities go look across all of America they're mostly in minority communities eugenics is a real thing they're actually doing eugenics in Iceland right now but eugenics in America was used to you know exterminate the black race and with the Welfare Act that was passed by LBJ you know that got black people voting Democrat but the difference is they had to get the parent out of the home the father out of the home so what did that do that means kids were growing up without a parent without their father and then you incentivize single mothers to marry the government and then fathers weren't able to get jobs they were locked up and then insert Bill Clinton in the nineties with his crime bill act supported by Democrats not supported by Republicans see it's coincidence right right you're gonna say the party switch yet the Republicans have had their fingerprints all over everything having to do with freedom they've always been the party of freedom the Democratic Party has always been the party of slavery Jim Crow KKK all the segregation laws you know they voted against all of the civil rights legislation they filibustered stuff you know that filibuster rule was made famous by Democrats you know so Bill Clinton with his crime bill locked up more black men than any other president in United States history okay so the I mean the historical facts are there but if people want to deny the historical facts okay let's talk about modern-day Democratic Party modern-day slavery modern-day slave plantations okay so use the eye test go to any mostly black Democrat run city you know your Cleveland your Chicago Detroit Baltimore Philadelphia Memphis Oakland their [ __ ] cities I mean let's call it what it is I mean these cities have all the elements of a modern-day slave plantation you have your Democratic mayor your poverty pimp your Maxine Waters these are the gatekeepers these are the these are the plantation owners you know or plantation masters they're pretty much just running the show they come out get your vote every four years or every two years and they talk about what they're gonna give you while also smearing Republicans talking about Republicans want to take away your freedom I want to take away your your handouts your programs your housing your food Republicans all they want to do is suggest that you're smart enough to do it on your own you don't need the government but black people their minds have been and not just black people I mean Hispanics suit pretty much anyone that's below the poverty line living in one of these cities they felt like the Democrats are really for them so they follow that narrative they believe into it they're a sacred cow they're part of the group they're part of the identity group works like you're the victim vote for me I'll make sure you have food stamps we're gonna get you reparations people eat that up man people eat it up but the modern-day slave plantation has all the elements you have the slave master which is a congresswoman like Maxine Waters or mayor you have your Al Sharpton's you have your young poverty pimps then you have substandard housing you have your handouts which is pretty much just like master giving out the scraps giving out food masters taking good care of you then it's overrun with police you know locking people up there's a lot of crime you don't have fathers in the homes you have Planned Parenthood on every corner you have failing infrastructure in these cities and most of them had Democratic mayor's since like the 40s the 50s the 60s so you tell me if the party's really switch I can't tell because if you're looking at every one of these cities I just mentioned how can you say that the parties actually switched and Democrats are for the people you know and now they've found their new sacred count they've moved on from black people Democrats are so over black people their new sacred cow their new residual voting bloc that they're trying to finesse is the illegal immigrants and what are they selling they're selling come on over here they're using that big welfare magnet bringing people up from Central and South America knowing they're gonna go on welfare right away they're gonna have kids here they're gonna bring kids over they want instant amnesty for them because they know that that's gonna build a residual voting bloc for them that is all they want to do so I could never vote for Democrats ever again and don't ever talk to me about how the party switched if the party switched it would be so evident these cities that are run by Democrats would be socialist utopias they would just be utopias there'd be trees sprouting everywhere you'd be never a cloudy day in Cleveland jobs would be booming schools would be the best in the nation no instead it's some of the worst in the nation what's up guys you know what so I can't leave this walkaway campaign alone I want to capitalize while you know strike while the iron is hot I didn't want to include this in my video yesterday just because I didn't want it to be too long but there is one other huge elephant in the room as far as reasons why I walked away from the Democratic Party and I will never ever vote for the Democratic Party again and that

want to capitalize while you know strike while the iron is hot I didn't want to include this in my video yesterday just because I didn't want it to be too long but there is one other huge elephant in the room as far as reasons why I walked away from the Democratic Party and I will never ever vote for the Democratic Party again and that reason is the myth that the party switched at some point along history in America that the Democratic Party and Republican Party magically did a big switch and the Democrats the bad guys suddenly became the good guys and the Republicans were the good guys and went from the good guys to be in the bad guys that southern strategy that Richard Nixon wanted to campaign in the south just to be competitive is a myth and the fact that I was taught that in school knowing that the facts are out there that the party's never switched is it just pisses me off you know it's just a further validation that the public school system is failed the fact that the government controls the indoctrination they control the curriculum therefore they control the narrative you know it makes you wonder what our kids learning today that we're gonna see down the road is a lie they're gonna wake up and realize wow I was duped they told me Donald Trump was a fascist they told me Barack Obama was one of the greatest presidents in history kids could very well be learning that right now I don't have kids right now but when I do you best believe I'll either be homeschooling them or sending them to private school or charter schools something else they're not going to public school just because it's it's such a fallacy that you know you can teach someone whatever you want them to learn and the parents have no say-so in it you know the curriculum is all messed up so anyway I don't want to get off on the tangent I want to talk about how the Democrat and Republican Party never switched and I don't need all of the dates and all the historical facts for it because it's just so plain to see you know how about this we all know the Republican Party was founded in 1854 in opposition to slavery right to keep it from expanding to the West and you know the civil the civil war happened as a result of it and they won and the Republican Party ported the 13 14 and 15 amendments for slaves you know free in the slaves making them citizens allowing them to vote the Democratic Party was against it against all three of those amendments right then you have the first black politician ever was Republican Martin Luther King was a Republican you know the only reason that there was a switch was the black voter switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party so the only strategy that really happened was the welfare strategy that's right the LBJ Act I believe it was 1964 the Great Society act where he realized okay well blacks are voting now so that means that their vote makes a difference we have to figure out a way to get them I'm probably butchering the quote but he pretty much said you know I'll have those in words vote Democrat for the next 200 years we have to give him something but not enough to make a difference so insert the Great Society welfare act and then ever since that Welfare Act single motherhood in the black community is up like 73 percent since the 1960s also the Planned Parenthood you know Margaret Sanger was like a lady Ku Klux Klan member and she talked about eugenics and how black people need to be controlled by weeds these are all facts that you guys can look up you know for anybody that's gonna come in the comments section talk about this walk away movement there's people bragging about going from Democrat to Republican it's not even about that it's about breaking away from the narratives you know detaching yourself from your victimhood status the sacred cows status has been given to you by the Democrats and become a sovereign free-thinking individual that you were born to be it's your divine purpose to be a free-thinking independent person so back to this whole Democrat Republican switch right so you had Margaret Sanger with Planned Parenthood which by the way Planned Parenthood's are mostly in minority communities go look across all of America they're mostly in minority communities eugenics is a real thing they're actually doing eugenics in Iceland right now but eugenics in America was used to you know exterminate the black race and with the Welfare Act that was passed by LBJ you know that got black people voting Democrat but the difference is they had to get the parent out of the home the father out of the home so what did that do that means kids were growing up without a parent without their father and then you incentivize single mothers to marry the government and then fathers weren't able to get jobs they were locked up and then insert Bill Clinton in the nineties with his crime bill act supported by Democrats not supported by Republicans see it's coincidence right right you're gonna say the party switch yet the Republicans have had their fingerprints all over everything having to do with freedom they've always been the party of freedom the Democratic Party has always been the party of slavery Jim Crow KKK all the segregation laws you know they voted against all of the civil rights legislation they filibustered stuff you know that filibuster rule was made famous by Democrats you know so Bill Clinton with his crime bill locked up more black men than any other president in United States history okay so the I mean the historical facts are there but if people want to deny the historical facts okay let's talk about modern-day Democratic Party modern-day slavery modern-day slave plantations okay so use the eye test go to any mostly black Democrat run city you know your Cleveland your Chicago Detroit Baltimore Philadelphia Memphis Oakland their [ __ ] cities I mean let's call it what it is I mean these cities have all the elements of a modern-day slave plantation you have your Democratic mayor your poverty pimp your Maxine Waters these are the gatekeepers these are the these are the plantation owners you know or plantation masters they're pretty much just running the show they come out get your vote every four years or every two years and they talk about what they're gonna give you while also smearing Republicans talking about Republicans want to take away your freedom I want to take away your your handouts your programs your housing your food Republicans all they want to do is suggest that you're smart enough to do it on your own you don't need the government but black people their minds have been and not just black people I mean Hispanics suit pretty much anyone that's below the poverty line living in one of these cities they felt like the Democrats are really for them so they follow that narrative they believe into it they're a sacred cow they're part of the group they're part of the identity group works like you're the victim vote for me I'll make sure you have food stamps we're gonna get you reparations people eat that up man people eat it up but the modern-day slave plantation has all the elements you have the slave master which is a congresswoman like Maxine Waters or mayor you have your Al Sharpton's you have your young poverty pimps then you have substandard housing you have your handouts which is pretty much just like master giving out the scraps giving out food masters taking good care of you then it's overrun with police you know locking people up there's a lot of crime you don't have fathers in the homes you have Planned Parenthood on every corner you have failing infrastructure in these cities and most of them had Democratic mayor's since like the 40s the 50s the 60s so you tell me if the party's really switch I can't tell because if you're looking at every one of these cities I just mentioned how can you say that the parties actually switched and Democrats are for the people you know and now they've found their new sacred count they've moved on from black people Democrats are so over black people their new sacred cow their new residual voting bloc that they're trying to finesse is the illegal immigrants and what are they selling they're selling come on over here they're using that big welfare magnet bringing people up from Central and South America knowing they're gonna go on welfare right away they're gonna have kids here they're gonna bring kids over they want instant amnesty for them because they know that that's gonna build a residual voting bloc for them that is all they want to do so I could never vote for Democrats ever again and don't ever talk to me about how the party switched if the party switched it would be so evident these cities that are run

You know how about this. We all know the Republican Party was founded in 1854 in opposition to slavery, right to keep it from expanding to the West, and you know the civil. The civil war happened as a result of it and they won, and the Republican Party ported the 13, 14 and 15 amendments for slaves. You know free in the slaves making them citizens allowing them to vote.

The sacred cows status has been given to you by the Democrats and become a sovereign free-thinking individual that you were born to be it's your divine purpose.

That is all they want to do so. I could never vote for Democrats ever again and don't ever talk to me about how the party switched if the party switched, it would be so evident.

The sacred cows status has been given to you by the Democrats and become a sovereign free-thinking individual that you were born to be it's your divine purpose to be a free-thinking, independent person. So, back to this whole Democrat Republican switch right, so you had Margaret Sanger with Planned Parenthood, which, by the way, Planned Parenthood's are mostly in minority communities. Go look across all of America they're, mostly in minority communities. Eugenics is a real thing. They're actually doing eugenics in Iceland right now, but eugenics in America was used to you know, exterminate the black race and with the Welfare Act that was passed by LBJ. You know that got black people voting Democrat, but the difference is they had to get the parent out of the home, the father out of the home. So what did that? Do? That means kids were growing up without a parent without their father, and then you incentivize single mothers to marry the government and then fathers weren't able to get jobs. They were locked up and then insert Bill Clinton in the nineties with his crime bill act supported by Democrats, not supported by Republicans, see it's coincidence right right, you're gonna say the party switch yet the Republicans have had their fingerprints all over everything having to do with freedom. They've always been the party of freedom. The Democratic Party has always been the party of slavery, Jim Crow KKK, all the segregation laws. You know they voted against all of the civil rights legislation they filibustered stuff. You know that filibuster rule was made famous by Democrats. You know so. Bill Clinton, with his crime bill locked up more black men than any other president in United, States history, okay, so the I mean the historical facts are there, but if people want to deny the historical facts, okay, let's talk about modern-day Democratic, Party, modern-day slavery, modern-day slave plantations, okay, so use the eye test go to any, mostly black, Democrat run city. You know your Cleveland, your Chicago Detroit Baltimore, Philadelphia, Memphis Oakland, their [ __, ] cities, I mean let's call it. What it is I mean these cities have all the elements of a modern-day slave plantation. You have your Democratic mayor, your poverty pimp your Maxine Waters. These are the gatekeepers. These are the these are the plantation owners. You know, or plantation masters, they're, pretty much just running the show they come out, get your vote every four years or every two years, and they talk about what they're gonna give you, while also smearing Republicans talking about Republicans, want to take away your freedom. I want to take away your your handouts, your programs, your housing, your food Republicans. All they want to do is suggest that you're smart enough to do it on your own. You don't need the government, but black people, their minds have been, and not just black people I mean Hispanics suit. Pretty much anyone that's below the poverty line living in one of these cities. They felt like the Democrats are really for them, so they follow that narrative. They believe into it. They're a sacred cow they're part of the group they're part of the identity group works like you're. The victim vote. For me. I'll make sure you have food stamps, we're gonna get you reparations. People eat that up man. People eat it up, but the modern-day slave plantation has all the elements you have the slave master, which is a congresswoman like Maxine, Waters or mayor. You have your Al Sharpton's. You have your young poverty pimps. Then you have substandard housing. You have your handouts, which is pretty much just like master, giving out the scraps giving out food masters, taking good care of you. Then it's overrun with police. You know, locking people up, there's a lot of crime. You don't have fathers in the homes. You have Planned Parenthood on every corner, you have failing infrastructure in these cities and most of them had Democratic mayor's since, like the 40s, the 50s, the 60s. So you tell me if the party's really switch I can't tell because, if you're looking at every one of these cities I just mentioned, how can you say that the parties actually switched and Democrats are for the people you know and now they've found their new sacred count? They've moved on from black people, Democrats are so over black people, their new sacred cow, their new residual voting bloc. That they're trying to finesse is the illegal immigrants and what are they? Selling they're selling come on over here they're, using that big welfare magnet, bringing people up from Central and South America, knowing they're gonna go on welfare right away. They're gonna have kids here, they're gonna bring kids over. They want instant amnesty for them because they know that that's gonna build a residual voting bloc for them. That is all they want to do so. I could never vote for Democrats ever again and don't ever talk to me about how the party switched. If the party switched, it would be so evident. These cities that are run by Democrats would be socialist utopias. They would just be utopias, there'd be trees, sprouting everywhere, you'd, be never a cloudy day in Cleveland, jobs would be booming, schools would be the best in the nation. No, instead it's some of the worst in the nation. What's up guys, you know what so I can't leave this walkaway campaign alone. I want to capitalize, while you know strike while the iron is hot. I didn't want to include this in my video yesterday, just because I didn't want it to be too long, but there is one other huge elephant in the room as far as reasons why I walked away from the Democratic, Party and I will never ever vote for the Democratic Party again, and that reason is the myth that the party switched at some point along history in America that the Democratic, Party and Republican Party magically did a big switch and the Democrats the bad guys suddenly became the good guys and the Republicans were the good guys and went from the good guys to be in the bad guys that southern strategy that Richard Nixon wanted to campaign in the south just to be competitive is a myth and the fact that I was taught that in school. Knowing that the facts are out there that the party's never switched. Is it just pisses me off? You know it's just a further validation that the public school system is failed. The fact that the government controls the indoctrination they control the curriculum. Therefore they control the narrative. You know it makes you wonder what our kids learning today that we're gonna see down the road is a lie: they're gonna, wake up and realize wow I was duped, they told me Donald Trump was a fascist, they told me Barack Obama was one of the greatest presidents in history. Kids could very well be learning that right now, I, don't have kids right now, but when I do you best believe I'll either be homeschooling them or sending them to private school or charter schools, something else they're not going to public school? Just because it's it's such a fallacy that you know you can teach someone whatever you want them to learn and the parents have no say-so in it. You know the curriculum is all messed up so anyway, I don't want to get off on the tangent. I want to talk about how the Democrat and Republican Party never switched and I don't need all of the dates and all the historical facts for it, because it's just so plain to see. You know how about this. We all know the Republican Party was founded in 1854 in opposition to slavery, right to keep it from expanding to the West, and you know the civil. The civil war happened as a result of it and they won, and the Republican Party ported the 13 14 and 15 amendments for slaves. You know free in the slaves making them citizens allowing them to vote. The Democratic Party was against it against all three of those amendments. Right then, you have the first black politician ever was Republican Martin Luther King was a Republican. You know the only reason that there was a switch was the black voter switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. So the only strategy that really happened was the welfare strategy. That's right, the LBJ, Act I believe it was 1964. The Great Society act where he realized. Okay, well, blacks are voting now. So that means that their vote makes a difference. We have to figure out a way to get them. I'm, probably butchering the quote, but he pretty much said you know. I'll have those in words vote Democrat for the next 200 years. We have to give him something, but not enough to make a difference so insert the Great Society welfare act and then ever since that Welfare Act single motherhood in the black community is up like 73 percent, since the 1960s also the Planned Parenthood. You know, Margaret Sanger was like a lady, Ku, Klux, Klan member and she talked about eugenics and how black people need to be controlled by weeds. These are all facts that you guys can look up. You know for anybody. That's gonna, come in the comments section talk about this walk away: movement. There's people bragging about going from Democrat to Republican. It's not even about that. It's about breaking away from the narratives. You know detaching yourself from your victimhood status. The sacred cows status has been given to you by the Democrats and become a sovereign free-thinking individual that you were born to be it's your divine purpose to be a free-thinking, independent person. So, back to this whole Democrat Republican switch right, so you had Margaret Sanger with Planned Parenthood, which, by the way, Planned Parenthood's are mostly in minority communities. Go look across all of America they're, mostly in minority communities. Eugenics is a real thing. They're actually doing eugenics in Iceland right now, but eugenics in America was used to you know, exterminate the black race and with the Welfare Act that was passed by LBJ. You know that got black people voting Democrat, but the difference is they had to get the parent out of the home, the father out of the home. So what did that? Do? That means kids were growing up without a parent without their father, and then you incentivize single mothers to marry the government and then fathers weren't able to get jobs. They were locked up and then insert Bill Clinton in the nineties with his crime bill act supported by Democrats, not supported by Republicans, see it's coincidence right right, you're gonna say the party switch yet the Republicans have had their fingerprints all over everything having to do with freedom. They've always been the party of freedom. The Democratic Party has always been the party of slavery, Jim Crow KKK, all the segregation laws. You know they voted against all of the civil rights legislation they filibustered stuff. You know that filibuster rule was made famous by Democrats. You know so. Bill Clinton, with his crime bill locked up more black men than any other president in United, States history, okay, so the I mean the historical facts are there, but if people want to deny the historical facts, okay, let's talk about modern-day Democratic, Party, modern-day slavery, modern-day slave plantations, okay, so use the eye test go to any, mostly black, Democrat run city. You know your Cleveland, your Chicago Detroit Baltimore, Philadelphia, Memphis Oakland, their [ __, ] cities, I mean let's call it. What it is I mean these cities have all the elements of a modern-day slave plantation. You have your Democratic mayor, your poverty pimp your Maxine Waters. These are the gatekeepers. These are the these are the plantation owners. You know, or plantation masters, they're, pretty much just running the show they come out, get your vote every four years or every two years, and they talk about what they're gonna give you, while also smearing Republicans talking about Republicans, want to take away your freedom. I want to take away your your handouts, your programs, your housing, your food Republicans. All they want to do is suggest that you're smart enough to do it on your own. You don't need the government, but black people, their minds have been, and not just black people I mean Hispanics suit. Pretty much anyone that's below the poverty line living in one of these cities. They felt like the Democrats are really for them, so they follow that narrative. They believe into it. They're a sacred cow they're part of the group they're part of the identity group works like you're. The victim vote. For me. I'll make sure you have food stamps, we're gonna get you reparations. People eat that up man. People eat it up, but the modern-day slave plantation has all the elements you have the slave master, which is a congresswoman like Maxine, Waters or mayor. You have your Al Sharpton's. You have your young poverty pimps. Then you have substandard housing. You have your handouts, which is pretty much just like master, giving out the scraps giving out food masters, taking good care of you. Then it's overrun with police. You know, locking people up, there's a lot of crime. You don't have fathers in the homes. You have Planned Parenthood on every corner, you have failing infrastructure in these cities and most of them had Democratic mayor's since, like the 40s, the 50s, the 60s. So you tell me if the party's really switch I can't tell because, if you're looking at every one of these cities I just mentioned, how can you say that the parties actually switched and Democrats are for the people you know and now they've found their new sacred count? They've moved on from black people, Democrats are so over black people, their new sacred cow, their new residual voting bloc. That they're trying to finesse is the illegal immigrants and what are they? Selling they're selling come on over here they're, using that big welfare magnet, bringing people up from Central and South America, knowing they're gonna go on welfare right away. They're gonna have kids here, they're gonna bring kids over. They want instant amnesty for them because they know that that's gonna build a residual voting bloc for them.

36,2PHXGl7qaBg,my name is Lisa and I am from central Pennsylvania out walk my dogs today I wanted to make a video because I saw that there was requests requests out there because I guess apparently people think were Russian BOTS or not yeah I'm happy to be part of the walk away movement a little bit about me I am grew up in a home where politics wasn't really important in fact I don't even know if my parents ever voted so it wasn't really something I grew up with and then I joined the Navy when I was 18 and served my country for four years and I didn't even vote when I was in the military kind of strange when I think about it now um when I was 22 I had two kids or I had one kid actually and then 24 I had another one that's when it kind of became important to me that you know I take responsibility and start thinking about my country where it was headed and what kind of country I wanted my kids to be a part of so I started who actually I joined the Democratic Party you think all twenty something year olds joined the Democratic Party because we feel like that is the People's Party and voted and pretty much Democratic all the way through I think at one point I may have voted for Bush I can't remember it just wasn't that important to me and then of course after Barack Obama got put in office which I did vote for him the first term I just saw how America became stagnant and and then disrespected and then it's just like everything he said he did he never did I thought he would be the people's president and I was so excited to have a black president I thought wow man we're really progressive here in America I just felt like he was a puppet you know he just really didn't do much of anything I mean I will give him credit you know we did catch Saddam Hussein and cut Osama bin Laden I mean I think those are good things but as far as what he did to make America a better country I can't really speak much that matter of fact I'm so disillusioned I decided not to even vote in the last election for Obama this election of course I switched the Republican Party even before the primaries I want to ben Carson to get the nomination but when he didn't I have to say it first I was a little shocked that it was Donald Trump I kind of thought he'd be a good economic president but I have to say I'm blown away at what he's done for America it's just been amazing he's done more in a year and a half then I think any president that I can remember in history so um yeah so once I decided that he was the guy and I voted for him and now that I've seen all the change yeah I just think it's great and I think he is making America great again but let's face it he can't do it without us he needs supporters not only does he need supporters but other Republicans or independents people that are willing to work with Donald Trump need to be put in office I want to see what this guy can do with some real people standing behind him and willing to fight for America and put America first so you know I'm not even about just a voting Republican I'm about voting for whoever has America's interests at best yeah America's interest at their heart you know that should be the first and foremost thing in their agenda the other reason I'm making this video is because I want to speak to something that really has bothered me a lot over these probably last 18 months which is you know there's a lot of misinformation out there about Republicans not all Republicans are rich I'm certainly not rich I am a Christian but I will say you know there's again misinformation out there not all Republicans are racist not more homophobic or you know all those terrible words they used to describe people you know growing up I had a lot of friends of color some of my best friends were black people boys and girls actually and no one else in the Navy I had my best friend who's really like a sister to me she was bisexual and again I'm a Christian but you know what it's not my place to judge her lifestyle or Jam whatever things I may think are right or wrong it's not my place to me we all bleed red and when you take the skin off of our bodies we're all the same on the end say well have a heart we'll have a brain we'll have lung we're all the same black white red yellow gay straight whatever we're all the same raw God's children and he loves every one of us you,"My name is Lisa and I am from central Pennsylvania out walk my dogs today, I wanted to make a video, because I saw that there was requests requests out there, because I guess apparently people think were Russian BOTS or not yeah I'm happy to be part of the walk away movement. A little bit about me. I am grew up in a home where politics wasn't really important. In fact, I don't even know if my parents ever voted, so it wasn't really something I grew up with and then I joined the Navy when I was 18 and served my country for four years and I didn't even vote when I was in the military kind of strange when I think about it. Now um when I was 22, I had two kids or I had one kid actually and then 24 I had another one. That's when it kind of became important to me that you know I, take responsibility and start thinking about my country where it was headed and what kind of country I wanted my kids to be a part of so I started who actually I joined the Democratic Party. You think all twenty something year olds joined the Democratic Party because we feel like that is the People's Party and voted and pretty much Democratic all the way through I. Think at one point, I may have voted for Bush. I can't remember it. Just wasn't that important to me and then, of course, after Barack Obama got put in office which I did vote for him. The first term I just saw how America became stagnant and and then disrespected, and then it's just like everything he said he did. He never did I thought he would be the people's president and I was so excited to have a black president. I thought wow man we're really progressive here in America I just felt like he was a puppet. You know he just really didn't do much of anything I mean I will give him credit. You know we did catch, Saddam, Hussein and cut Osama bin Laden I mean I, think those are good things, but as far as what he did to make America a better country, I can't really speak much. That matter of fact, I'm, so disillusioned, I decided not to even vote in the last election for Obama this election. Of course, I switched the Republican Party even before the primaries. I want to ben Carson to get the nomination, but when he didn't I have to say it first I was a little shocked that it was Donald, Trump, I kind of thought, he'd be a good economic president, but I have to say I'm blown away at what he's done for America. It's just been amazing, he's done more in a year and a half, then I think any president that I can remember in history, so um yeah, so once I decided that he was the guy and I voted for him, and now that I've seen all the change, yeah I just think it's great and I think he is making America great again. But let's face it, he can't do it without us. He needs supporters. Not only does he need supporters, but other Republicans or independents, people that are willing to work with Donald Trump need to be put in office. I want to see what this guy can do with some real people, standing behind him and willing to fight for America and put America first. So you know I'm not even about just a voting Republican I'm about voting for whoever has America's interests at best yeah America's interest at their heart. You know that should be the first and foremost thing in their agenda. The other reason I'm making this video is because I want to speak to something that really has bothered me a lot over these probably last 18 months, which is you know, there's a lot of misinformation out there about Republicans. Not all Republicans are rich I'm. Certainly not rich I am a Christian, but I will say you know, there's again misinformation out there. Not all Republicans are racist, not more homophobic or you know all those terrible words they used to describe people. You know growing up. I had a lot of friends of color. Some of my best friends were black people, boys and girls. Actually, and no one else in the Navy I had my best friend who's. Really, like a sister to me, she was bisexual and again I'm a Christian, but you know what it's not my place to judge her lifestyle or Jam, whatever things I may think, are right or wrong. It's not my place to me. We all bleed red and when you take the skin off of our bodies, we're all the same on the end say: well, have a heart we'll have a brain, we'll have lung we're all the same black white, red, yellow gay straight whatever we're all the same raw God's children and he loves every one of us. You."
37,2vbO2Tlzn8I,hello everyone so today I'm gonna share with you my walkaway story I've been watching some of your some of your Walker weight stories and inspired me to share mine so here it is so I grew up in Northern California very liberal part of the country I was raised by a very liberal minded family on my mother's side I went through the California public school system my whole life which as you can imagine this in the most pro-america minded organization in the country and as a 20 21 22 year old I was trying to get my feet underneath me and support myself but I just couldn't find a job couldn't find a job my mom at the time couldn't find a job she was very qualified she was very qualified she had a lot of experience in a very prominent well-thought-out popular field and in that state but couldn't find a job at the time though work force participation rate was the hot was the lowest that it had been in 40 years at this time the unemployment rate where I was living at in in Sacramento California was was very high and all that I heard from anyone was that it's all the Conservatives false and one day the penny just dropped for me and I you know realized you know there aren't any there aren't any conservatives here where this place is run by Liberal Democrats these problems are caused by Liberal Democrats um on my analysis of liberal ideology of the Democratic Party's ideology I agree with them on the on the ends of things but I don't always agree with them on the means to those ends I think that the means that they're implementing cause greater problems and actually lead them farther away than what they're actually trying to accomplish you know they want everyone to have health insurance they want everyone to be healthy they want everybody to have a doctor I like that idea I think that's a good idea but I don't agree with the means of giving more money to the government to pay for things well equate to the problem we that's just more of the same thing that we have been doing we were you know spending trillions of dollars on this problem isn't going to make the problem go away when we tried spending billions on it and millions on it the problem isn't a lack of government spending it's a lack of we're forming the system okay you know the democratic parties say that there for women's rights there for protecting women I think that's a great idea but they only but they minimize women's rights to abortions and and getting free birth control right women have freedom of speech Democratic Party doesn't defend that women have a right to protect themselves how they have a right to own a gun Democratic Party is trying to suppress that women have private property rights women owned businesses women have money women rely on businesses to survive and the Democratic parties just just tried to suppress and to stop that it's they're in the business of taking wealth from people taking wealth from women manipulating markets to benefit markets in the economy to benefit the ruling elite over everybody else over these women who own businesses over you know or if they don't own businesses isn't businesses that women rely on to survive right they're all about suppressing that right the Democratic Party says that therefore fighting for the african-american community and providing them justice and social justice I think that's a good idea but then again they're the African American community has freedom of speech with the deaf which the Democratic Party is trying to censor and and stop the African American community has you know owns weapons we have the Democratic Party is trying to take guns away from them the African American community has has money but the Democratic Party is just always trying to take more money from them through taxation or the african-american community owns businesses or they or they rely on businesses to survive but yeah the Democratic Party is all about manipulating the markets to benefit you know the ruling elite over everybody else the Democratic Party says that therefore you know the common individual and against the big bad evil corporations and I think that can be a good idea but then they go ahead and they support systems like the Federal Reserve banking system which gives monopoly power on creating the world's reserve currency to a group of small elitist bankers whose identities we don't know right today's therefore systems like the export-import bank which is a system created by the federal government which does nothing other than give huge loans to major corporations with money from the common individual right there for other crony capitalist legislation like increasing you know like investing the people's money and businesses which is very crony capitalist I don't support so at that time I decided to walk away from the left and I consider myself conservative however I don't think that the battle in politics is left versus right or red vs. blue Republican versus Democrat I think the a better description of the battle and politics is really top down it's really vertical it's really the people at the top of the system people who work for the government people who run businesses who are manipulating government to benefit them they're centralizing more power to them versus the people the common individual person who doesn't have connection to that to that system to that network that's where the battle is and the debate is I think the you know I think the a good description of the problem isn't left or liberal but it's statist statist is involved in both political parties you know the status say that the solution say that the reason why you don't have a good life the reason why things are hard for you is because the people at the top of the system don't have enough money and power to make everything fair and equal and balanced forever buddy and only and if only you would just give them more of your money and let them control more aspects of your life well everything for you and everybody at the bottom of the pyramid become better which isn't true by the more that we centralize more money to the state or power to the state the worse that things get for people at the bottom and I think what we need to be doing is we need to be reforming the systems reforming the government reforming the way reforming the relationship between government and business so that it works better for people it's more so it works better for people and it's more an appropriate relationship and between government business and allow the people to keep the money that they need a lot of the people to live the life that they want to live and so you can have a wealthy populace and you can still have government it's not it's not government it's not a decision between government or or a healthy economy you can have both you can have a thriving economy and you can have a government ruin its basic idea of being an institution designed to protect people so that's the that's the mindset that we need to have to resolve this political problem hello everyone so today I'm gonna share with you my walkaway story I've been watching some of your some of your Walker weight stories and inspired me to share mine so here it is so I grew up in Northern California very liberal part of the country I was raised by a very liberal minded family on my mother's side I went through the California public school system my whole life which as you can imagine this in the most pro-america minded organization in the country and as a 20 21 22 year old I was trying to get my feet underneath me and support myself but I just couldn't find a job couldn't find a job my mom at the time couldn't find a job she was very qualified she was very qualified she had a lot of experience in a very prominent well-thought-out popular field and in that state but couldn't find a job at the time though work force participation rate was the hot was the lowest that it had been in 40 years at this time the unemployment rate where I was living at in in Sacramento California was was very high and all that I heard from anyone was that it's all the Conservatives false and one day the penny just dropped for me and I you know realized you know there aren't any there aren't any conservatives here where this place is run by Liberal Democrats these problems are caused by Liberal Democrats um on my analysis of liberal ideology of the Democratic Party's ideology I agree with them on the on the ends of things but I don't always agree with them on the means to those ends I think that the means that they're implementing cause greater problems and actually lead them farther away than what they're actually trying to accomplish you know they want everyone to have health insurance they want everyone to be healthy they want everybody to have a doctor I like that idea I think that's a good idea but I don't agree with the means of giving more money to the government to pay for things well equate to the problem we that's just more of the same thing that we have been doing we were you know spending trillions of dollars on this problem isn't going to make the problem go away when we tried spending billions on it and millions on it the problem isn't a lack of government spending it's a lack of we're forming the system okay you know the democratic parties say that there for women's rights there for protecting women I think that's a great idea but they only but they minimize women's rights to abortions and and getting free birth control right women have freedom of speech Democratic Party doesn't defend that women have a right to protect themselves how they have a right to own a gun Democratic Party is trying to suppress that women have private property rights women owned businesses women have money women rely on businesses to survive and the Democratic parties just just tried to suppress and to stop that it's they're in the business of taking wealth from people taking wealth from women manipulating markets to benefit markets in the economy to benefit the ruling elite over everybody else over these women who own businesses over you know or if they don't own businesses isn't businesses that women rely on to survive right they're all about suppressing that right the Democratic Party says that therefore fighting for the african-american community and providing them justice and social justice I think that's a good idea but then again they're the African American community has freedom of speech with the deaf which the Democratic Party is trying to censor and and stop the African American community has you know owns weapons we have the Democratic Party is trying to take guns away from them the African American community has has money but the Democratic Party is just always trying to take more money from them through taxation or the african-american community owns businesses or they or they rely on businesses to survive but yeah the Democratic Party is all about manipulating the markets to benefit you know the ruling elite over everybody else the Democratic Party says that therefore you know the common individual and against the big bad evil corporations and I think that can be a good idea but then they go ahead and they support systems like the Federal Reserve banking system which gives monopoly power on creating the world's reserve currency to a group of small elitist bankers whose identities we don't know right today's therefore systems like the export-import bank which is a system created by the federal government which does nothing other than give huge loans to major corporations with money from the common individual right there for other crony capitalist legislation like increasing you know like investing the people's money and businesses which is very crony capitalist I don't support so at that time I decided to walk away from the left and I consider myself conservative however I don't think that the battle in politics is left versus right or red vs. blue Republican versus Democrat I think the a better description of the battle and politics is really top down it's really vertical it's really the people at the top of the system people who work for the government people who run businesses who are manipulating government to benefit them they're centralizing more power to them versus the people the common individual person who doesn't have connection to that to that system to that network that's where the battle is and the debate is I think the you know I think the a good description of the problem isn't left or liberal but it's statist statist is involved in both political parties you know the status say that the solution say that the reason why you don't have a good life the reason why things are hard for you is because the people at the top of the system don't have enough money and power to make everything fair and equal and balanced forever buddy and only and if only you would just give them more of your money and let them control more aspects of your life well everything for you and everybody at the bottom of the pyramid become better which isn't true by the more that we centralize more money to the state or power to the state the worse that things get for people at the bottom and I think what we need to be doing is we need to be reforming the systems reforming the government reforming the way reforming the relationship between government and business so that it works better for people it's more so it works better for people and it's more an appropriate relationship and between government business and allow the people to keep the money that they need a lot of the people to live the life that they want to live and so you can have a wealthy populace and you can still have government it's not it's not government it's not a decision between government or or a healthy economy you can have both you can have a thriving economy and you can have a government ruin its basic idea of being an institution designed to protect people so that's the that's the mindset that we need to have to resolve this political problem,"Hello everyone so today, I'm gonna share with you. My walkaway story I've been watching some of your some of your Walker weight stories and inspired me to share mine. So here it is so I grew up in Northern, California, very liberal part of the country I was raised by a very liberal minded family. On my mother's side, I went through the California public school system. My whole life, which, as you can imagine this in the most pro-america minded organization in the country and as a 20 21 22 year old I, was trying to get my feet underneath me and support myself, but I just couldn't find a job couldn't find a job. My mom at the time couldn't find a job. She was very qualified. She was very qualified. She had a lot of experience in a very prominent, well-thought-out popular field and in that state, but couldn't find a job at the time, though work force participation rate was the hot was the lowest that it had been in 40 years. At this time, the unemployment rate where I was living at in in Sacramento California was was very high, and all that I heard from anyone was that it's all the Conservatives false and one day the penny just dropped for me and I, you know realized. You know there aren't any. There aren't any conservatives here where this place is run by Liberal Democrats. These problems are caused by Liberal Democrats um, on my analysis of liberal ideology of the Democratic Party's ideology, I agree with them on the on the ends of things, but I, don't always agree with them on the means to those ends. I think that the means that they're implementing cause greater problems and actually lead them farther away than what they're actually trying to accomplish you know they want everyone to have health insurance. They want everyone to be healthy. They want everybody to have a doctor. I like that idea. I think that's a good idea, but I don't agree with the means of giving more money to the government to pay for things well equate to the problem. We that's just more of the same thing that we have been doing. We were you know, spending trillions of dollars on this problem isn't going to make the problem go away when we tried spending billions on it and millions on it. The problem isn't a lack of government spending. It's a lack of we're forming the system. Okay, you know the democratic parties say that there for women's rights there for protecting women I think that's a great idea, but they only, but they minimize women's rights to abortions and and getting free birth control right. Women have freedom of speech. Democratic Party doesn't defend that women have a right to protect themselves, how they have a right to own a gun. Democratic Party is trying to suppress that women have private property rights, women owned businesses, women have money, women rely on businesses to survive and the Democratic parties just just tried to suppress and to stop that. It's they're in the business of taking wealth from people taking wealth from women, manipulating markets to benefit markets in the economy to benefit the ruling elite over everybody else over these women who own businesses over you know or if they don't own businesses, isn't businesses that women rely on to survive right. They're. All about suppressing that right. The Democratic Party says that therefore fighting for the african-american community and providing them justice and social justice I think that's a good idea, but then again they're the African American community has freedom of speech with the deaf which the Democratic Party is trying to censor and and stop the African American community has, you know, owns weapons we have the Democratic. Party is trying to take guns away from them. The African American community has has money, but the Democratic Party is just always trying to take more money from them through taxation or the african-american community owns businesses or they or they rely on businesses to survive, but yeah. The Democratic Party is all about manipulating the markets to benefit. You know the ruling elite over everybody else. The Democratic Party says that. Therefore, you know the common individual and against the big, bad evil corporations and I think that can be a good idea, but then they go ahead and they support systems like the Federal Reserve banking system, which gives monopoly power on creating the world's reserve currency to a group of small, elitist bankers whose identities we don't know right. Today's therefore systems, like the export-import bank, which is a system created by the federal government, which does nothing other than give huge loans to major corporations with money from the common individual right there for other crony capitalist legislation like increasing you know like investing the people's money and businesses, which is very crony, capitalist I, don't support so at that time, I decided to walk away from the left and I. Consider myself conservative, however, I, don't think that the battle in politics is left versus, right or red vs. blue Republican versus Democrat I. Think the a better description of the battle and politics is really top down. It's really vertical: it's really the people at the top of the system, people who work for the government, people who run businesses who are manipulating government to benefit them, they're, centralizing, more power to them versus the people, the common individual person who doesn't have connection to that to that system to that network, that's where the battle is, and the debate is I think the you know, I think the a good description of the problem isn't left or liberal, but it's statist statist is involved in both political parties. You know the status say that the solution say that the reason why you don't have a good life. The reason why things are hard for you is because the people at the top of the system don't have enough money and power to make everything fair and equal and balanced, forever buddy, and only- and if only you would just give them more of your money and let them control more aspects of your life. Well, everything for you and everybody at the bottom of the pyramid become better, which isn't true by the more that we centralize more money to the state or power to the state, the worse that things get for people at the bottom and I think what we need to be doing is. We need to be reforming the systems reforming the government, reforming the way, reforming the relationship between government and business so that it works better for people it's more. So it works better for people and it's more an appropriate relationship and between government business and allow the people to keep the money that they need. A lot of the people to live the life that they want to live, and so you can have a wealthy populace and you can still have government. It's not it's not government, it's not a decision between government or or a healthy economy. You can have both. You can have a thriving economy and you can have a government ruin its basic idea of being an institution designed to protect people. So that's the that's the mindset that we need to have to resolve this political problem, hello, everyone! So today, I'm gonna share with you my walkaway story. I've been watching some of your some of your Walker weight stories and inspired me to share mine.

38,2x2zsUZ6gd0,"taking me quite a while to get up my courage to make this video I joined the walkway movement when I was practically approximately say 3,800 people and the reason I joined the walkway movement was because I walked away I was a lifelong Democrat and towards the end of not even towards the end I'd say I voted for President Obama twice but somewhere in his second term I started feeling disillusioned I didn't like what I was seeing going on in our country there's a lot of things I live five minutes from Baltimore and I could see what was happening there but what really gave me my walk away was a disillusioned moment and what happened was I was exploring the the candidates because I knew I wasn't gonna vote for Hillary Clinton because I had watched Hillary's America and some other things and I was completely not absolutely not just like I never voted for Barack Obama because it was black I wasn't gonna vote for Hillary Clinton because she was a woman I don't like that that is never a determining factor I don't make choices based on sex or race or sexual orientation or anything like that that's not how I make my decisions so anyway I was watching I decided I was gonna watch a trump rally because I heard so much prop about him and so much negativity and whatnot and just on Facebook because like I said I don't really watch TV and I definitely don't watch mainstream media and never I haven't for a while but anyway so I said I'm gonna watch this Trump rally I'm gonna see what's going on he almost who everybody you know what's going on so imagine my surprise when the rally was canceled due to threats of violence I couldn't believe it I was like wait a minute this is the United States of America and you know if you don't want to hear somebody speak you just don't go if you don't want to partake of information that you don't feel be beneficial to you you just don't listen or if you really want to be informed you listen and you take it in and then you decide what you want to do with that information at least that's you know what I do and that's what I believe so when I saw that I said why is going on why would threats of violence and I got on my laptop and I started looking on YouTube and pulling up all these videos that weren't on the news even though I turned on the mainstream media and I can't remember what station was I couldn't even tell you who the people were that we're talking but um the next thing I knew what I was seeing on the screen and what they were talking about were two totally different things I was seeing innocent people husbands wives children you name it being verbally attacked physically assaulted things thrown at them um and I'm like who is doing this it was you know what's killing of what why are these people being attacked it's how I got on my computer like I said in it I couldn't believe what I saw these were Democrats I was a Democrat I freaked out I was like I was terrified for these people I said I was like how in the greatest country on Earth in the United States of America are people not allowed to go to a rally they hear someone speak and then as my journey that night because I stayed up late that night I started seeing all these other things where things going on college campuses and and violence and radicalism and all these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democrats well immediately I I just couldn't believe it I I said I can't believe this is the Democratic Party that I belong to and then I said well let me see I knew the Democratic Party or at least you know those in power and Democrat right they're denouncing this they have to be no now they were not denouncing it I was you've got to be kidding me nobody in the in it you know as a DNC or any of these Democratic senators or program nobody is saying anything the President of the United States is not saying anything about people American citizens being attacked physically attacked for their political views or who knows what political affiliation these people were they were going to a rally to hear someone speak we don't know if there were Republicans or independents or libertarians or demography we don't know you know you can't tell just by looking at somebody what their political affiliation is so mm-hmm I was upset and the next day I went on the internet and I removed myself from the Democratic Party I said they're not gonna stand up to this and they're not gonna say hey you know these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democratic Party but we do not condone people go into a trump rally being their cars being vandalized and being assaulted and whatnot and you know whoo if you're not going up well they say you you you you know you stand for nothing you fall for anything well to me I felt like the Democratic Party was by not condemning this violence and these assaults they were condoning it and I don't care if you hate Donald Trump I don't care if you don't like him you think he's you know um he's not polished and offer he's he's too brash or whatever I don't care that doesn't give you the right to assault people so not really knowing the political climate as well as I should have I feel like you know I feel like I was always that proverbial ostrich with their head and his sand because of course like I said at first I didn't want to leave it was Democratic Party doing this and in second I couldn't believe that wasn't being condemned and then I said I can't be a part of this and the next day I went online and I removed myself from the Democratic Party I said until they get their act together I'm out I do not believe in violence I don't believe in attacking people but then I started seeing all people's Facebook pages cuz my brother I have a brother who is a staunch Republican I mean he is he is a patriot 100% he is all American but anyway I started seeing all these people attacking other people on Facebook and like viciously attacking people on there just for their opinions even if somebody said something as simple as you know I think I'm gonna you know consider mr. Trump I'm gonna go to you know read his platform what are you guys I mean family against family brothers and sisters against the parents against children children against parents and then I sort of find out about all this stuff on these college campuses that these kids in college were being basically brainwashed by these so-called educators and then fast forward to now we have actual politicians who were supposed to work for everyone in the country standing up with a microphone telling people to harass other people no you can't eat here no you can't get guests here no you can't shop here you need to go somewhere else because you're a trump supporter or your your you know you're not a Democrat so in other words you only represent a half of the country you don't represent the whole country no you're in the wrong job you need to retire and go mix knit yourself some scarves or something or find a hobby because honey a public servant serves the public not just the ones that they want to support this is ridiculous I cannot believe I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that I was terrified to make this video because I was afraid as an author and a writer an independent writer author that I'm going to get trashed on Amazon Goodreads because people don't like my politics you don't know my politics yes I walked away from the Democratic Party because of violence because of anger because I hate because a group think because of identity politics let me tell you something to all my brothers and sisters out there in the world and in America especially there are no minorities not in this group we don't have minorities in the street we have Americans if you see yourself as a minority as a victim or anything like that that means let me let me come here let me give you a hug because you're an American and just because of your sexual orientation the color of your skin your your race whatever that doesn't make you any different from me we just look different we just live different we're all Americans this has to stop we can't keep separating ourselves from each other this way we have to love one another support one another we have to be together and just I had to walk away because free speech is is one of the most important things in this country it's what makes this country great if you want to go out and protest for something that you believe in that's something that you believe you know that we all need to pay attention to please do we carry signs that say you know peace and love and you know we need to look we need to reach out to people whatever you know but when you gonna stand up there and attack people and saw people and threatened people and call people all names and accuse them of all these horrible things that are just completely untrue then you there's something wrong with you there's something broken inside of you but you know what you can fix it you can fix it take a step back tongue you know unplug try try listening know maybe you may never you know think that you know your beliefs you may never change your beliefs and you have every right to have every belief that you want however when your beliefs infringe on my rights and my family's rights and my friends rights and my fellow Americans rights that's where we're gonna have a problem because more and more people are gonna be walking away because they don't want to get beat up they don't want to get threatened they don't want to be called names they don't want to be treated like second-class citizens they don't want their public servants only serving half the country the only thing that is going to save this country is love and an acceptance and understanding that we're all different but we're all the same you taking me quite a while to get up my courage to make this video I joined the walkway movement when I was practically approximately say 3,800 people and the reason I joined the walkway movement was because I walked away I was a

Republican I mean he is he is a patriot 100% he is all American but anyway I started seeing all these people attacking other people on Facebook and like viciously attacking people on there just for their opinions even if somebody said something as simple as you know I think I'm gonna you know consider mr. Trump I'm gonna go to you know read his platform what are you guys I mean family against family brothers and sisters against the parents against children children against parents and then I sort of find out about all this stuff on these college campuses that these kids in college were being basically brainwashed by these so-called educators and then fast forward to now we have actual politicians who were supposed to work for everyone in the country standing up with a microphone telling people to harass other people no you can't eat here no you can't get guests here no you can't shop here you need to go somewhere else because you're a trump supporter or your your you know you're not a Democrat so in other words you only represent a half of the country you don't represent the whole country no you're in the wrong job you need to retire and go mix knit yourself some scarves or something or find a hobby because honey a public servant serves the public not just the ones that they want to support this is ridiculous I cannot believe I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that I was terrified to make this video because I was afraid as an author and a writer an independent writer author that I'm going to get trashed on Amazon Goodreads because people don't like my politics you don't know my politics yes I walked away from the Democratic Party because of violence because of anger because I hate because a group think because of identity politics let me tell you something to all my brothers and sisters out there in the world and in America especially there are no minorities not in this group we don't have minorities in the street we have Americans if you see yourself as a minority as a victim or anything like that that means let me let me come here let me give you a hug because you're an American and just because of your sexual orientation the color of your skin your your race whatever that doesn't make you any different from me we just look different we just live different we're all Americans this has to stop we can't keep separating ourselves from each other this way we have to love one another support one another we have to be together and just I had to walk away because free speech is is one of the most important things in this country it's what makes this country great if you want to go out and protest for something that you believe in that's something that you believe you know that we all need to pay attention to please do we carry signs that say you know peace and love and you know we need to look we need to reach out to people whatever you know but when you gonna stand up there and attack people and saw people and threatened people and call people all names and accuse them of all these horrible things that are just completely untrue then you there's something wrong with you there's something broken inside of you but you know what you can fix it you can fix it take a step back tongue you know unplug try try listening know maybe you may never you know think that you know your beliefs you may never change your beliefs and you have every right to have every belief that you want however when your beliefs infringe on my rights and my family's rights and my friends rights and my fellow Americans rights that's where we're gonna have a problem because more and more people are gonna be walking away because they don't want to get beat up they don't want to get threatened they don't want to be called names they don't want to be treated like second-class citizens they don't want their public servants only serving half the country the only thing that is going to save this country is love and an acceptance and understanding that we're all different but we're all the same you taking me quite a while to get up my courage to make this video I joined the walkway movement when I was practically approximately say 3,800 people and the reason I joined the walkway movement was because I walked away I was a lifelong Democrat and towards the end of not even towards the end I'd say I voted for President Obama twice but somewhere in his second term I started feeling disillusioned I didn't like what I was seeing going on in our country there's a lot of things I live five minutes from Baltimore and I could see what was happening there but what really gave me my walk away was a disillusioned moment and what happened was I was exploring the the candidates because I knew I wasn't gonna vote for Hillary Clinton because I had watched Hillary's America and some other things and I was completely not absolutely not just like I never voted for Barack Obama because it was black I wasn't gonna vote for Hillary Clinton because she was a woman I don't like that that is never a determining factor I don't make choices based on sex or race or sexual orientation or anything like that that's not how I make my decisions so anyway I was watching I decided I was gonna watch a trump rally because I heard so much prop about him and so much negativity and whatnot and just on Facebook because like I said I don't really watch TV and I definitely don't watch mainstream media and never I haven't for a while but anyway so I said I'm gonna watch this Trump rally I'm gonna see what's going on he almost who everybody you know what's going on so imagine my surprise when the rally was canceled due to threats of violence I couldn't believe it I was like wait a minute this is the United States of America and you know if you don't want to hear somebody speak you just don't go if you don't want to partake of information that you don't feel be beneficial to you you just don't listen or if you really want to be informed you listen and you take it in and then you decide what you want to do with that information at least that's you know what I do and that's what I believe so when I saw that I said why is going on why would threats of violence and I got on my laptop and I started looking on YouTube and pulling up all these videos that weren't on the news even though I turned on the mainstream media and I can't remember what station was I couldn't even tell you who the people were that we're talking but um the next thing I knew what I was seeing on the screen and what they were talking about were two totally different things I was seeing innocent people husbands wives children you name it being verbally attacked physically assaulted things thrown at them um and I'm like who is doing this it was you know what's killing of what why are these people being attacked it's how I got on my computer like I said in it I couldn't believe what I saw these were Democrats I was a Democrat I freaked out I was like I was terrified for these people I said I was like how in the greatest country on Earth in the United States of America are people not allowed to go to a rally they hear someone speak and then as my journey that night because I stayed up late that night I started seeing all these other things where things going on college campuses and and violence and radicalism and all these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democrats well immediately I I just couldn't believe it I I said I can't believe this is the Democratic Party that I belong to and then I said well let me see I knew the Democratic Party or at least you know those in power and Democrat right they're denouncing this they have to be no now they were not denouncing it I was you've got to be kidding me nobody in the in it you know as a DNC or any of these Democratic senators or program

political affiliation these people were they were going to a rally to hear someone speak we don't know if there were Republicans or independents or libertarians or demography we don't know you know you can't tell just by looking at somebody what their political affiliation is so mm-hmm I was upset and the next day I went on the internet and I removed myself from the Democratic Party I said they're not gonna stand up to this and they're not gonna say hey you know these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democratic Party but we do not condone people go into a trump rally being their cars being vandalized and being assaulted and whatnot and you know whoo if you're not going up well they say you you you you know you stand for nothing you fall for anything well to me I felt like the Democratic Party was by not condemning this violence and these assaults they were condoning it and I don't care if you hate Donald Trump I don't care if you don't like him you think he's

As an author and a writer, an independent writer author that I'm going to get trashed on Amazon Goodreads, because people don't like my politics, you don't know my politics.

We need to reach out to people whatever you know, but when you gonna stand up there and attack people and saw people and threatened people and call people all names and accuse them of all these horrible things that are just completely untrue, then you there's something wrong with you. There's something broken inside of you, but you know what you can fix it. You can fix it, take a step back tongue. You know, unplug, try, try listening know, maybe you may never.

Definitely don't watch mainstream media and never I haven't for a while, but anyway so I said I'm gonna watch this Trump rally, I'm gonna see what's going on, he almost who everybody you know what's going on, so imagine my surprise when the rally was canceled due to threats of violence, I couldn't believe it. I was like wait a minute. This is the United States of America, and you know. If you don't want to hear somebody speak, you just don't go. If you don't want to partake of information that you don't feel be beneficial to you, you just don't listen or if you really want to be informed, you listen and you take it in and then you decide what you want to do with that information. At least that's you know what I do and that's what I believe. So when I saw that I said, why is going on? Why would threats of violence and I got on my laptop and I started looking on YouTube and pulling up all these videos that weren't on the news, even though I turned on the mainstream media and I can't remember what station was I, couldn't even tell you who the people were that we're talking but um? The next thing I knew what I was seeing on the screen and what they were talking about were two totally different things. I was seeing innocent people, husbands, wives, children, you name it being verbally attacked physically assaulted things thrown at them, um and I'm like who is doing this. It was, you know, what's killing of what? Why are these people being attacked? It's how I got on my computer, like I, said in it I couldn't believe what I saw these were Democrats I was a Democrat I freaked out I was like I was terrified for these people. I said I was like how, in the greatest country on Earth in the United States of America, are people not allowed to go to a rally? They hear someone speak and then, as my journey that night, because I stayed up late, that night I started seeing all these other things where things going on college campuses and and violence and radicalism, and all these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democrats. Well immediately. I I just couldn't believe it I I said I can't believe this is the Democratic Party that I belong to and then I said well, let me see, I knew the Democratic Party, or at least you know those in power and Democrat right, they're denouncing this they have to be. No now they were not denouncing it. I was you've, got to be kidding me nobody in the in it. You know as a DNC or any of these Democratic senators or program. Nobody is saying anything. The President of the United States is not saying anything about people, American citizens being attacked physically attacked for their political views or who knows what political affiliation these people were. They were going to a rally to hear someone speak. We don't know if there were Republicans or independents or libertarians or demography. We don't know. You know you can't tell just by looking at somebody what their political affiliation is. So mm-hmm I was upset and the next day I went on the internet and I removed myself from the Democratic Party I said: they're, not gonna, stand up to this and they're not gonna, say hey. You know these people were doing this under the umbrella of the Democratic Party, but we do not condone people go into a trump rally, being their cars being vandalized and being assaulted and whatnot, and you know whoo if you're not going up well, they say you you you, you know you stand for nothing. You fall for anything well to me. I felt like the Democratic Party was by not condemning this violence and these assaults they were, condoning it and I, don't care if you hate Donald, Trump I, don't care. If you don't like him, you think he's you know, um he's not polished and offer he's he's too brash or whatever I. Don't care that doesn't give you the right to assault people, so not really knowing the political climate as well as I should have I feel, like you know, I feel like I was always that proverbial ostrich with their head and his sand, because, of course, like I said at first I didn't want to leave. It was Democratic Party doing this and in second I couldn't believe that wasn't being condemned and then I said. I can't be a part of this, and the next day I went online and I removed myself from the Democratic Party I said until they get their act together. I'm out I do not believe in violence, I, don't believe in attacking people, but then I started seeing all people's Facebook pages cuz. My brother I have a brother who is a staunch Republican I mean he is. He is a patriot 100%. He is all American, but anyway, I started seeing all these people attacking other people on Facebook and like viciously attacking people on there just for their opinions. Even if somebody said something as simple as you know, I think I'm gonna, you know consider mr. Trump I'm gonna go to. You know, read his platform. What are you guys? I mean family against family brothers and sisters against the parents against children, children against parents and then I sort of find out about all this stuff on these college campuses that these kids in college were being basically brainwashed by these so-called educators and then fast forward. To now we have actual politicians who were supposed to work for everyone in the country standing up with a microphone telling people to harass other people. No, you can't eat here. No, you can't get guests here. No, you can't shop here. You need to go somewhere else because you're, a trump supporter or your your you know, you're, not a Democrat. So in other words, you only represent a half of the country. You don't represent the whole country, no you're in the wrong job. You need to retire and go mix, knit yourself some scarves or something or find a hobby, because honey, a public servant serves the public, not just the ones that they want to support. This is ridiculous. I cannot believe. I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that I was terrified to make this video, because I was afraid. As an author and a writer, an independent writer author that I'm going to get trashed on Amazon Goodreads, because people don't like my politics, you don't know my politics. Yes, I walked away from the Democratic Party because of violence because of anger, because I hate, because a group think because of identity politics. Let me tell you something to all my brothers and sisters out there in the world and in America, especially there are no minorities. Not in this group. We don't have minorities in the street. We have Americans. If you see yourself as a minority as a victim or anything like that. That means. Let me let me come here. Let me give you a hug because you're an American, and just because of your sexual orientation, the color of your skin, your your race, whatever that doesn't make you any different from me. We just look different. We just live different, we're all Americans. This has to stop. We can't keep separating ourselves from each other. This way we have to love one another support one another we have to be together and just I had to walk away, because free speech is is one of the most important things in this country. It's what makes this country great if you want to go out and protest for something that you believe in that's something that you believe. You know that we all need to pay attention to. Please do we carry signs that say you know peace and love, and you know we need to look. We need to reach out to people whatever you know, but when you gonna stand up there and attack people and saw people and threatened people and call people all names and accuse them of all these horrible things that are just completely untrue, then you there's something wrong with you. There's something broken inside of you, but you know what you can fix it. You can fix it, take a step back tongue. You know, unplug, try, try listening know, maybe you may never. You know think that you know your beliefs, you may never change your beliefs and you have every right to have every belief that you want. However, when your beliefs infringe on my rights and my family's rights and my friends rights and my fellow Americans rights, that's where we're gonna have a problem, because more and more people are gonna be walking away because they don't want to get beat up. They don't want to get threatened. They don't want to be called names. They don't want to be treated like second-class citizens. They don't want their public servants only serving half the country. The only thing that is going to save this country is love and an acceptance and understanding that we're all different, but we're all the same. You."
39,31pyCFPOTVY,[Music] good morning walk away movement I hope you all are doing well this weekend I know it's been such a tough time and I was watching Brandon struts video over the weekend and he asked those of us who are either a walk with or a walk away to do a video I am a walk with for the most part I have voted Republican since college my first time to vote was in the presidential election and I did vote for Bill Clinton and obviously have regretted that ever since what has led me in my life to be a Republican is because I had family members who own businesses and were ranchers and just seeing the importance of having some basic liberties and also to not be taxed to where you can't reach your full potential and so as I've gotten older it went beyond the principles of just fiscal issues to social issues for me and wanting to protect the unborn and just I think also just respect for life and liberty has just become so important to me and it's been really proven to be a principle that just is essential for a successful country we are rapidly losing our liberties through the shutdown process and I'm just so concerned about that and so I'm very grateful for our governor McMaster who is starting to open up our state and we're going to go to Savannah today this show support for governor camp and it's tough I mean and no one's probably going to look great in a crisis and but I think at the end of the day we need to let our biz make some decisions for themselves and let the individuals to this is one of the reasons why I am a conservative it's to conserve life and liberty and I have like other members of this movement lost friends over the years because of my values and beliefs and even though we didn't talked about them they just knew I was a Republican and so because of that I had some friends just they walked away from me and it's painful it does hurt and what I have decided to do is the doors always open and I think about how Brandon kept the door open for his friend in Nebraska she kept the door open to him which led to this movement if she had unfriended him on Facebook he would not have found evidence of the bias in the media against our president and so I think that keeping the door open keeping the lines of communication even if people don't agree with us and they leave if even if they're not super nice either about it and if they are a friend they will come back and if not it's okay to let them go and I just think this movement is wonderful so proud of Brandon his courage and his strength and energy and I just hope you all will be fine the situation actually will be more than fine we'll come out victorious on the other side of this and I think the principles of life and liberty are what will unite us all we are not perfect the Republican Party is not perfect just like there's no such thing as a perfect family a perfect church perfect person so we have to give each other a lot of grace and forgiveness and mercy and just hold to those founding principles of life and liberty and I will add love into that as well and though that is what will keep us together and make our movement successful I wish you all a very happy Sunday and I hope we get to the other side of this year very soon love you all goodbye,"[Music] good morning walk away movement. I hope you all are doing well this weekend. I know it's been such a tough time and I was watching Brandon struts video over the weekend, and he asked those of us who are either a walk with or a walk away to do. A video I am a walk with, for the most part, I have voted Republican since college. My first time to vote was in the presidential election and I did vote for Bill Clinton and obviously have regretted that ever since what has led me in my life to be a Republican is because I had family members who own businesses and were ranchers and just seeing the importance of having some basic liberties and also to not be taxed, to where you can't reach your full potential, and so as I've gotten older. It went beyond the principles of just fiscal issues, to social issues for me and wanting to protect the unborn and just I think also just respect for life and liberty has just become so important to me, and it's been really proven to be a principle that just is essential for a successful country. We are rapidly losing our liberties through the shutdown process and I'm just so concerned about that, and so I'm very grateful for our governor McMaster, who is starting to open up our state and we're going to go to Savannah today. This show support for governor camp and it's tough I mean and no one's probably going to look great in a crisis and but I think at the end of the day, we need to let our biz make some decisions for themselves and let the individuals to this is one of the reasons why I am a conservative. It's to conserve life and liberty and I have like other members of this movement lost friends over the years because of my values and beliefs, and even though we didn't talked about them, they just knew I was a Republican, and so because of that I had some friends just they walked away from me and it's painful. It does hurt and what I have decided to do is the doors always open and I think about how Brandon kept the door open for his friend in Nebraska. She kept the door open to him which led to this movement. If she had unfriended him on Facebook, he would not have found evidence of the bias in the media against our president and so I think that keeping the door open, keeping the lines of communication. Even if people don't agree with us and they leave. If even if they're not super nice, either about it, and if they are a friend, they will come back and if not, it's okay to let them go and I just think. This movement is wonderful, so proud of Brandon, his courage and his strength and energy and I just hope. You all will be fine. The situation actually will be more than fine, we'll come out victorious on the other side of this and I think the principles of life and liberty are what will unite us all. We are not perfect. The Republican Party is not perfect, just like there's no such thing as a perfect family, a perfect church, perfect person, so we have to give each other a lot of grace and forgiveness and mercy and just hold to those founding principles of life and liberty and I will add, love into that as well, and though that is what will keep us together and make our movement successful. I wish you all a very happy, Sunday and I hope we get to the other side of this year. Very soon, love you all goodbye."

I am a gen xer, I'm actually around brandon's age, very cool brandon, I'm so inspired by you um, I'm 42 years old um. I just really want to encourage you baby boomers, your children. Yes, they are very angry um our generation sociogen xers, are very angry. We want accountability yeah, we are actually more conservative than the baby boomer generation um, and we also want to see change and we have seen before obama and we saw after obama and it's very scary for us. The millennials and this woke generation have not lived through some of the best years or some of the I wouldn't say besters, but some of the better years prior to obama. I went through the eight years of our recession and eight years of war, obama was eight years of war. That is how my generation at least my peers. All we view obama is as a war president. I am mexican armenian. I worked for the government. I worked for the california government in a county position. I was a clinical supervisor, I'm a licensed therapist, and let me tell you this: our mental health is one of the greatest unspoken issues that our country has and instead of addressing it, what we have done is we've dumped money into our prisons. We've dumped money into our juvenile court systems. We have dumped so much money into these potential, even like in our you know: um life sentencing prisons and trying to life sentence people, whereas we could do so much to help our young families, the children and these young families. We need to work on working on our fathers, the fathers, the black population, is missing five generations of fathers and we need to work on that and the problem is that the democrats they say they are, but they have not. Instead, they have locked up most of our families that are especially the mexicans who have a lot of alcohol drug addiction. All I really personally, my experience has been a lot of it's related to mental illness breakdown of families, and it has not been addressed. You would think that, after all the trillions of dollars that democrats have used that they would have fixed our problem or addressed the problem or decreased the problem, but no they have not, and I can tell you working for the government. They have not they're in debt, they have caused california to be in so much debt. I mean it's just ridiculous to me and I'm just like. We should not have these problems anymore, where what have you guys done? What have they done? That's my question. California, high homeless, high taxes and yet what are we seeing higher crimes? I just don't. I just makes no sense to me at all, so I want to encourage you if you're, a gen, xer and you're fed up what is what we think has been working has not, and so all we have to do right is what does it say? You don't keep going back to the same vomit over and over and over again thinking that if you eat the vomit again, it's going to be changed. It's not going to change it's the same vomit, I'm sorry! We have to change things. We have to change who we vote, for we have to change what we think and we need to look at things in a different perspective than we have before and ask people to help us and that's exactly what we're doing we're going to the republican party and saying look. We need some help here and I really believe my family, a lot of family is republican. I've walked away, 2006, 2007 and talking to them. I own two businesses. Now two businesses, I'm a business owner now, and I can tell you, socialism does not work handouts, do not work, we need. We need to get this fixed and I'm really hopeful. I'm very hopeful that our gen xers, this new generation coming up will be more conservative and will make better decisions for our country. It is evident in all these new senators and representatives that are being voted in, hopefully I'm praying and believing that they'll be voted in november third and that will have a new um new blood coming into the republican party and for those of you who have been in the republican party for a long time. May I encourage you, please keep your arms open wide for them. They're very hurt, we're very angry and we may not talk like you. Do we may not think like you do, but we are all on the same page fighting for the same thing and that is for our country. So let's keep the eyes on the prize and let's go forward. God bless you all. You."

42,3cXmSBsJ2og,hello my name is Pete Holmberg and this is my walk away video if I was to do a hashtag for myself and not the hashtag Brandon so brilliantly came up with I would call it the walk back home movement for myself because I was a Republican from a very early age I volunteered on George HW Bush's primary campaign in 1980 and then I registered as a Republican when I turned 18 in Chicago and I remained a Republican until I moved to New York when I was 25 years old and 1992 and people told me when I moved here if you want to be relevant you've got to be a Democrat in this town and I thought well if I wander stay irrelevant I would've stayed in Chicago so I registered as a Democrat and that year I voted for Bill Clinton my first democratic president that I voted for and I remained a Democrat I'll be it a Democrat who voted for a lot of Republicans I voted for Giuliani I voted for Bloomberg I voted for Governor Pataki I pretty much mixed it up but I voted for all Democratic presidents through Secretary Clinton and then on November 8th 2016 i sat there and I was in shock I was in shock and I was worried I had a lot of reason during the campaign I felt to be worried about Donald Trump I thought he would get us into nuclear war I thought he would get us into a recession he is done neither and I'm very pleasantly shocked and surprised by President Trump as president and his performance but the night of November 8th 2016 I did not know that I would be pleasantly surprised I was devastated of that night and I thought I just didn't understand how it could happen and so I came home and after President Trump gave his acceptance speech I did find myself feeling relieved because there had been a lot of speculation that the results would be did that the election would go on forever I remember what 2000 was like with bush and gore I did not want to relive that and so I was relieved at least that the issue was settled it was a very ugly campaign and I was glad it was over and I was also in all honesty grateful to live in a country where at least one person had voted for the president so I went on to Facebook about 320 in the morning and I effectively said you are my president president elect Trump congratulations in your hard-won victory you have my prayers my support god bless america I meant that I was truly grateful in that moment to be in to live in a democratic country and the blowback personally to me kind of offline was was nasty and it it kind of opened my eyes to the bigotry of the left and I started doing research I started reading I wanted to make sense of why he won because it didn't make sense to me the night had happened and I talked to a lot of people ended up talking to very smart very compassionate Trump voters and I was kind of reminded of why I had become a Republican in the first place it's because I value absolutely freedom of the individual overseas you know social engineering frankly and I'm not a big fan of people sitting in the sento centralization of power and remote power I don't I'm not a fan of that never have been but I'm gay so when I became a Democrat it felt natural do 92 and then when gay marriage really when I was young gay marriage was just like it was like us all of us I mean people talked about two men getting married the same way you would talk about a UFO landing it was the same level of probability so when gay marriage really became a legitimate issue when people started talking about marriage equality and when you know certain states like Massachusetts and then there was talk of Hawaii at one point I was not going to leave the Democratic Party when the Democratic Party was the only party even though Obama and were against gay marriage in 2008 if you were for gay marriage you had to be a Democrat that's where it was happening and that's ultimately who made it happen there's talk that in New York State a lot of Republicans just one of the issue gone and so they went to come on said well let's get this taken care of and I believe that but let's keep giving credit where credit is due marriage equality was a democratic issue and the Democrats helped me to propel it along but that's one issue and there are a lot of other issues that factor in in today's world and after the election of Donald Trump trying to make sense of the election of Donald Trump I really got back in touch with those issues and people explain things to me and I did a lot of reading I did a lot of reading on my own and seeing where country is going the role that immigration was playing how people were using immigration and I came to a lot of conclusions on my own and it wasn't so much a rejection of a Democratic Party although I did see a lot of dysfunction there that I was never comfortable with but I believe in individual liberty I believe that all of us were just born with inherent rights and we need to keep the government from infringing on those rights government doesn't give us rights were born with that that's how I really truly believe that and I also believe in diversity of thought one of the reasons I was drawn back to the Republican Party which I registered as a Republican just over a year ago is that you don't know in the Republican Party you have to ask someone are you pro-choice do you pro-life because they're both people there you've got to ask on all the issues there's true diversity of thought and to me that's an incredibly interesting place to be and it's the most natural place to be there is no group thank the Republican Party you do most likely you can't assume that anyone's coming from any one place and that's a great that that's a good place to be it's in two for me so for me coming back to the Republican Party after the election of Donald Trump was certainly interesting a lot of people like why now but seeing President Trump what he's done getting beyond the personality and the Twitter and all that stuff and to the actual results and the resolve that has made a lot of sense to me and I'm very proud to be a Republican I'm very proud to be a trump supporter I did not think I'd be saying that ever and one thing I definitely didn't think I'd be saying in the age of Trump is that I'm running for office shortly after coming back to the Republican Party I was recruited by the Manhattan GOP to run for state Senate and you're new here in Manhattan in Trump's district district 28 so I am the Republican candidate for New York state Senate I'm also the Reform Party candidate and we're on the stop de Blasio line and hopefully the independence line and you know will make things happen but this has been a very interesting time for me coming back to the Republican Party walking away from the Democratic Party and getting to a place where people can really tell the truth the Republican Party is a big tent party there are a lot of different opinions and I love that and feel very at home there I always did if I hadn't been if I hadn't been gay I probably would never have left the Republican Party to be honest and it doesn't throw my death the Republicans were not open to gay people for a very long time it doesn't thrill me but I don't judge people that what happened ten years ago I don't judge my boyfriends by what they did ten years ago I'm not going to judge my political party by what they did ten years ago what's important now in any decision whether it be a personal relationship or a political party for me is what is happening now what is happening today and I see the Republican Party being the party that's really protecting the American people and the future of the American people and the freedom of the American people to say whatever the heck they want the party of the first amendment is the Republican Party in my opinion these days and freedom of speech is everything to me it's the most important thing so I'm Pete Holmberg I'm a walk away candidate I'm the Republican candidate for New York State Senate in district 28 and I am proud to have walked away and walked home to the Republican Party thank you hello my name is Pete Holmberg and this is my walk away video if I was to do a hashtag for myself and not the hashtag Brandon so brilliantly came up with I would call it the walk back home movement for myself because I was a Republican from a very early age I volunteered on George HW Bush's primary campaign in 1980 and then I registered as a Republican when I turned 18 in Chicago and I remained a Republican until I moved to New York when I was 25 years old and 1992 and people told me when I moved here if you want to be relevant you've got to be a Democrat in this town and I thought well if I wander stay irrelevant I would've stayed in Chicago so I registered as a Democrat and that year I voted for Bill Clinton my first democratic president that I voted for and I remained a Democrat I'll be it a Democrat who voted for a lot of Republicans I voted for Giuliani I voted for Bloomberg I voted for Governor Pataki I pretty much mixed it up but I voted for all Democratic presidents through Secretary Clinton and then on November 8th 2016 i sat there and I was in shock I was in shock and I was worried I had a lot of reason during the campaign I felt to be worried about Donald Trump I thought he would get us into nuclear war I thought he would get us into a recession he is done neither and I'm very pleasantly shocked and surprised by President Trump as president and his performance but the night of November 8th 2016 I did not know that I would be pleasantly surprised I was devastated of that night and I thought I just didn't understand how it could happen and so I came home and after President Trump gave his acceptance speech I did find myself feeling relieved because there had been a lot of speculation that the results would be did that the election would go on forever I remember what 2000 was like with bush and gore I did not want to relive that and so I was relieved at least that the issue was settled it was a very ugly campaign and I was glad it was over and I was also in all honesty grateful to live in a country where at least one person had voted for the president so I went on to Facebook about 320 in the morning and I effectively said you are my president president elect Trump congratulations in your hard-won victory you have my prayers my support god bless america I meant that I was truly grateful in that moment to be in to live in a democratic country and the blowback personally to me kind of offline was was nasty and it it kind of opened my eyes to the bigotry of the left and I started doing research I started reading I wanted to make sense of why he won because it didn't make sense to me the night had happened and I talked to a lot of people ended up talking to very smart very compassionate Trump voters and I was kind of reminded of why I had become a Republican in the first place it's because I value absolutely freedom of the individual overseas you know social engineering frankly and I'm not a big fan of people sitting in the sento centralization of power and remote power I don't I'm not a fan of that never have been but I'm gay so when I became a Democrat it felt natural do 92 and then when gay marriage really when I was young gay marriage was just like it was like us all of us I mean people talked about two men getting married the same way you would talk about a UFO landing it was the same level of probability so when gay marriage really became a legitimate issue when people started talking about marriage equality and when you know certain states like Massachusetts and then there was talk of Hawaii at one point I was not going to leave the Democratic Party when the Democratic Party was the only party

What is happening today and I see the Republican Party being the party, that's really protecting the American people and the future of the American people and the freedom of the American people to say whatever the heck they want.

I did not think I'd be saying that ever and one thing I definitely didn't think I'd be saying in the age of Trump is that I'm running for office. Shortly after coming back to the Republican Party I was recruited by the Manhattan GOP to run for state Senate and you're new here in Manhattan in Trump's district district 28. So I am the Republican candidate for New, York, state, Senate, I'm, also the Reform Party candidate and we're on the stop de Blasio line, and hopefully the independence line, and you know will make things happen. But this has been a very interesting time for me. Coming back to the Republican Party walking away from the Democratic Party and getting to a place where people can really tell the truth. The Republican Party is a big tent party. There are a lot of different opinions and I love that and feel very at home. There I always did if I hadn't been if I hadn't been gay. I probably would never have left the Republican Party to be honest and it doesn't throw my death. The Republicans were not open to gay people for a very long time. It doesn't thrill me but I, don't judge people that what happened ten years ago, I, don't judge my boyfriends by what they did ten years ago, I'm not going to judge my political party by what they did ten years ago. What's important now in any decision, whether it be a personal relationship or a political party for me is what is happening now. What is happening today and I see the Republican Party being the party, that's really protecting the American people and the future of the American people and the freedom of the American people to say whatever the heck they want. The party of the first amendment is the Republican Party. In my opinion, these days and freedom of speech is everything to me. It's the most important thing, so I'm Pete, Holmberg I'm, a walk away: candidate, I'm, the Republican candidate for New, York, State Senate in district 28 and I am proud to have walked away and walked home to the Republican Party. Thank you, hello. My name is Pete Holmberg, and this is my walk away. Video if I was to do a hashtag for myself and not the hashtag Brandon, so brilliantly came up with I would call it the walk back home movement for myself, because I was a Republican from a very early age. I volunteered on George, HW, Bush's primary campaign in 1980 and then I registered as a Republican when I turned 18 in Chicago and I remained a Republican until I moved to New York when I was 25 years old and 1992, and people told me when I moved here. If you want to be relevant, you've got to be a Democrat in this town and I thought. Well, if I wander stay, irrelevant, I would've stayed in Chicago, so I registered as a Democrat and that year I voted for Bill Clinton. My first democratic president that I voted for and I remained a Democrat I'll, be it a Democrat who voted for a lot of Republicans I voted for Giuliani I voted for Bloomberg I voted for Governor Pataki I, pretty much mixed it up, but I voted for all Democratic presidents through Secretary Clinton and then on November, 8th 2016. I sat there and I was in shock. I was in shock and I was worried. I had a lot of reason during the campaign. I felt to be worried about Donald Trump I thought he would get us into nuclear war. I thought he would get us into a recession. He is done neither and I'm very pleasantly, shocked and surprised by President Trump as president and his performance, but the night of November, 8th, 2016 I did not know that I would be pleasantly surprised. I was devastated of that night and I thought I just didn't understand how it could happen, and so I came home and after President Trump gave his acceptance speech. I did find myself feeling relieved because there had been a lot of speculation, that the results would be did that the election would go on forever. I remember what 2000 was like with bush and gore. I did not want to relive that, and so I was relieved at least that the issue was settled. It was a very ugly campaign and I was glad. It was over and I was also in all honesty, grateful to live in a country where at least one person had voted for the president, so I went on to Facebook about 320 in the morning and I effectively said you are. My president president elect Trump. Congratulations in your hard-won victory! You have my prayers. My support, god bless. America. I meant that I was truly grateful in that moment to be in to live in a democratic country and the blowback personally to me, kind of offline was was nasty and it it kind of opened my eyes to the bigotry of the left and I started. Doing research I started. Reading I wanted to make sense of why he won, because it didn't make sense to me. The night had happened and I talked to a lot of people ended up talking to very smart, very compassionate Trump voters and I was kind of reminded of why I had become a Republican in the first place. It's because I value, absolutely freedom of the individual overseas. You know social engineering frankly and I'm, not a big fan of people sitting in the sento centralization of power and remote power. I, don't I'm, not a fan of that, never have been, but I'm gay. So when I became a Democrat, it felt natural do 92 and then, when gay marriage really when I was young, gay marriage was just like it was like us all of us. I mean people talked about two men getting married the same way. You would talk about a UFO landing. It was the same level of probability. So when gay marriage really became a legitimate issue, when people started talking about marriage equality and when you know certain states like Massachusetts and then there was talk of Hawaii at one point, I was not going to leave the Democratic Party when the Democratic Party was the only party, even though Obama and were against gay marriage in 2008. If you were for gay marriage, you had to be a Democrat, that's where it was happening and that's ultimately, who made it happen. There's talk that in New, York State a lot of Republicans just one of the issue gone, and so they went to come on said well. Let's get this taken care of and I believe that. But let's keep giving credit where credit is due. Marriage equality was a democratic issue and the Democrats helped me to propel it along. But that's one issue, and there are a lot of other issues that factor in in today's world and after the election of Donald Trump, trying to make sense of the election of Donald Trump I really got back in touch with those issues and people explain things to me and I did a lot of reading. I did a lot of reading on my own and seeing where country is going, the role that immigration was playing, how people were using immigration and I came to a lot of conclusions on my own and it wasn't so much a rejection of a Democratic Party, although I did see a lot of dysfunction there, that I was never comfortable with, but I believe in individual liberty. I believe that all of us were just born with inherent rights and we need to keep the government from infringing on those rights. Government doesn't give us rights were born with that. That's how I really truly believe that and I also believe in diversity of thought. One of the reasons I was drawn back to the Republican Party, which I registered as a Republican just over a year ago. Is that you don't know in the Republican Party, you have to ask someone: are you pro-choice? Do you pro-life because they're both people there you've got to ask on all the issues? There's true diversity of thought and to me that's an incredibly interesting place to be, and it's the most natural place to be. There is no group thank the Republican Party. You do most likely. You can't assume that anyone's coming from any one place, and that's a great that that's a good place to be it's in two for me. So for me, coming back to the Republican Party after the election of Donald, Trump was certainly interesting. A lot of people like why now, but seeing President Trump what he's done getting beyond the personality and the Twitter and all that stuff and to the actual results and the resolve that has made a lot of sense to me and I'm very proud to be a Republican I'm, very proud to be a trump supporter. I did not think I'd be saying that ever and one thing I definitely didn't think I'd be saying in the age of Trump. Is that I'm running for office shortly after coming back to the Republican Party I was recruited by the Manhattan GOP to run for state Senate and you're new here in Manhattan in Trump's district district 28, so I am the Republican candidate for New, York, state, Senate, I'm, also the Reform Party candidate and we're on the stop de Blasio line, and hopefully the independence line, and you know will make things happen.

I just want to say it and also my mom's voting for trump too she's going to drop off her ballot soon, pretty soon, once yeah she's going to drop off pretty soon and also I vote for lauren cope for governor of washington state right now in seattle and here's. My reason why I voted for I'm gonna vote for trump officially vote for trump. First of all, I was not very happy when he won 2016. I wasn't like those meltdown people who pretty much like was yelling screaming. I was not like that, even though I'm not really a trump fan, but today I felt that some of these policies weren't as bad as these less people said and also the media, the media the way the mainstream trump. Is it really pretty much disgusts me and I'm sick of it, and also you see the far left, how their how how they act towards trump supporters. Like thing, is you don't no one's forcing you to agree with trump on everything? No one like no same person will agree with trouble and everything their acts his behavior, but at the same time like like look, why don't you ever look at the other side and figure out yourself like try to listen to the other side? That's my problem before I left today that, like they're, not capable of holding any civil conversations with conservatives, the moderates are anyone who doesn't support democrats, which is why they're gonna, I hope for a red landslide. So they can actually humble themselves a bit. So I'm looking forward to the election, I hope trump wins both the electoral vote, as well as the popular vote. I have no regrets voting for donald trump, because he's the only one that's gonna do again do stick. You're gonna stand up against the chinese communist party. As you haven't seen my vocal video, I'm an immigrant from hong kong and pretty much what is happening in hong kong is one vote for trump. If it wasn't for hong kong, I was planning on voting, but because of hong kong. It gave me a good reason for me and my mom to vote for trump and china jill's not gonna, do anything all these democrats are kissing china's, but so screw them and also blm the whole violence about defunding police, killing, cops and every all these extremist acts. They also persuaded me to involve trump, because I don't want listen to those marxists like just because I don't support blm doesn't mean I don't support black lives. Just because I support white lives as well doesn't mean I support kkk, it's simple as that. How is all eyes matter? How does all eyes matter racist? I I don't understand, like you say, black lives, no lies matter in the black lives matter. That's the most racist stuff! I've ever heard. That's just pure nonsense like no one should fall for that. Believe me, you think all these riots are for george foreign, those like walter, wallace and those others get out of here. Man anyways, I have cast on my vote. I have no regrets and I've walked away fully from the ground democrats. I don't plan to vote for them again, short term. No there's no way and I'm glad I was able to convince my mom to vote for president trump. Unfortunately, my dad probably kind of vote for blind, but oh well, he's not living out about well, my dad's not living with us right now, he's still living in california, but we'll talk about that later, but anyways, I hope for rent landslide trump wins by at least I don't know how many electoral votes and hope he wins upon your vote too. So have a good night. Everyone and I look forward to the election. You."

it I'm getting old I'm retiring I'm going fishing so anyway I I think all of us are frustrated with our political parties and and that's what's cool here this is a an ability for all of us to come

It's like you, you're you're, passing on this debt that taxes are going to have to pay pay off and who's gonna pay. It I'm getting old, I'm retiring I'm, going fishing so anyway, I I, think all of us are frustrated with our political parties and and that's what's cool here. This is a an ability for all of us to come together and share our frustrations and I. Would just I want to talk about a couple of things. One is I just want to talk about. Well, I'm, an artist and I bet an artist. My whole life, almost 40 years, I've been a professional sculptor and designer and everybody the stereotypical things, a stereotyping just totally pisses me off people come in the studio and then they find out I'm a conservative and they go. What? How can you be a conservative you're, an artist you're an artist is a hysto a what? How can you be a conservative you're, a black, well you're, a a gay or your or your transgender or whatever it, and this is like something: that's gotta be kind of dealt with and and hashtag walk away is dealing with it in a wholesale manner in an intelligent manner. I'm honored everybody I've not heard one. Testimony that didn't touch my heart and the other thing of it is is that I think, what's really been great for me, is to see the gay community in a in a very honorable light and to see them in a way that, at you know just to get rid of my stereotypes. You know to get rid of my my bigotry or my let's just say: I'm guarded about it or I have traditional values, but hey guess what I'm honored to be a part with that with with Brandon, and all that that the gays that have had the courage to walk away from from ana party that takes them for granted and and by the same way I'm a white Christian male as you notice, I'm enemy number one, and so, if I walk away from the Republican Party. It's for the same reasons. I don't want anyone to take. Take me for granted or my vote and so I've learned a lot and and I think that the the that for sure, the social engineers of the Democratic Party and the far left have been driving a wedge between the the LGBTQ community and and the conservative social conservatives like myself and and it's been to by design, you know and I fell for it kind of you know. I was kind of like yeah, they said, but I think my feeling was that gays were kind of angry all the time and discontent and just and my whole thing about life is just to enjoy life to its fullest. No matter what, if no matter what this is a quick ride and I sure don't want to spend it being pissed off because of somebody's sexual orientation and so I'm growing up too, you know we're growing up and the places it seems to me like grown-ups, are coming to hashtag, walk away, to say: hey man, let's not get hurted into hatred, and we want to get out of the stereotypes and we want to hold each other's hand without fear. We want to because guess what we're all fighting for the right to be an individual I want to fight for the right people say: man you're, a weird dude man, you're strange I want to fight for the right to be that weirdo, okay and I know that's the thing and that's what we have in common is that we're also uniquely different and they can not handle. The left is not into people thinking differently than they do or to be an individual to really have outside opinions and ideas. They shut it down. They shut it down. Quick and they're. Gonna try and shut hashtag walk away down because guess what it's a force to be reckoned with? Greetings my brothers and sisters from the hashtag walkaway movement I'd like to thank our fearless awesome leader, Brandon Straka, for getting this thing going and allowing people to be able to share and their frustration with their political parties. I'm a happen to be a conservative Republican but I'm about ready to leave the Republican Party and walk away to becoming an independent, because they are not representing my values and in like. Let me give an example: the national debt is at 20 trillion dollars, I believe George Bush started that and then Barack Obama doubled or tripled it I, don't know he went. He went berserk spending, and here we are 20 trillion in the hole and that's I think a quarter of a million per well I've heard 90,000 per man, woman and child. It's a it's a lot of money and the problem is it's a form of, in my opinion, it's kind of like child abuse. It's like you, you're you're, passing on this debt that taxes are going to have to pay pay off and who's gonna pay. It I'm getting old, I'm retiring I'm, going fishing so anyway, I I, think all of us are frustrated with our political parties and and that's what's cool here.

What? How can you be a conservative you're, an artist you're an artist is a hysto a what. How can you be a conservative you're, a black, well you're, a a gay or your or your transgender or whatever it, and this is like something: that's gotta be kind of dealt with and and hashtag walk away is dealing with it in a wholesale manner in an intelligent manner.

46,3sIbGLcHLXk,uh today i want to talk to you about how i escaped the left and the crazy radical ideologies um just a little bit of background about myself i was never a political person um i voted for obama you know just like most minorities did just because he was black uh especially living in california los angeles i mean most of us always just vote democrat we don't even think about it um but it wasn't until this little covet lockdown situation uh that i really started getting more in tune with the topics of what's going on uh in politics and just in general so uh island small business the lockdown was ridiculous to me i noticed that costco and target and walmart all these other places are letting you know people come in there with masks thousands and thousands of people every day can walk through there plus all the employees touching all these products but yet a small mom-and-pop business or my small business or hair salon you know doesn't have the opportunity to be open when we have one fifth or one-twentieth the amount of foot traffic so that to me just set off all kind of red flags and i knew that something was obviously wrong so uh that got me to start doing more research and actually start watching more news channels and stuff like that and as i was watching the news cnn msnbc i just saw how much they just were bashing on trump all i heard was this like crying complaining just talking all this nonsense about trump and just angry all the time you know i didn't see any joy at all i didn't see any answers i just saw complaining so i would flip back and forth between cnn msnbc and granite i will always a democrat uh so as i start flipping back and forth between fox and cnn i'm saying well at least fox gives me a little bit more facts a little bit more substance not just all this uh ranting and emotion and just you know hating on trump so i was like okay what's really going on so i started doing my own research and looking for alternate news outlets on the internet and uh man i came across a bunch of good ones uh for example some of them are uh that you might already know if not uh definitely check out these guys uh thomas soul larry elder that definitely highly recommend watching the uncle tom movie great great movie about uh black conservatives in america prayer you tim paul ben carson uh ben shapiro dave rubin candace oh and stephen crowder uh officer tatum joel patrick um there's just a lot of a lot of good people out there that are really getting the real news out because honestly it is fake media out here and you got to be careful with your what you're watching nowadays so you know all this uh trump media you know we're talking about he's a racist he's a bigot he's a sexist he's uh anti-veteran he totally failed to recover well i saw that he had the travel ban in early january and pelosi is out in chinatown marching around talking about hey come out to chinatown it's all good you don't have to worry about coping you know just to make trump look stupid to be opposite of what he was saying and then all of a sudden now they're trying to say that he didn't you know do anything uh good as far as uh the pandemic and they're blaming everything on him nah i'm not buying it i mean you know you can't blame one man for a disease that's spread all over the world so again just more uh hate and uh you know disrespect basically towards uh president trump so you know i'm looking at that not buying it um i'm also looking at the lowest unemployment rates under donald trump for blacks latinos women everybody in general so what's really going on um he instituted the first step act which is groundbreaking prison reform for uh people that were overcharged and ninety percent of the people that were getting sentences reduced are black so how is it that you have a racist president but he's free and black people also he gave historical funding to hbcus uh for 10 years again black colleges this man is helping out the black community uh i see what he's done with the va reform he fired over 4 000 people that haven't been doing a great job at all for our veterans mental health medical health fired them uh our veterans deserve better and he's taking care of the veterans you look at what he did with isis okay [Music] he killed baghdadi destroyed him right cnn and they were talking about oh why did he do that he's going to be starting world war three now oh no why did he do that no no world war you know we're bringing our troops home uh fantastic job no more isis he uh also brokered three groundbreaking middle east peace deals again they got no credit for and all i see on cnn and msnbc are talking about how it was a distraction and it was just a business deal so i haven't heard like one legitimate good thing of praise for anything that he's done and nobody's that bad you're gonna just tell me because the guy tweets a lot and he has a loud mouth that you're not gonna look at his policies of the facts you guys are too worried about your feelings instead of worrying about the facts facts not feelings so let's talk about joel biden real quick so joe biden said that poor kids are just as talented as white kids okay but trump's supposed to be the racist and the big okay this came out of this man's mouth then he says if you don't vote for me you ain't black now at that point i was done with joe biden i was done with the left i'm done with the mainstream media [Music] they use us as pawns talking about racism racism racism victimization racism racism now if you work hard in america you can get anything you want you can achieve anything you want i'm a perfect example of that i'm a living test subject to that so at that point i changed my stance to conservative uh and i'm now a registered republican in california los angeles and one thing i really want to stress here is that the problem isn't so much with the left i mean it is but the main issue with america in general is that nobody has a godly worldview anymore and more specifically jesus christ um i'm a christian uh i believe in pro-life i'm not about that abortion stuff um i believe in the second amendment i believe that we should have our guns you see all these riots going on here i want to be able to protect my family in case people are going to try to run up at my house i want to be able to protect them you're going to tell me to take my gun away that just doesn't make any kind of sense to me at all why anybody would want to support the left um i'm into hard work i want limited government uh i'll take care of myself i don't need government all of my business let me just take care of my family i can't believe we're still locked down six months later uh you know over this thing that's killing uh point zero six of one percent the survival rate for covet in regards to the population is uh 99.96 okay what are we doing here locked up they're closing down my church can't go to church gavin news i'm talking about you know if you guys go to church he's going to cut the power off what's really going on okay this is like a spiritual warfare and obviously uh those of us that are conservative now we're in for the fight of our life and um so anyway i just think we need more god in our life and i just want to reiterate one more thing guys and always remember this the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge the fools despise wisdom and instruction proverbs 1 7 thanks for checking out my video,"Uh today I want to talk to you about how I escaped the left and the crazy radical ideologies. Um just a little bit of background about myself. I was never a political person um. I voted for obama, you know just like most minorities did just because he was black uh, especially living in california, los angeles. I mean most of us always just vote democrat. We don't even think about it um, but it wasn't until this little covet lockdown situation uh that I really started getting more in tune with the topics of what's going on uh in politics and just in general, so uh, island, small business. The lockdown was ridiculous to me. I noticed that costco and target and walmart all these other places are letting you know. People come in there with masks.

So uh that got me to start doing more research and actually start watching more news channels and stuff like that, and as I was watching the news, cnn msnbc, I just saw how much they just were bashing on trump. All I heard was this like crying complaining just talking all this nonsense about trump and just angry all the time you know, I didn't see any joy at all. I didn't see any answers I just saw complaining, so I would flip back and forth between cnn msnbc and granite. I will always a democrat uh. So, as I start flipping back and forth between fox and cnn, I'm saying well at least fox- gives me a little bit more facts a little bit more substance, not just all this uh ranting and emotion, and just you know, hating on trump. So I was like okay, what's really going on, so I started doing my own research and looking for alternate news outlets on the internet and uh man. I came across a bunch of good ones: uh, for example. Some of them are uh that you might already know, if not uh, definitely check out these guys. Uh thomas soul, larry elder that definitely highly recommend watching the uncle tom movie great great movie, about uh black conservatives in america, prayer, you, tim, paul, ben carson, uh ben shapiro, dave, rubin, candace, oh and stephen crowder, uh officer, tatum, joel patrick um, there's just a lot of a lot of good people out there that are really getting the real news out, because, honestly, it is fake media out here, and you got to be careful with your what you're watching nowadays. So you know all this uh trump media. You know we're talking about he's a racist he's, a bigot he's a sexist he's, uh anti-veteran. He totally failed to recover. Well, I saw that he had the travel ban in early january and pelosi is out in chinatown. Marching around talking about hey, come out to chinatown. It's all good. You don't have to worry about coping. You know just to make trump look stupid to be opposite of what he was saying and then all of a sudden now they're trying to say that he didn't you know, do anything uh good. As far as uh the pandemic and they're blaming everything on him, nah I'm not buying it. I mean you know you can't blame one man for a disease, that's spread all over the world. So again just more uh hate and uh. You know disrespect basically towards uh president trump, so you know I'm looking at that not buying it um, I'm also looking at the lowest unemployment rates under donald trump for blacks, latinos, women, everybody in general. So, what's really going on um, he instituted the first step act, which is groundbreaking. Prison reform for uh people that were overcharged, and ninety percent of the people that were getting sentences reduced are black. So how is it that you have a racist president, but he's free and black people? Also, he gave historical funding to hbcus uh for 10 years again, black colleges, this man is helping out the black community uh. I see what he's done with the va reform. He fired over 4 000 people that haven't been doing a great job at all for our veterans, mental health, medical health, fired them uh. Our veterans deserve better and he's taking care of the veterans. You look at what he did with isis: okay [Music]. He killed baghdadi destroyed him right cnn and they were talking about. Oh, why did he do that he's going to be starting world war? Three now? Oh! No! Why did he do that? No no world war! You know we're bringing our troops home, uh, fantastic job, no more isis! He uh also brokered three groundbreaking middle east peace deals again they got no credit for, and all I see on, cnn and msnbc are talking about how it was a distraction and it was just a business deal. So I haven't heard like one legitimate good thing of praise for anything that he's done and nobody's that bad you're gonna just tell me, because the guy tweets a lot and he has a loud mouth that you're not gonna. Look at his policies of the facts. You guys are too worried about your feelings instead of worrying about the facts. Facts not feelings! So let's talk about joel biden, real quick, so joe biden said that poor kids are just as talented as white, kids, okay, but trump's supposed to be the racist and the big okay. This came out of this man's mouth. Then he says, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black. Now. At that point I was done with joe biden. I was done with the left, I'm done with the mainstream media [Music]. They use us as pawns talking about racism, racism, racism, victimization, racism, racism. Now, if you work hard in america, you can get anything you want. You can achieve anything. You want I'm a perfect example of that. I'm a living test. Subject to that. So at that point I changed my stance to conservative uh and I'm now a registered republican in california, los angeles, and one thing I really want to stress here- is that the problem isn't so much with the left. I mean it is, but the main issue with america in general is that nobody has a godly worldview anymore and more specifically jesus christ, um, I'm a christian uh. I believe in pro-life I'm not about that abortion, stuff um. I believe in the second amendment. I believe that we should have our guns. You see all these riots going on here. I want to be able to protect my family in case people are going to try to run up at my house. I want to be able to protect them, you're, going to tell me to take my gun away. That just doesn't make any kind of sense to me at all why anybody would want to support the left um I'm into hard work. I want limited government uh I'll, take care of myself. I don't need government all of my business. Let me just take care of my family. I can't believe we're still locked down six months later. Uh, you know over this thing. That's killing uh point zero! Six of one percent, the survival rate for covet in regards to the population is uh 99.96. Okay, what are we doing here? Locked up, they're, closing down my church can't go to church gavin news, I'm talking about you know if you guys go to church, he's going to cut the power off what's really going on. Okay, this is like a spiritual warfare and obviously uh those of us that are conservative, now we're in for the fight of our life and um.

47,3tzIPOW1OcA,hello everyone this is my walk away video been nervous to do this but i figured why not do it just do it no makeup no nothing just do it i'm waiting in line to pick up my kids so i have a little bit of time so my name is renee kitchikova i was born in um well 1982 in bulgaria when it was still under communist rule and even before that let me go back to when my dad was little when he was five years old he told his mom he said when i grow up i'm gonna live in america and he was so proud of himself and she slapped him across the face and she said don't ever talk like that you see in a communist country you're not supposed to know about western civil civilizations um there was like two channels if there was even tv but when i was little there was like two channels that you can watch and everything's propaganda and everything's so controlled when my parents were growing up in those days if you wear any kind of western um so like bell bottoms or anything like that you can be put in camp but i mean these are it's not camp it's like it's like jail like if you like the communist camps like the their political camps and all these things they're really like jails um one of the first things that communists do is they take away church so when i was little um my parents didn't were not religious they were not allowed to go to church my grandparents were not allowed to go to church so this was many this was generations um but my great-grandparents that generation that was almost completely had died off by that time they were still allowed to go to church so when i was one my great-grandma took me in to get baptized because that generation was the last generation that was allowed to go to church and and just think about taking religion away um i didn't grow up with any religion i didn't grow up with any dogmas anything like that and neither did my parents or my grandparents so um so that's one thing to think about it's just not there there's no higher power there's nothing talked about that's that's uh faith or um anything positive that will get you through hard situations it's like hush hush right you there is not you just look to the government to tell you what to think to tell you what to do um you wait in long lines to get your food i remember being so little and my aunt she went and got bananas okay you wait in line there's one time during the year you can get bananas and you wait in line you get your bag of bananas and she sat us down me and my cousin and she said eat the bananas i must have been probably three or four and we sat there and we had to eat all the bananas before they went bad and to this day i hate bananas but that's the that's that was life you know that's how things were and um when i was four years old i remember my parents i walked past their room and it was very uh there was a lot of like tension in the room my parent my mom was crying their suitcases were packed i think at this time i mean what they were going through and i walked in there and i asked my mom i said what's going on where are you going and she put me on her lap and she said don't worry we're not going anywhere everything's okay and she sent me off to bed the next day my parents were gone they escaped now they couldn't tell anyone they couldn't tell me obviously they couldn't tell anyone what was going on um my aunt who was 20 years old at the time going through a divorce she was married at 15 she was going through a divorce she was emotionally unavailable to take care of me and my cousin so she was there for me but i had my parents were gone they left are when the government found out that they had left because it was so dangerous they couldn't take me with them i mean they would have captured them and put them in political prison and forgotten about them forever there was just it was unheard of to escape during that time very few people escaped my dad had a job at a ship so he worked on ships where he traveled to like africa and down the mediterranean so he saw different countries he saw he saw a glimpse that most did not so that gave him the idea of how to escape because he came in with the mission to leave and move to america one day he literally came in with that mission he was a system buster in the system the communist system couldn't keep him and so my mom had faith they had faith even with no religion they had faith and they escaped and i remember during that time my grandma was married to a westerner a czech slovakian man so she was able to travel to the western world western world she was able to travel to austria and different places like that and so she was able to come and visit me but they wouldn't really let her any anymore once my parents escaped my grandma couldn't come visit me and i remember government agents coming and patting me on the head when i was in daycare to make sure that the gov that my parents didn't find a way to smuggle me that my grandma didn't come and take me on the train and leave with me to austria like they kept her um they wouldn't let her leave bulgaria until the government made sure i was still in daycare that was one of the last times she visited me um so they wouldn't let her leave until they made sure that i was in school and then they called the station said okay she's okay to leave so these kind of tactics they had our phones tapped anytime my parents would call they found out where my parents are they would tell them that they're never gonna see their daughter again that they're traitors to the country i mean just some of the worst things that you can possibly say to someone um and and my parents went through a lot and and they they escaped because they it was worth it for them they wanted a better life for themselves and eventually me i mean they didn't know if they were going to see me again my grandma fought for me she moved to austria and was able to go to the the embassy there and they fought for me my parents had no rights they were immigrants and refugees but my grandma had rights and she fought with me for me and eventually two years later they were able to they fought for me so much that the communist government was not allowed to hold me anymore they had to give me a passport and they waited until my parents passport was about to expire so my parents they knew all the information they knew that my parents had to leave austria to go to canada and they waited until the day they left for canada to release me so i can be away from my parents even longer several months more like they they did those things on purpose my grandma when she fought for me they told her that only the communists will keep a child away from her parents and that's the way they do it um so finally they were able to release me i was reunited with my grandma but that i thought i was gonna be reunited with my parents i forgot what they look like i forgot who they were i forgot their voices um two years without them so i turned six in austria and had an amazing time with my grandma there and then um several months later i finally was reunited with my parents i flew on a plane by myself from austria to canada and that's where my parents were and i was finally reunited and all of that all of that was worth it to come to this country we are now in america and my dad was able to build a life the american dream for us i have two siblings now and um we grew up here i grew up in canada and i from the age of 13 have lived here in the united states and he built one of the largest companies a plumbing company and it was you know he had offices from california to florida and he built that american dream for us he knew he wanted freedom he knew he wanted to live in a country where you can build and create the life of your dreams and um that's my story i i grew up here i never thought i would be so proud to be american i never really looked at all this the the things that happened and put them all together until now i came here thinking wow i thought this would be freedom but it never really felt too free it felt very corrupted in the government sections you know i didn't care much about government i didn't care much about politics none of that stuff never really looked into it and it just felt it still felt communist it still felt like it was controlled and then it wasn't until you know uh hillary and and trump were running and i thought that night i went to bed thinking there's no way trump would win he's an independent he's he's not a part of the system hillary's a shoe-in but it's so corrupted it's so planned beforehand that no one has a chance if they're not in it like she has been in it and i secretly wanted trump to win but i still didn't believe in politics enough to even um a vote i i recently became registered to vote for the first time this year i'm going to vote for trump of course um but i can't say i was a walk away because i was never a walk i was never a democrat i was never anything i didn't care about any of it that morning when i woke up i went to bed thinking there is no way trump will win i woke up thinking wow we literally just jumped into a new paradigm what a shift in consciousness like we shift timelines it felt so surreal that trump even got in and i started paying attention from that moment on i started paying attention what is going on i knew the wikileaks i i knew all the stuff i'm intuitive enough to know about everything and where to look for information so i knew what was going on with all of it i had just and then you know when when the information started coming out and when trump started talking about the stuff that we all knew but was hidden for so long i started paying attention and i've never been more involved or more um i just learned about politics like like it's my job like every day i'm doing homework politics marxism i mean learning about what what's what is this ideology that has taken over the world right um this communism marxism socialism whatever you want to call it it's the same and people have died to escape it we are here everyone that's here in this great country they have escaped that ideology we're all system busters we're all you know we're like the rebels and we all made it here and our our ancestors fought so hard to get here don't ever forget that we don't even know the freedom that we have until we've experienced life in those countries and you will fight to the death to get this freedom and people don't understand that here nobody gets it the younger generations don't get it my generation doesn't get it you know it's but the plan is amazing i mean they have done a good job of brainwashing people the news and everything is propaganda it's the same tech tactics the same same same same and um people from about 20 years ago have started hating america and and switching and and now being used to bring in those same ideologies they're being tricked and we have to open our eyes and see it for what it is it's important that trump wins and i'm really proud and excited to go and vote for the first time and that's my story and um love you all bye,"Hello everyone. This is my walk away. Video been nervous to do this, but I figured why not do it just do it? No makeup? No, nothing! Just do it. I'm waiting in line to pick up my kids, so I have a little bit of time, so my name is renee kitchikova. I was born in um, well 1982 in bulgaria, when it was still under communist rule, and even before that, let me go back to when my dad was little when he was five years old. He told his mom. He said when I grow up. I'm gonna live in america and he was so proud of himself and she slapped him across the face and she said don't ever talk like that. You see in a communist country you're not supposed to know about western civil civilizations um. There was like two channels if there was even tv, but when I was little there was like two channels that you can watch and everything's propaganda and everything's so controlled when my parents were growing up in those days, if you wear any kind of western um. So like bell bottoms or anything like that, you can be put in camp, but I mean these: are it's not camp? It's like it's like jail like if you like, the communist camps, like the their political camps and all these things they're really like jails, um one of the first things that communists do. Is they take away church? So when I was little um, my parents didn't were not religious, they were not allowed to go to church. My grandparents were not allowed to go to church, so this was many. This was generations um, but my great-grandparents that generation that was almost completely had died off. By that time they were still allowed to go to church. So when I was one my great-grandma took me in to get baptized, because that generation was the last generation that was allowed to go to church and and just think about taking religion away um, I didn't grow up with any religion. I didn't grow up with any dogmas, anything like that, and neither did my parents or my grandparents so um. So that's one thing to think about it's: just not there there's no higher power. There's nothing talked about. That's that's uh, faith or um, anything positive that will get you through hard situations. It's like hush, hush right! You there is not! You just look to the government to tell you what to think to tell you what to do. Um. You wait in long lines to get your food, I remember being so little and my aunt she went and got bananas. Okay. You wait in line there's one time during the year you can get bananas and you wait in line. You get your bag of bananas and she sat us down me and my cousin and she said, eat the bananas. I must have been probably three or four and we sat there and we had to eat all the bananas before they went bad and to this day I hate bananas, but that's the that's that was life. You know that's how things were and um. When I was four years old. I remember my parents, I walked past their room and it was very uh. There was a lot of like tension in the room. My parent, my mom, was crying. Their suitcases were packed. I think at this time I mean what they were going through and I walked in there, and I asked my mom I said what's going on: where are you going and she put me on her lap and she said: don't worry we're not going anywhere everything's, okay and she sent me off to bed the next day. My parents were gone, they escaped now. They couldn't tell anyone, they couldn't tell me. Obviously they couldn't tell anyone what was going on um, my aunt, who was 20 years old at the time going through a divorce. She was married at 15. She was going through a divorce. She was emotionally unavailable to take care of me and my cousin, so she was there for me, but I had my parents were gone. They left are when the government found out that they had left because it was so dangerous. They couldn't take me with them. I mean they would have captured them and put them in political prison and forgotten about them forever. There was just it was unheard of to escape during that time. Very few people escaped my dad had a job at a ship, so he worked on ships where he traveled to like africa and down the mediterranean, so he saw different countries. He saw he saw a glimpse that most did not so that gave him the idea of how to escape because he came in with the mission to leave and move to america. One day he literally came in with that mission. He was a system buster in the system. The communist system couldn't keep him, and so my mom had faith. They had faith even with no religion, they had faith and they escaped- and I remember during that time my grandma was married to a westerner, a czech slovakian man, so she was able to travel to the western world western world. She was able to travel to austria and different places like that, and so she was able to come and visit me, but they wouldn't really let her any anymore. Once my parents escaped my grandma couldn't come visit me, and I remember government agents coming and patting me on the head, when I was in daycare to make sure that the gov that my parents didn't find a way to smuggle me that my grandma didn't come and take me on the train and leave with me to austria like they kept her um. They wouldn't let her leave bulgaria until the government made sure I was still in daycare. That was one of the last times she visited me um, so they wouldn't let her leave until they made sure that I was in school and then they called the station said: okay, she's, okay, to leave so these kind of tactics they had our phones, tapped anytime. My parents would call they found out where my parents are, they would tell them that they're, never gonna see their daughter again that they're traitors to the country. I mean just some of the worst things that you can possibly say to someone um and, and my parents went through a lot and and they they escaped because they it was worth it for them. They wanted a better life for themselves, and eventually me I mean they didn't know. If they were going to see me again, my grandma fought for me. She moved to austria and was able to go to the the embassy there and they fought for me. My parents had no rights, they were immigrants and refugees, but my grandma had rights, and she fought with me for me and eventually, two years later they were able to. They fought for me so much that the communist government was not allowed to hold me anymore. They had to give me a passport and they waited until my parents. Passport was about to expire, so my parents, they knew all the information. They knew that my parents had to leave austria to go to canada and they waited until the day they left for canada to release me. So I can be away from my parents even longer several months more like they. They did those things on purpose, my grandma. When she fought for me, they told her that only the communists will keep a child away from her parents and that's the way they do it um. So, finally, they were able to release me. I was reunited with my grandma, but that I thought I was gonna be reunited with my parents. I forgot what they look like. I forgot who they were. I forgot their voices um two years without them, so I turned six in austria and had an amazing time with my grandma there and then um. Several months later, I finally was reunited with my parents. I flew on a plane by myself from austria to canada and that's where my parents were- and I was finally reunited and all of that all of that was worth it to come to this country. We are now in america and my dad was able to build a life, the american dream for us. I have two siblings now and um. We grew up here. I grew up in canada and I from the age of 13 have lived here in the united states and he built one of the largest companies a plumbing company, and it was you know he had offices from california to florida and he built that american dream for us. He knew he wanted freedom, he knew he wanted to live in a country where you can build and create the life of your dreams and um. That's my story. I I grew up here. I never thought I would be so proud to be american. I never really looked at all this, the the things that happened and put them all together. Until now. I came here thinking wow. I thought this would be freedom, but it never really felt too free. It felt very corrupted in the government sections. You know, I didn't care much about government. I didn't care much about politics, none of that stuff never really looked into it and it just felt it still felt communist. It still felt like it was controlled and then it wasn't until you know, uh, hillary and and trump were running, and I thought that night I went to bed thinking, there's no way trump would win. He's an independent he's he's not a part of the system, hillary's a shoe-in, but it's so corrupted. It's so planned beforehand that no one has a chance if they're not in it like she has been in it and I secretly wanted trump to win, but I still didn't believe in politics enough to even um a vote. I I recently became registered to vote for the first time this year, I'm going to vote for trump, of course um. But I can't say I was a walk away because I was never a walk. I was never a democrat. I was never anything. I didn't care about any of it that morning, when I woke up, I went to bed thinking. There is no way trump will win. I woke up thinking wow. We literally just jumped into a new paradigm what a shift in consciousness like we shift timelines. It felt so surreal that trump even got in and I started paying attention from that moment on. I started paying attention what is going on. I knew the wikileaks I I knew all the stuff, I'm intuitive enough to know about everything and where to look for information, so I knew what was going on with all of it. I had just, and then you know when, when the information started coming out and when trump started talking about the stuff that we all knew but was hidden for so long, I started paying attention and I've never been more involved or more um. I just learned about politics like like it's my job like every day, I'm doing homework politics marxism. I mean learning about what what's? What is this ideology that has taken over the world right, um, this communism, marxism, socialism? Whatever you want to call it? It's the same and people have died to escape it. We are here everyone, that's here in this great country. They have escaped that ideology, we're all system busters we're all. You know we're like the rebels, and we all made it here and our our ancestors fought so hard to get here. Don't ever forget that we don't even know the freedom that we have until we've experienced life in those countries, and you will fight to the death to get this freedom and people don't understand that here nobody gets it. The younger generations, don't get it. My generation doesn't get it. You know it's, but the plan is amazing. I mean they have done a good job of brainwashing people. The news and everything is propaganda. It's the same tech tactics, the same same same same and um people from about 20 years ago, have started hating, america and and switching and and now being used to bring in those same ideologies they're being tricked, and we have to open our eyes and see it for what it is. It's important that trump wins and I'm really proud and excited to go and vote for the first time and that's my story and um love. You all bye."
48,4399xLDEYnA,all right people this is my hashtag walkaway video and I have never before bought into any of the hashtag movement because it seemed to me like any time a hashtag campaign was launched it was because it was some entitled Millennials stomping their feet because they didn't get their way but I figured the hashtag walkaway movement was something that was a little different so here's my version of my walkaway moment now I've been raised in a credit because I came from a poor white working-class family all my life I had been taught that it was a democratic party that represented poor America it was a represent Democratic Party that represented black America it was the Democrats that had secured equal rights for black Americans and it was the Democratic Party that maintained those rights to secure that they still had them for black Americans I had been raised to believe that the Democratic Party is the party event protected was the big brother of small business and the Democratic Party it was was for the working class and I had also been taught to believe that it was those damned Oh Republicans that had been bought out by every multimillion-dollar corporation in America it was those damned Oh Republicans that sold out to Big Pharma and let stuff on the shelves that shouldn't be on there and Americans were taking pills that they shouldn't be taken and everything Republicans were bad Democrats were good and my walk away moment came and everything that was running up to the 2016 presidential election because prior to that I had never really been heavily involved in politics and the reason was because I was busy with my American life I had a full-time job kids law needed to be mowed London needed to be done somebody had a dentist appointment you know all that stuff that comes with being American and although I wasn't heavily involved in politics by the time Barack Obama left office I had an absolute hatred for socialism liberalism and the progressive movement and those are words that I learned under the Obama era because I never heard those words before I wasn't familiar with them and the reason I hated it so intensely the reason I hate grew to hate socialism and liberalism so intently is because for eight years Barack Obama dictated to me through executive order because he decided to abuse the power that he'd been given to write all these executive orders to single-handedly transform the United States of America into this utopia that he'd been taught all the way back in college and I had to stand there by things like under the Obama era it became politically correct for anybody to identify as any gender they want to and therefore had the right to use the restroom that they wanted to now I live in a flyover State and people run here know that grown-ass men have no business being in the same restroom as women and children or that teenage boys have no business being in the same locker room as teenage girls but in the Obama era that was okay and Obama dictated to me things like you and you and you and you are gonna get a free cellphone and you're gonna help pay for it and then Obama and his administration decided that they the federal government needed to sew up the healthcare industry because they could do far managed better at managing it than these private sector capitalists and if your monthly premiums health insurance premiums jump from 600 months to 900 a month sorry about your luck and then I had to stand there I'm doing the Obama era why this group called black lives matter sprung up and I would stand there and watch in horror for multiple YouTube videos because I quit relying on mainstream media but during the presidential election and people that lived in these cities where black lives matter bro win and these cities would be destroyed with riots and looting and fires and busted glass and bus stops that have been torn to smithereens and small businesses that have been taken out and by the time this group rolled out if they admitted they believe the local taxpayer footing the bill for several million dollars with the damage and the attitude was sorry about your luck and then Barack Obama decides it'd be a great idea to invite the leaders to this group to the White House to give him a special pat on the back anta boy you know what I'm saying and it's like but I didn't see if you were here view reaching out to these communities that they just destroyed under Barack Obama era it became politically furet correct for police officers just to have somebody walk up to him and sugar in the head kill him sube because they wore uniform and I could go on and on and on but y'all are getting the gist of this and so by the time Barack Obama left office although I didn't know much about politics I knew that I absolutely hated socialism liberalism and the progressive movement so it was really curious to see what the United States of America was going to produce in a way of candidates because we had by that point had become this great divided you had the west coast and the East Coast that were like-minded and then you had middle America which was I'm where I'm from and absolutely nothing in common with these coastal states so we get Hillary Clinton and we get Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton decides to pick right up where Barack Obama had left off it was like there was nothing about middle America or middle America values or medical American jobs that was on her radar it's like oh that went over her head and I noticed that every time Hillary Clinton gave a speech her message was exactly the same which was all you female voters you're oppressed and you just don't know it while you black voters you're pressed to and you just don't know it and all you Latino voters well you're part of the downtrodden and the underrepresented and you're your press too if y'all just vote for me I'll fix all your problems I didn't buy that because I didn't feel oppressed there's a female I didn't feel oppressed I never felt the need to walk around the pink hat on my head that represented my genitalia you know what I'm saying so she had all these marches and Hillary supporting all these marches and Hillary telling all these feminists to go get them I never connected with that I never felt oppressed and then you had Donald Trump and I'm gonna be honest with y'all when Donald Trump first announced his he was gonna run for president my immediate go-to thought was the hills is billionaire from New York City doing what what does he have in common with his average Joe Americans I know what this is he's just bored and this is a case of hold my beer and watch this I knew what that meant so when I started watching Donald Trump speeches at Israelis I quickly learned that there was no entertainment value actually he was speaking my language when Donald Trump would stand up and say oh you displaced oil field workers I got something for you all you displace a factory workers I got something for you too because I'm from Oklahoma and our primary commerce is oil in agriculture and so he was talking to us he was talking our language and at the same exact time Donald Trump has given these speeches you have executives and CEOs from Silicon Valley in Seattle Washington New York City put out these tweets and upend these articles that say they have absolutely no they could care less about what a middle America's financial plight is because it's our own fault that we're poor because we were too dumb to move with the times which was with technology we were so uneducated and backwoods that we were so busy cleaning to our dirty greasy manufacturing jobs that we let the times pass us by so we've got exactly what we deserved and every time I would read one of these treats of these articles from these execs from Silicon Valley or New York City or Seattle I would think to myself but you're sit in your mansion soaking up the air-conditioning that was built in middle America by a blue-collar worker your car is being worked on by somebody that is a blue-collar worker your washer your dryer the refrigerator was built in middle America by a blue-collar worker but yet you look down your nose at us and you think we're absolutely Olson to you I represent middle America I get up every day and go to work I am the working class so why is it Donald Trump decided to come to Oklahoma when nobody else wanted to why are we if this forgotten state and when he did come down to Oklahoma Donald Trump looked out in the crowd and he said hey Oklahoma I haven't forgotten about you and Missouri and Arkansas and Kansas and all the other Midwestern states I hadn't forgot about you and if you work with me I got something for you and that's a job and that's a job it's gonna pay well that's gonna job that's gonna allow you to afford that house that you've been looking at on realtor.com for last six months and I'm gonna tell you that's exactly why Oklahoma is a red state and that's exactly how he was able to flip all these other states because he was speaking a language that we could relate to no man in this video on a sidenote and this video is for all of you liberal bully hateful people because I've seen you on YouTube as well I've seen you with your masks I've seen you walk up to people in restaurants and snatch hats off their heads I've seen you walk up to people in restaurants and intimidate them and harass them to the point that they left your noticed okay middle America sees what you're doing too so my advice to you is to keep that nonsense contained to those democratically ran cities because here in Oklahoma and even Texas our lawmakers have said we have the right to defend ourselves our lawmakers said we can conceal and carry a firearm we could even openly carry a firearm and so in Oklahoma and Texas yet be really careful about rolling up some somebody get in their face acting aggressive challenging them because you love will get you ass shot so as you do all this this bullying hateful rhetoric in Seattle in Portland in Los Angeles in New York City in Chicago I suggest you keep it there did you try to roll that [ __ ] out here you're probably gonna get shot so that was my walkaway moment I hope you enjoyed it have a good day bye all right people this is my hashtag walkaway video and I have never before bought into any of the hashtag movement because it seemed to me like any time a hashtag campaign was launched it was because it was some entitled Millennials stomping

seemed to me like any time a hashtag campaign was launched. It was because it was some entitled Millennials stomping their feet because they didn't get their way, but I figured the hashtag. Walkaway movement was something that was a little different. So here's my version of my walkaway moment now I've been raised in a credit because I came from a poor white working-class family.

The reason I hate grew to hate socialism and liberalism. So intently is because for eight years, Barack Obama dictated to me through executive order, because he decided to abuse the power that he'd been given to write. All these executive orders to single-handedly transform the United States of America into this utopia that he'd been taught all the way back in college and I had to stand there by things like under the Obama era.

And if your monthly premiums, health insurance premiums jump from 600 months to 900 a month. Sorry about your luck and then I had to stand there I'm doing the Obama era. Why this group called black lives matter, sprung up and I would stand there and watch in horror for multiple YouTube videos, because I quit relying on mainstream media, but during the presidential election and people that lived in these cities where black lives matter, bro win and these cities would be destroyed with riots and looting and fires and busted, glass and bus stops that have been torn to smithereens and small businesses that have been taken out and by the time this group rolled out. If they admitted they believe the local taxpayer footing the bill for several million dollars with the damage. And the attitude was sorry about your luck and then Barack Obama decides it'd, be a great idea to invite the leaders to this group to the White House to give him a special pat on the back anta boy. You know what I'm saying and it's like, but I didn't see. If you were here view reaching out to these communities that they just destroyed under Barack Obama era, it became politically furet correct for police officers just to have somebody walk up to him and sugar in the head, kill him sube, because they wore uniform and I could go on and on and on, but y'all are getting the gist of this, and so by the time Barack Obama left office. Although I didn't know much about politics, I knew that I absolutely hated socialism, liberalism and the progressive movement. So it was really curious to see what the United States of America was going to produce in a way of candidates, because we had, by that point, had become this great divided. You had the west coast and the East Coast that were like-minded, and then you had middle America, which was I'm where I'm from and absolutely nothing in common with these coastal states. So we get Hillary Clinton and we get Donald. Trump and Hillary Clinton decides to pick right up where Barack Obama had left off. It was like there was nothing about middle America or middle America values or medical American jobs. That was on her radar. It's like oh, that went over her head and I noticed that every time Hillary Clinton gave a speech. Her message was exactly the same, which was all you female voters, you're oppressed and you just don't know it. While you black voters, you're pressed to- and you just don't know it and all you Latino voters well you're part of the downtrodden and the underrepresented and you're your press too. If y'all just vote for me, I'll fix all your problems, I didn't buy that because I didn't feel oppressed. There's a female I didn't feel oppressed. I, never felt the need to walk around the pink hat on my head that represented my genitalia. You know what I'm saying so she had all these marches and Hillary supporting all these marches and Hillary, telling all these feminists to go, get them I, never connected with that I never felt oppressed, and then you had Donald Trump and I'm gonna be honest with y'all, when Donald Trump first announced his, he was gonna run for president. My immediate go-to thought was: the hills is billionaire from New York City doing what? What does he have in common with his average Joe Americans I know what this is he's just bored, and this is a case of hold my beer and watch. This I knew what that meant. So, when I started, watching Donald Trump speeches at Israelis I quickly learned that there was no entertainment value. Actually, he was speaking my language when Donald Trump would stand up and say: oh you displaced oil field. Workers I got something for you all. You displace a factory workers I got something for you too, because I'm from Oklahoma and our primary commerce is oil in agriculture, and so he was talking to us. He was talking our language and, at the same exact time Donald Trump has given these speeches. You have executives and CEOs from Silicon Valley in Seattle, Washington New, York City put out these tweets and upend these articles. That say they have absolutely no. They could care less about what a middle America's financial plight is, because it's our own fault that we're poor, because we were too dumb to move with the times, which was with technology. We were so uneducated and backwoods that we were so busy cleaning to our dirty greasy manufacturing jobs that we let the times pass us by. So we've got exactly what we deserved and every time I would read. One of these treats of these articles from these execs from Silicon, Valley or New, York, City or Seattle I would think to myself, but you're sit in your mansion soaking up the air-conditioning that was built in middle America by a blue-collar worker. Your car is being worked on by somebody that is a blue-collar worker. Your washer, your dryer, the refrigerator, was built in middle America by a blue-collar worker. But yet you look down your nose at us and you think we're absolutely Olson to you. I represent middle America I, get up every day and go to work. I am the working class, so why is it Donald Trump decided to come to Oklahoma when nobody else wanted to? Why are we if this forgotten state and when he did come down to Oklahoma Donald Trump, looked out in the crowd and he said: hey Oklahoma I haven't forgotten about you and Missouri, and Arkansas and Kansas, and all the other Midwestern states. I hadn't forgot about you and if you work with me, I got something for you and that's a job and that's a job. It's gonna pay! Well, that's gonna job! That's gonna! Allow you to afford that house that you've been looking at on realtor.com for last six months and I'm gonna tell you that's exactly why Oklahoma is a red state and that's exactly how he was able to flip all these other states, because he was speaking a language that we could relate to no man in this video on a sidenote, and this video is for all of you, liberal, bully hateful people, because I've seen you on YouTube as well. I've seen you with your masks, I've seen you walk up to people in restaurants and snatch hats off their heads. I've seen you walk up to people in restaurants and intimidate them and harass them to the point that they left your noticed. Okay, middle America sees what you're doing too. So my advice to you is to keep that nonsense contained to those democratically ran cities, because here in Oklahoma and even Texas, our lawmakers have said we have the right to defend ourselves. Our lawmakers said we can conceal and carry a firearm. We could even openly carry a firearm, and so in Oklahoma and Texas, yet be really careful about rolling up some somebody get in their face. Acting aggressive, challenging them because you love will get you ass shot. So as you do all this, this bullying hateful rhetoric in Seattle in Portland in Los Angeles in New, York City in Chicago I, suggest you keep it there. Did you try to roll that [ __ ] out here? You're, probably gonna get shot, so that was my walkaway moment. I hope you enjoyed. It have a good day, bye, all right people. This is my hashtag walkaway video and I have never before bought into any of the hashtag movement, because it seemed to me like any time a hashtag campaign was launched. It was because it was some entitled Millennials stomping their feet because they didn't get their way, but I figured the hashtag. Walkaway movement was something that was a little different, so here's my version of my walkaway moment now I've been raised in a credit because I came from a poor white working-class family. All my life I had been taught that it was a democratic party that represented poor America. It was a represent Democratic Party that represented black America. It was the Democrats that had secured equal rights for black Americans and it was the Democratic Party that maintained those rights to secure that they still had them for black Americans I had been raised to believe that the Democratic Party is the party event protected was the big brother of small business and the Democratic Party it was was for the working class and I had also been taught to believe that it was those damned Oh Republicans that had been bought out by every multimillion-dollar corporation in America. It was those damned Oh, Republicans that sold out to Big Pharma and let stuff on the shelves that shouldn't be on there and Americans were taking pills that they shouldn't be taken and everything Republicans were bad. Democrats were good and my walk away moment came and everything that was running up to the 2016 presidential election, because, prior to that I had never really been heavily involved in politics, and the reason was because I was busy with my American life I had a full-time job, kids law needed to be mowed London needed to be done. Somebody had a dentist appointment. You know all that stuff that comes with being American and although I wasn't heavily involved in politics by the time Barack Obama left office, I had an absolute hatred for socialism, liberalism and the progressive movement, and those are words that I learned under the Obama era, because I never heard those words before I wasn't familiar with them and the reason I hated it so intensely. The reason I hate grew to hate socialism and liberalism. So intently is because for eight years, Barack Obama dictated to me through executive order, because he decided to abuse the power that he'd been given to write. All these executive orders to single-handedly transform the United States of America into this utopia that he'd been taught all the way back in college and I had to stand there by things like under the Obama era. It became politically correct for anybody to identify as any gender they want to and therefore had the right to use the restroom that they wanted to now. I live in a flyover, State and people run here, know that grown-ass men have no business being in the same restroom as women and children, or that teenage boys have no business being in the same locker room as teenage girls. But in the Obama era that was okay and Obama dictated to me. Things like you and you and you and you are gonna, get a free, cellphone and you're gonna help pay for it and then Obama and his administration decided that they, the federal government, needed to sew up the healthcare industry because they could do far managed better at managing it than these private sector capitalists. And if your monthly premiums, health insurance premiums jump from 600 months to 900 a month. Sorry about your luck and then I had to stand there I'm doing the Obama era. Why this group called black lives matter, sprung up and I would stand there and watch in horror for multiple YouTube videos, because I quit relying on mainstream media, but during the presidential election and people that lived in these cities where black lives matter, bro win and these cities would be destroyed with riots and looting and fires and busted, glass and bus stops that have been torn to smithereens and small businesses that have been taken out and by the time this group rolled out. If they admitted they believe the local taxpayer footing the bill for several million dollars with the damage. And the attitude was sorry about your luck and then Barack Obama decides it'd, be a great idea to invite the leaders to this group to the White House to give him a special pat on the back anta boy. You know what I'm saying and it's like, but I didn't see. If you were here view reaching out to these communities that they just destroyed under Barack Obama era, it became politically furet correct for police officers just to have somebody walk up to him and sugar in the head, kill him sube, because they wore uniform and I could go on and on and on, but y'all are getting the gist of this, and so by the time Barack Obama left office.

50,4NOjiyGMlok,hey there hi walk away people my name is Harold and this is my walk away movement I made one moves back in August of 2018 but I was never really comfortable with it and I never posted it but I figured that was a good time I will be attending the events in New York City the walk away events in New York City next week so I decided this is as good a time as any to get it out there by the way forgive the sunglasses I suffer from photo media which is like sensitivity so I have to wear them and I just like the Hat anyway I started in politics when I was about 15 years old when my cousin David took me to a Vietnam War protests he was you know I was 15 and he was like you know you're gonna be 18 soon and they're gonna want to draft you if this war doesn't end and I was like I don't want to go kill people so I became an anti-war activist you know as much as a 15 year old can do and you know but I was always a democratic always considered myself a Democrat always considered myself somewhat progressive but I was never an ideologue I didn't hate the other side I didn't consider one perfect and one evil or any of that crap so I just you know okay I was a Democrat but the Democrat Party he never really really really felt right there was something wrong with the whole picture I saw the education system in New York City and the and the segregation and you know all this kind of stuff that just bothered me it's like if the Democrat Party so great why are the inner city so crap it didn't make any sense to me so anyway I just went along with it because you know basically I was used to it that's what I knew but you know it really wasn't like I said an ideal I wasn't crazy about it but then came 2016 and what I saw there was just so ridiculous I couldn't make heads or tails of it it just seemed that the election of Donald Trump or the eveny before the election the campaign's was just so outrageous and ridiculous I'm in New Yorker I know Donald Trump I mean he's been in the news here for 20 years no one ever called him a racist or misogynist or a bigot or any of those things but now all of a sudden he became off overnight bump I mean get pictures with him with the n-double-a-cp without Sharpton like hanging out he got an award now all of a sudden he's a racist crazy man give me a break okay you lost that's it you lost get over it but they couldn't and what I saw coming out of sin sin was the vitriol and the hatred of not only Donald Trump but anybody that supported him all of a sudden half this country became bigoted racist crazy rural I low IQ uneducated deplorable morons into the left sides it just got ridiculous and I just I couldn't make heads or tails of it I couldn't understand it and then I realized that they didn't care about this country they cared that they lost it bothered them so much that Hillary Clinton by the way I hate okay I think she's a horror show for I think that the Democrats made a huge mirror I'm not a Bernie bro but I would have preferred Barney anytime over Hillary I mean it's not even close so you know that really bothered me when they messed over Bernie and a you know they gave Hillary on a silver platter and when she lost the world went nuts and I couldn't deal with it and I said you know what I've had enough of this and why Brandon and Strava said you know what was going on here it didn't make any sense so now I am a full-fledged deplorable trump card I like the guy I'm glad that he's standing up to all the craziness and the insanity out there you know it just makes no sense that it was like this at all so I'm not making a whole lot of sense but here I am and you know I just hope this country gets its act together and that the walk away movement makes something I think it's going to do a lot of damage to Democrats I think that they're there they're going so far to the regressive left with the identity politics and all that stuff that just makes no sense to me so that's my story it's not much of a story it's just a story but you know I hope to make more videos I hope to be more involved if I can considering the conservative censorship that's going on on social media and all over the place but I think that's going to get settled too but that's about it and I love you all and I thank you all for listening and we'll see what happens have a great day [Music] you hey there hi walk away people my name is Harold and this is my walk away movement I made one moves back in August of 2018 but I was never really comfortable with it and I never posted it but I figured that was a good time I will be attending the events in New York City the walk away events in New York City next week so I decided this is as good a time as any to get it out there by the way forgive

me to a Vietnam War protests he was you know I was 15 and he was like you know you're gonna be 18 soon and they're gonna want to draft you if this war doesn't end and I was like I don't want to go kill people so I became an anti-war activist you know as much as a 15 year old can do and you know but I was always a democratic always considered myself a Democrat always considered myself somewhat progressive but I was never an ideologue I didn't hate the other side I didn't consider one perfect and one evil or any of that crap so I just you know okay I was a Democrat but the Democrat Party he never really really really felt right there was something wrong with the whole picture I saw the education system in New York City and the and the segregation and you know all this kind of stuff that just bothered me it's like if the Democrat Party so great why are the inner city so crap it didn't make any sense to me so anyway I just went along with it because you know basically I was used to it that's what I knew but you know it really wasn't like I said an ideal I wasn't crazy about it but then came 2016 and what I saw there was just so ridiculous I couldn't make heads or tails of it it just seemed that the election of Donald Trump or the eveny before the election the campaign's was just so outrageous and ridiculous I'm in New Yorker I know Donald Trump I mean he's been in the news here for 20 years no one ever called him a racist or misogynist or a bigot or any of those things but now all of a sudden he became off overnight bump I mean get pictures with him with the n-double-a-cp without Sharpton like hanging out he got an award now all of a sudden he's a racist crazy man give me a break okay you lost that's it you lost get over it but they couldn't and what I saw coming out of sin sin was the vitriol and the hatred of not only Donald Trump but anybody that supported him all of a sudden half this country became bigoted racist crazy rural I low IQ uneducated deplorable morons into the left sides it just got ridiculous and I just I couldn't make heads or tails of it I couldn't understand it and then I realized that they didn't care about this country they cared that they lost it bothered them so much that Hillary Clinton by the way I hate okay I think she's a horror show for I think that the Democrats made a huge mirror I'm not a Bernie bro but I would have preferred Barney anytime over Hillary I mean it's not even close so you know that really bothered me when they messed over Bernie and a you know they gave Hillary on a silver platter and when she lost the world went nuts and I couldn't deal with it and I said you know what I've had enough of this and why Brandon and Strava said you know what was going on here it didn't make any sense so now I am a full-fledged deplorable trump card I like the guy I'm glad that he's standing up to all the craziness and the insanity out there you know it just makes no sense that it was like this at all so I'm not making a whole lot of sense but here I am and you know I just hope this country gets its act together and that the walk away movement makes something I think it's going to do a lot of damage to Democrats I think that they're there they're going so far to the regressive left with the identity politics and all that stuff that just makes no sense to me so that's my story it's not much of a story it's just a story but you know I hope to make more videos I hope to be more involved if I can considering the conservative censorship that's going on on social media and all over the place but I think that's going to get settled too but that's about it and I love you all and I thank you all for listening and we'll see what happens have a great day [Music] you,"Hey there hi walk away people,

51,4P1B89l1nEY,hi you guys uh i wanted to share my walk away story with you we're about 12 days to the election and everything is really coming to a head and tonight's the debate with potus and biden so i'm looking forward to that but um tensions are high and and i think there's um a lot of duality happening between our our parties good and evil everything like that and so my walk away story began about a year and a half ago when i was fighting some pretty draconian vaccine mandate bills here in colorado where they're trying to essentially whittle away our rights and and force our kids to have the full set of vaccinations in order to attend school and i know that's a very tumultuous subject and that's not the point right now what i learned through going through that process is seeing how the democratic legislators both in the house and senate voted party line and they heard i mean thousands of testimonies of parents with their vaccine damaged children right there beside them or pictures of their dead children and they um their testimonies were lost on deaf ears and so those bills passed with flying colors it was pretty incredible it really opened my eyes and i i realized that our legislators are bought and paid for by pharma and uh the republican um legislation was fabulous and fought for us and were brilliant and strong and and that's what moved me toward toward walking away from the democratic party and since everything has gone down with these riots and with the covet situation i've i have seen that this this democratic party was is not my democratic party i don't feel any association with them at this point and the shenanigans they've pulled are disgusting and i'm i'm done so president trump has my full support i love that man i send him all my strength and energy he is fighting so hard for us and it's time we fight back for him and uh get in there and vote give potus your your vote he deserves it he's there for us he's a patriot and he sees the light and he wants to guide us there in so many ways so get out there and vote enjoy the debate tonight i love you all bye you,"Hi you guys uh. I wanted to share my walk away story with you, we're about 12 days to the election, and everything is really coming to a head and tonight's, the debate with potus and biden. So I'm looking forward to that. But um tensions are high and- and I think, there's um a lot of duality happening between our our parties, good and evil. Everything like that, and so my walk away story began about a year and a half ago when I was fighting some pretty draconian vaccine mandate bills here in colorado, where they're trying to essentially whittle away our rights and and force our kids to have the full set of vaccinations in order to attend school- and I know that's a very tumultuous subject and that's not the point right now. What I learned through going through that process is seeing how the democratic legislators, both in the house and senate, voted party line, and they heard I mean thousands of testimonies of parents with their vaccine, damaged children right there beside them or pictures of their dead children and they um their testimonies were lost on deaf ears and so those bills passed with flying colors. It was pretty incredible. It really opened my eyes and I I realized that our legislators are bought and paid for by pharma and uh. The republican um legislation was fabulous and fought for us and were brilliant and strong, and and that's what moved me toward toward walking away from the democratic party, and since everything has gone down with these riots and with the covet situation I've. I have seen that this this democratic party was is not my democratic party. I don't feel any association with them at this point and the shenanigans they've pulled are disgusting and I'm I'm done so. President trump has my full support. I love that man. I send him all my strength and energy. He is fighting so hard for us and it's time we fight back for him and uh get in there and vote give potus your your vote. He deserves it he's there for us, he's a patriot and he sees the light and he wants to guide us there in so many ways so get out there and vote enjoy the debate tonight. I love you all bye. You."
52,4QL5gaTNAsU,i guess this is my uh walk away testimony kind of nervous um brandon straka gave me a lot of inspiration as a gay male actually gay married male um ever since facebook um pretty much started i felt as if like as a registered democrat but technically this is actually my first year ever voting which is weird i know but i got my driver's license back in 2013 and i put on my driver's democrat i put democrat just because uh i was told well there's so many other parties but majority of it is either red or blue red being republican blue being democrat well i was always told that the democrat party was accepting of the gay people funny thing is republicans are too um i started learning stuff just as social media gave on i really never cared about politics i really gave two craps about it i mean i feel like literally like if i would have paid attention a little bit more back when trump and hillary were running for president i probably would have voted for hillary at the time just because i was told oh well she likes gay people she's for the gays so then i started noticing stuff literally like i remember justin obama's presidency i remember him saying an interview that marriage between man and woman and i thought interesting be i didn't mean it was legalized in his year so i thought well maybe i maybe i still am a democrat and then so i don't know just it seems like the left has brainwashed a lot of us to kind of think a certain way that i mean in case you all didn't know this but there's actually a trump derangement syndrome he actually has a syndrome that's for people that just absolutely hate him and our anti-trump and all this stuff which is weird very weird um i don't know what i really really what else to say in this uh i guess basically during the shutdown what kind of woke me up um i'm a hairdresser in the state of kentucky so when march came around we were told we had to lock our doors so being cooped up in the house for basically two and a half three months whatever time period it was it felt like a freaking century um stuff just started not to add up i started seeing things like on facebook that would be censored or removed or they'd be you'd see it for a second then it'd be gone whatever and um that had me questioning stuff like it's like me walking outside and saying the sky is yellow and da da da and it's always yellow it's never purple it's never blue but that doesn't get censored that doesn't get removed granted i'm sure there's probably some reason why that that wouldn't get censored and that's probably a stupid example of it but i was seeing doctors come forward doctors that like you would just kind of look into and be like oh fact checkers would say well they're not real doctors and so to start digging i was like actually these are real doctors if this is about the health of the country the world why aren't we listening to these doctors i remember a video of one doctor that basically he had his whole stuff removed and people were attacking him because he said i think these ventilators aren't helping i think it's the wrong kind of treatment why were dr putars a famous doctor in i believe it's either washington or california but anyways though why were his videos being taken off or cut in half i just started like questioning so many things just so what was going on like in today's world like some of this stuff doesn't make sense we're told to wear a mask and we're told oh no you don't have to wear a mask but quarantine if you think you have symptoms and it's just stuff wasn't adding up it almost made me feel like literally that a lot of this was conspiracy related or maybe this was all bogus yeah we would see cases rise and stuff like that but it was as we saw cases rise we saw the fatality rate drop tremendously i don't know i just something seems fishy after watching brandon's testimony i kind of like looking into stuff and i was like i actually knew about the debunking of the president making fun of the guy with it was making fun of the guy that was special needs related and i was like why does the media hate him so much because i do remember like my family talking about the president of the united states trump that i mean he was friends with bigwigs that were gay black women he wasn't called a homophobe a racist or anything like that then until he ran for president but i just kind of thought about things and i was just kind of like this guy may not be so bad after all um i feel like i've just kind of babbled in this testimony but my name is christopher fanon and i was a registered democrat and now i am walking away i will not be the victim of the democratic party i will not be the victim period and another thing too i can't be brainwashed and also when you cut out a man's tongue you're not proving him a liar you're pru you're only proving of what y of what he might say food for thought where we go one we go all i've switched to become a trump supporter in 2020 as a gay married man i hope i give someone else courage to do the same bye,"I guess this is my uh walk away. Testimony kind of nervous, um brandon straka, gave me a lot of inspiration as a gay male, actually gay married male um ever since facebook um pretty much started, I felt as if, like as a registered democrat, but technically this is actually my first year ever voting, which is weird I know, but I got my driver's license back in 2013 and I put on my driver's democrat I put democrat just because uh I was told well there's so many other parties, but majority of it is either red or blue red being republican blue being democrat.

53,4XOyOB_N1z4,good morning Facebook or YouTube or whatever you happen to be watching me from this is Rebecca from Black is the new bread and this is the morning after the midterm elections 2018 and I am filled with mixed emotions this morning because my state of Florida actually held on and did not elect a socialist extremists left-wing crazy you did not we did not elect him and we did elect two wonderful Republicans so I'm very happy about that very unhappy about the results in the house even though we were being told it was going to happen very upset about that because now we're facing two more years of just obstruction obstruction obstruction and we have Nancy Pelosi as the possible speaker that's a nightmare Maxine Waters over the finances of committee that's a nightmare um so but I think this is a time for reflection I think this is a time for us just to figure out what went right what went wrong and those of us who have walked away to just do more research and try to have reasonable conversations and educational times of learning for our friends who are not all that educated when it comes to what exactly is socialism okay what is a democracy what is a republic what are the basic things that make America America and just because you hate Trump you would vote for someone with socialist policies with a socialist policy agenda I mean you we can't let hatred just totally a completely infiltrate our decision-making processes and decide that we're going to vote for someone that is pushing an agenda that is completely my American is ridiculous and uh as we reflect back over the midterms of now we gotta start looking forward so keep walking away keep educating keep repelling um as far as being an african-american and being a Republican is difficult I've been attacked I've been called all kinds of names by family members and it's been kind of difficult but I'm still gonna keep walking away I'm not turning back not going back but what we're gonna see for the next two years in the house is just obstruction obstruction obstruction and bogus hearings like we did with the Cavanaugh hearings that are gonna lead to nothing but it's gonna just encourage their base to just keep voting for people weren't gonna do anything for you this is the first day of the 2020 election cycle let's get it done in 2020 let's stand behind our president let's get it done let's continue to educate other Democrats why they need to walk away and also exit why we need to exit the Democrat plantation and get on the winning train to victory be encouraged guys be encouraged we did have some victories Texas Georgia Florida it's looking good be encouraged today by you,"Good morning, Facebook or YouTube, or whatever you happen to be watching me from this, is Rebecca from Black is the new bread, and this is the morning after the midterm. Elections, 2018 and I am filled with mixed emotions this morning, because my state of Florida actually held on and did not elect a socialist extremists. Left-Wing crazy, you did not. We did not elect him and we did elect two wonderful Republicans, so I'm very happy about that very unhappy about the results in the house, even though we were being told it was going to happen very upset about that, because now we're facing two more years of just obstruction, obstruction obstruction and we have Nancy Pelosi as the possible speaker. That's a nightmare Maxine Waters over the finances of committee. That's a nightmare um! So but I think this is a time for reflection. I think this is a time for us just to figure out what went right. What went wrong and those of us who have walked away to just do more research and try to have reasonable conversations and educational times of learning for our friends who are not all that educated when it comes to what exactly is socialism? Okay? What is a democracy? What is a republic? What are the basic things that make America America and just because you hate Trump, you would vote for someone with socialist policies with a socialist policy agenda. I mean you. We can't let hatred just totally a completely infiltrate our decision-making processes and decide that we're going to vote for someone that is pushing an agenda. That is completely my American is ridiculous and uh as we reflect back over the midterms of now. We gotta start looking forward, so keep walking away. Keep educating, keep repelling um as far as being an african-american and being a Republican is difficult. I've been attacked, I've been called all kinds of names by family members and it's been kind of difficult, but I'm still gonna keep walking away I'm, not turning back, not going back, but what we're gonna see for the next two years in the house is just obstruction, obstruction, obstruction and bogus hearings like we did with the Cavanaugh hearings that are gonna lead to nothing, but it's gonna just encourage their base to just keep voting for people. Weren't gonna do anything for you. This is the first day of the 2020 election cycle. Let's get it done in 2020. Let's stand behind our president. Let's get it done. Let's continue to educate other Democrats, why they need to walk away and also exit. Why we need to exit the Democrat plantation and get on the winning train to victory, be encouraged, guys be encouraged. We did have some victories, Texas, Georgia Florida. It's looking good, be encouraged today by you."
54,4zhiFs4Om8Y,my name is Troy I'm giving this video the walk away video because it's time to tell the truth I'm a Canadian citizen living in America I have my green card and go through the immigration process become US citizen and I was raised on socials behavior and it's actually not good for the country so I've walked away from the Socialist Movement embrace the conservative values I've always been a conservative heart but they didn't really understood how politics work I looked at the Democrats these days they want open borders they want to take away people's guns they want to violate the US Constitution they want to take away the right to free speech you can only have free speech as long as you are in attacking someone who supports President Trump they want to work so that

55,518PseM3uFg,"good evening walk away Canada hi my name is Stephen this is the first time that I'll be posting within this group I'm going to talk a little bit about Who I am and what brought me to this point of joining the walk away excuse me I feel that my message needs to be heard and the reason I do so is because I believe that the majority of us have been lied to we have been lied to believe that the one side looks out for us more than the other and that's something that I fell for for many many years of my adult life I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself I am a matey Canadian which means I'm half native and half European not a happier peon is Ukrainian I am also gay so that right there is what made me liberal I believe that the Liberals were going to save me that they were going to ensure that my rights as a gay male were taken care of and as an interracial male I felt for over identifying myself based on my race and my sexuality and lost truth and lost what it really meant to be a Canadian so now I identify myself as simply first last and foremost a Canadian I am NOT a matey Canadian I am NOT a gay Canadian I'm a Canadian and that's the things that we need to be willing that's that one thing that I feel we need to get back to is having some national pride just simply being proud to be a Canadian because to me that's enough we have been lied for so we've been lied to for so many years and it was it's just assumed that if you are into racial and that you are gay you are liberal and I was one of them I was a far lefted individual who was who were protesting against any conservative movement motion anything then I realized that I was lied to as were many of us well woke me up honestly with the American election at the beginning of it I was a Trump hater and I was a Trudeau supporter I voted for adapt for Trudeau unfortunately but the more and more that I watched Trump and really watched him and did my own research the more and more I realized the Trump was not a racist a bigoted homophobic or transphobic he was just simply an American who was sick and tired of Americans being kicked around he was tired of seeing his people the American people being swallowed up by corruption and that's what we are going through right now here in Canada we are over identifying ourselves with things that in the big scheme of things do not matter because being Canadian is at stake here the attack on our oil industry the UN pact and you know what you'll learn that conservatives aren't anti-immigration we are anti illegal immigration that we are a land of laws and those laws must be followed and if I as a Canadian born citizen sorry my nose is itchy and I'm expected to follow those laws than anyone enter our borders or attempting to come into this country need to do it legally I myself have been labeled a racist homophobe which is kind of funny because as I've explained to you earlier on in the video I am interracial I'm ma T and I'm also gay so I want that to really sink into you when they can live label me a racist homophobe then realistically no one is off-limits the labels when someone disagrees with somebody is another reason that I started opening my eyes watching comments that people would comment on someone who's got more of a conservative viewpoint the type of comments that they would leave the insults the put-downs the threats and the same great type of racist remarks that they're coming down on conservatives supposedly for being I seen more racist comments being posted by left minded liberals than I do by conservatives and I am now proud to announce that I am a conservative and that I will make sure and ensure that our values as Canadians are taken care of across the board my rights as an interracial gay man do not Trump anyone elses rights when my rights as an individual start hindering the rights of my fellow Canadians that's when it's becoming a problem and what's happening is we're silencing people and that is not right we live in a land that is supposed to be free where we pride ourselves in freedom of speech so someone this simply disagrees with something they're entitled to do so without worrying about ridicule put-downs insults threats and yes labeling this is my Canada as it is yours and it is not only my obligation but my honor to take a stand for my nation and for all that call it home and that all who will respect the values that is Canada I came across the walk away movement because of a few friends and you know I honestly feel like I was identifying as a liberal even though I still had part of me that didn't completely believe in the in the Liberal system in a way because I've always questioned things but I simply used to go with the grain I used to follow the pact I used to pride myself on thinking I was a leader when I was a follower but now I am a lion and you will hear me roar I will no longer stay silent and I want no one else to feel they must be silenced because they will be labeled and if they someone does label you let them I have learned to just accept though not everyone is going to agree with what I have to say and I'm okay with respectful debate but you can't expect anyone to listen to you or your argument when you start insulting and putting them down we are naturally defensive beings so as soon as someone starts putting us down insulting us our walls of defense go up then there's no way the person you're talking to is even going to listen to you we tend to lean too much on our emotions and less with logic and that's one thing that kept me lost for so long is because I over identified with my sexuality in my race I felt like any time I would see a story or an article on mainstream media or in the papers and they would make sure that they pointed out that the person was gay or interracial or First Nations or whatever but it angered me they preyed on our emotions and I realize that now they preyed on us and they preyed on our vulnerabilities while I will no longer than do that I am going to awaken more Canadians as time goes by this isn't the end of me and nor is my voice ever going to be silenced the same people another thing is another reason I was pushed away from conservatives was because I was told that they would not accept me I was made to believe that they were homophobic racist and bigoted and I've done a few videos in in other groups as you will full of people from all walks of life have a video out there that's garnered over 20,000 views mainly of which was viewed by conservative minded people or conservatives and you know what not one comment about my homeless abstract homosexuality and not one comment about my race all the comments there were encouraging uplifting and inspiring these were the same type of people that I was taught to fear that I was taught would never accept me and if I was able to I would show you the many the dozens upon dozens of inboxes from conservative Canadians that reached out to me for thanking me for speaking up thanking my bravery telling me that they accept me for who I am which is Stephen being Stephen is enough being Canadian is enough and another thing that liberal minded people push are the Liberal government's push is this victim mentality that we are all victims that I'm a victim because I'm gay because I'm a victim because I'm 80 or that I have First Nation ancestry but I'm not a victim I'm not and neither neither or any of you you can choose to be a warrior or you can choose to be a victim you can choose to be a leader or I can choose to be a victim well I don't want to be a victim I am NOT a victim and I won't let any government institution make me feel that I must be a victim simply because of my sexuality or my race religion or gender we are be we've gotten so lost and things that in the big scheme of things do not matter our nation is crumbling our economy has come to a halt we must rise up Canada come together it realized that we were told a big fat lie about conservatives and about how we should feel about conservatives or people with conservative values or morals or whatever and realize that it's time to put the control back in the hands of the people us Canadians and hold our institutions the people governing us that they work for us and not the other way around I love my Canada and I will never stop standing on guard for thee most of my videos I end by singing the national anthem and I'ma hope you'll you're okay with that and I sing it the way I was taught not the reworded one but the one I was taught so here I go Oh Canada our home and native land true patriot love he know Larson command with glowing hearts we see thee rise the True North strong and free from far and wide o Canada we stand on guard for thee God keep our land glorious and free o Canada we stand on guard for thee o Canada we stand on guard for thee have a good night Canada it is time to walk away take care everyone [Music]","Good evening walk away, Canada hi, my name is Stephen. This is the first time that I'll be posting within this group. I'm, going to talk a little bit about Who I am, and what brought me to this point of joining the walk away. Excuse me, I feel that my message needs to be heard and the reason I do so is because I believe that the majority of us have been lied to. We have been lied to believe that the one side looks out for us more than the other, and that's something that I fell for for many many years of my adult life I'm, going to tell you a little bit about myself. I am a matey Canadian, which means I'm, half native and half European, not a happier peon is Ukrainian. I am also gay so that right, there is. What made me liberal I believe that the Liberals were going to save me that they were going to ensure that my rights as a gay male were taken care of and as an interracial male I felt for over identifying myself, based on my race and my sexuality and lost truth and lost what it really meant to be a Canadian. So now I identify myself as simply. First last and foremost, a Canadian I am NOT a matey Canadian I am NOT a gay Canadian I'm a Canadian, and that's the things that we need to be willing. That's that one thing that I feel we need to get back to is having some national pride just simply being proud to be a Canadian. Because to me that's enough. We have been lied for so we've been lied to for so many years, and it was it's just assumed that if you are into racial and that you are gay, you are liberal and I was one of them. I was a far lefted individual who was who were protesting against any conservative movement motion. Anything then I realized that I was lied to, as were many of us. Well woke me up honestly with the American election at the beginning of it, I was a Trump hater and I was a Trudeau supporter, I voted for adapt for Trudeau, unfortunately, but the more and more that I watched, Trump and really watched him and did my own research, the more and more I realized the Trump was not a racist, a bigoted, homophobic or transphobic. He was just simply an American who was sick and tired of Americans being kicked around. He was tired of seeing his people, the American people being swallowed up by corruption and that's what we are going through right now here in Canada, we are over identifying ourselves with things that, in the big scheme of things, do not matter because being Canadian is at stake here. The attack on our oil industry, the UN pact, and you know what you'll learn that conservatives aren't anti-immigration. We are anti illegal immigration that we are a land of laws and those laws must be followed and, if I as a Canadian born citizen, sorry, my nose is itchy and I'm expected to follow those laws than anyone enter our borders or attempting to come into this country need to do it legally. I myself have been labeled a racist homophobe, which is kind of funny because, as I've explained to you earlier on in the video I am interracial I'm, ma, T and I'm. Also gay so I want that to really sink into you. When they can live label me a racist homophobe, then realistically, no one is off-limits. The labels, when someone disagrees with somebody is another reason that I started opening my eyes watching comments. That people would comment on someone who's got more of a conservative viewpoint, the type of comments that they would leave the insults, the put-downs, the threats and the same great type of racist remarks that they're coming down on conservatives, supposedly for being I. Seen more racist comments being posted by left minded liberals than I do by conservatives and I am now proud to announce that I am a conservative and that I will make sure and ensure that our values as Canadians are taken care of across the board. My rights as an interracial gay man do not Trump anyone. Elses rights when my rights as an individual start hindering the rights of my fellow Canadians. That's when it's becoming a problem and what's happening is we're silencing people, and that is not right. We live in a land that is supposed to be free where we pride ourselves in freedom of speech. So someone this simply disagrees with something they're entitled to do so without worrying about ridicule, put-downs, insults, threats and yes, labeling. This is my Canada as it is yours, and it is not only my obligation but my honor to take a stand for my nation and for all that call it home and that all who will respect the values that is Canada I came across the walk away movement because of a few friends- and you know I honestly feel like I- was identifying as a liberal, even though I still had part of me that didn't completely believe in the in the Liberal system, in a way because I've always questioned things but I simply used to go with the grain I used to follow the pact. I used to pride myself on thinking. I was a leader when I was a follower, but now I am a lion, and you will hear me: roar I will no longer stay. Silent and I want no one else to feel they must be silenced because they will be labeled, and if they someone does label you let them I have learned to just accept, though not everyone is going to agree with what I have to say and I'm, okay with respectful debate. But you can't expect anyone to listen to you or your argument when you start insulting and putting them down, we are naturally defensive beings. So, as soon as someone starts putting us down insulting us, our walls of defense go up. Then there's no way the person you're talking to is even going to listen to you. We tend to lean too much on our emotions and less with logic, and that's one thing that kept me lost for so long is because I over identified with my sexuality in my race, I felt like any time. I would see a story or an article on mainstream media or in the papers, and they would make sure that they pointed out that the person was gay or interracial or First, Nations or whatever, but it angered me they preyed on our emotions and I realize that now they preyed on us and they preyed on our vulnerabilities, while I will no longer than do that. I am going to awaken more Canadians as time goes by. This isn't the end of me, and nor is my voice ever going to be silenced the same people. Another thing is another reason: I was pushed away from. Conservatives was because I was told that they would not accept me. I was made to believe that they were homophobic, racist and bigoted, and I've done a few videos in in other groups, as you will full of people from all walks of life have a video out there. That's garnered over 20,000 views, mainly of which was viewed by conservative minded people or conservatives, and you know what not one comment about my homeless, abstract homosexuality and not one comment about my race. All the comments there were encouraging, uplifting and inspiring. These were the same type of people. That I was taught to fear. That I was taught, would never accept me and if I was able to I would show you the many, the dozens upon dozens of inboxes from conservative Canadians that reached out to me for thanking me for speaking up thanking my bravery, telling me that they accept me for who I am, which is Stephen being Stephen is enough. Being Canadian is enough and another thing that liberal minded people push are the Liberal government's push? Is this victim mentality that we are all victims that I'm a victim because I'm gay, because I'm a victim because I'm 80 or that I have First Nation ancestry, but I'm? Not a victim I'm, not, and neither neither or any of you you can choose to be a warrior or you can choose to be a victim. You can choose to be a leader or I can choose to be a victim. Well, I, don't want to be a victim. I am NOT a victim and I. Won't. Let any government institution make me feel that I must be a victim simply because of my sexuality or my race, religion or gender. We are be, we've gotten so lost and things that, in the big scheme of things do not matter, our nation is crumbling. Our economy has come to a halt. We must rise up, Canada come together. It realized that we were told a big fat lie about conservatives and about how we should feel about conservatives or people with conservative values or morals or whatever, and realize that it's time to put the control back in the hands of the people, us Canadians and hold our institutions, the people governing us that they work for us and not the other way around I love. My Canada and I will never stop standing on guard for thee. Most of my videos I end by singing the national anthem and I'ma hope, you'll you're. Okay with that and I sing it. The way I was taught not the reworded one, but the one I was taught so here: I go Oh, Canada, our home and native land. True patriot love, he know Larson command with glowing hearts. We see thee rise, the True North, strong and free from far and wide o Canada. We stand on guard for thee, God, keep our land glorious and free o Canada. We stand on guard for thee, o Canada. We stand on guard for thee, have a good night Canada. It is time to walk away, take care everyone, [Music]."
56,52ZwaP8yTDU,my name is Terry and the reason I walked away from Democratic Party back in the 90s I voted for Bill Clinton and we marched on Washington with a quilt we tried to get money for AIDS charities and for AIDS research and they shot us down actually they didn't give us any of the money that we needed we started the Atlanta AIDS Walk we did everything that we could to get up money and then Hillary Clinton went on TV and said that marriage was between a man and a woman homosexuality was you know a sin so really left a bad taste in my mouth and that's when I left that party and it was really funny because you know she waited 20 years later and then tried to manipulate my children and yes I have three children and she tried to manipulate them into voting for her saying that she cared about my rights when so many of my brothers died of AIDS waiting for help that they didn't get from a party that promised they cared about us and didn't and didn't give us anything so that's when I left the party and I find it really funny because of anybody with a brain does any background check they'll see that president Trump donated a lot of money to AIDS charity and he helped us in many ways and that's something that they're not telling in the community that's something that none of my brothers are getting to hear about but they're all like they get into a frenzy and they want to argue with you know like stand up to your face and tell you you're an idiot and you're against your own when they don't even know the history you know a lot of these younger ones didn't even live through it they haven't seen what we saw and then there's the older ones that think just don't remember or don't want to remember you know they buried it with all of our dead brothers the three generations of gay males that died waiting for you know someone to do something for them and that's when I lost any luster that I had for the Democratic community and their party and for years I've been trying to wake up my brothers and my sisters and now look what they're doing to what we built what we fought to get rights for they're now bastardizing they're bringing in all these like anything they can things that back in the day we said would never happen you know we just want the same rights as everybody else and now all of a sudden they're bastardizing what we fought for so hard to make happen and I don't think that people are really opening their eyes and seeing that and I pray that my brothers and sisters open their eyes and see these people for what they really are they are totally for the fall of America and look at the people that they're putting in with like our equal rights and and our marches and and you know are these people if you look at their backgrounds they have nothing to do they with what you and I are really fighting for it what none of us as Americans want as Americans we all want to love each other black white green yellow orange purple whatever the hell we are we all want to respect each other we all want to help each other prosper we we go out of our way to help other countries but yet we're not helping ourselves anymore something has to change and I really think Trump is that change so and anything that I've said you can go and check you can find out its history people can't change history the the articles are there the videos are there everything's there look up what Hillary said look up when Trump gave us eight million dollars so these things you can find them they're very easy to locate know your enemy and unfortunately these days our enemy is the Democratic Party they're the enemy of everyone gay straight black white everybody because they want to segregate us if they separate us make us hate each other they can pick us off easier but if we all come together they can't do that that's what they're trying to do divide separate conquer and I babbled on but I just thought I'd get my point across and I've lost a lot of friends by saying what I've said to you in my community a lot of people I've had heated discussions with them and it's very hard to get someone has that liberal mindset to hear a fact or even go look it up and back in my day we we were liberals with facts you know we we knew what we were doing and these people they're not what we were and I'm glad you guys are waking up and God bless you and I hope you bring more people to the truth take care [Music],"My name is Terry and the reason I walked away from Democratic Party back in the 90s I voted for Bill Clinton and we marched on Washington with a quilt. We tried to get money for AIDS charities and for AIDS research and they shot us down. Actually they didn't give us any of the money that we needed. We started the Atlanta AIDS Walk. We did everything that we could to get up money and then Hillary Clinton went on TV and said that marriage was between a man and a woman. Homosexuality was, you know, a sin, so really left a bad taste in my mouth and that's when I left that party- and it was really funny because you know she waited 20 years later and then tried to manipulate my children and yes, I have three children and she tried to manipulate them into voting for her saying that she cared about my rights when so many of my brothers died of AIDS waiting for help that they didn't get from a party that promised they cared about us and didn't and didn't give us anything. So that's when I left the party and I find it really funny because of anybody with a brain. Does any background check they'll see that president Trump donated a lot of money to AIDS charity and he helped us in many ways and that's something that they're not telling in the community? That's something that none of my brothers are getting to hear about, but they're all like they get into a frenzy, and they want to argue with. You know like stand up to your face and tell you you're an idiot and you're against your own when they don't even know the history. You know a lot of these younger ones didn't even live through it. They haven't seen what we saw and then there's the older ones. That think just don't remember or don't want to remember. You know they buried it with all of our dead brothers. The three generations of gay males that died waiting for you know someone to do something for them and that's when I lost any luster that I had for the Democratic community and their party and for years I've been trying to wake up. My brothers and my sisters and now look what they're doing to what we built, what we fought to get rights for they're, now bastardizing they're, bringing in all these like anything. They can things that back in the day we said would never happen. You know we just want the same rights as everybody else and now all of a sudden, they're bastardizing what we fought for so hard to make happen and I, don't think that people are really opening their eyes and seeing that and I pray that my brothers and sisters open their eyes and see these people for what they really are, they are totally for the fall of America and look at the people that they're putting in with like our equal rights and and our marches and- and you know, are these people. If you look at their backgrounds, they have nothing to do they with what you and I are really fighting for it. What none of us as Americans want as Americans? We all want to love each other black white, green, yellow orange purple, whatever the hell we are, we all want to respect each other. We all want to help each other prosper. We we go out of our way to help other countries, but yet we're not helping ourselves anymore. Something has to change and I really think Trump is that change so and anything that I've said you can go and check you can find out its history. People can't change history. The the articles are there, the videos. Are there everything's there look up what Hillary said. Look up when Trump gave us eight million dollars, so these things you can find them they're very easy to locate, know your enemy and, unfortunately, these days our enemy is the Democratic Party they're, the enemy of everyone, gay straight black white everybody, because they want to segregate us. If they separate us make us hate each other. They can pick us off easier, but if we all come together, they can't do that. That's what they're trying to do divide, separate, conquer and I babbled on but I just thought, I'd get. My point across and I've lost a lot of friends. By saying what I've said to you in my community, a lot of people I've had heated discussions with them and it's very hard to get. Someone has that liberal mindset to hear a fact or even go look it up and back in my day, we we were liberals with facts. You know we we knew what we were doing and these people they're not what we were and I'm glad you guys are waking up and God bless. You and I hope you bring more people to the truth. Take care [Music]."
57,5H-6RvzCYeo,hi my name is Lisa I am a former 45 year registered Democrat who has decided to walk away I guess I started having this revelation about what was going on with my party back during the debate time when we were trying to pick a candidate to run against the Republican candidate and the DNC decided to force Hillary Clinton down our throats whether we wanted her or not and even went to the point of cheating I find the party left me I didn't leave them it's become a party of extreme left-wing extremists who are just filled with hate and anger disrespect lack of compassion lack of tolerance and that's not what the Democratic Party has represented to me for the last 45 years I joined the party right at the tail end of the Vietnam War it called to me it was to be an inclusive party that was going to represent all people of all color of all sexuality and it was the party of love and compassion and tolerance and respect for the freedom of speech and those those things are gone now now it's just name-calling tagging people that disagree with you a Nazi you know just some kind of a bigot a racist just a horrible name that has been used so many times now it doesn't even have an effect on people anymore and it's just identity politics and it's pretty disgusting I'm embarrassed at the direction of my party's gone it is certainly leaning more towards a Socialist Party now and none of my representatives have done anything to try to stop it and so they no longer share the values that I have and I will be taking my vote elsewhere I have moved more into the dependent and we'll be voting for who I want and I will not have a party dictating to me and forcing a candidate them throughout I could never in good conscience vote for Hillary Clinton and I am not a Russian I've never been to Russia I don't speak Russian I'm certainly not a robot to the best of my ability and I am just absolutely disgusted that mainstream media is trying to do its best to discredit this movement the movement now has a hundred and ten thousand people in it that are pretty much like me they're sick of the nasty politics and they just want to to be more moderate and so they've chosen to walk away and until the Democratic Party can do something to stop there their voters from the kind of behavior that's going on I think it's gonna continue to to lose members and it's unfortunate because I always believe that the Democratic Party was the pollak party of tolerance and it certainly isn't thank you,"Hi, my name is Lisa I am a former 45 year registered Democrat, who has decided to walk away. I guess I started having this revelation about what was going on with my party back during the debate time when we were trying to pick a candidate to run against the Republican candidate and the DNC decided to force Hillary Clinton down our throats, whether we wanted her or not and even went to the point of cheating I find the party left me: I didn't leave them. It's become a party of extreme left-wing extremists who are just filled with hate and anger, disrespect, lack of compassion, lack of tolerance, and that's not what the Democratic Party has represented to me. For the last 45 years, I joined the party right at the tail end of the Vietnam War. It called to me it was to be an inclusive party that was going to represent all people of all color of all sexuality, and it was the party of love and compassion and tolerance and respect for the freedom of speech and those those things are gone now now it's just name-calling tagging people that disagree with you. A Nazi, you know just some kind of a bigot, a racist, just a horrible name that has been used so many times now. It doesn't even have an effect on people anymore and it's just identity politics and it's pretty disgusting I'm embarrassed at the direction of my party's gone. It is certainly leaning more towards a Socialist Party now and none of my representatives have done anything to try to stop it, and so they no longer share the values that I have and I will be. Taking my vote elsewhere, I have moved more into the dependent and we'll be voting for who I want and I will not have a party dictating to me and forcing a candidate them throughout I could never in good conscience. Vote for Hillary, Clinton and I am not a Russian I've, never been to Russia I, don't speak Russian I'm, certainly not a robot to the best of my ability and I am just absolutely disgusted that mainstream media is trying to do its best to discredit this movement. The movement now has a hundred and ten thousand people in it that are pretty much like me. They're sick of the nasty politics- and they just want to to be more moderate and so they've chosen to walk away and until the Democratic Party can do something to stop there. Their voters from the kind of behavior that's going on. I think it's gonna continue to to lose members and it's unfortunate because I always believe that the Democratic Party was the pollak party of tolerance and it certainly isn't. Thank you."
58,5Hxm-XYK2YY,hey everybody my name is jessica parker and i've been um wanting to do this for a while my puppy is going to try and get up here six month old giant um i don't really know where to start i'm very very very grateful for this group um i grew up in a family i'm in oregon that um politics weren't a thing when i was growing up we went to church uh my parents um taught sunday school and all the things and then um when i was in fifth grade they got a divorce and things just kind of unraveled and um i ended up being the only one going to church after that so um i credit a lot of my life and my my health whether it be spiritually emotionally all of it to my faith um because you know my family is very dysfunctional as are like many um but as i got older i definitely um definitely encountered a lot of i would call it bullying from my family my dad and my sister in particular for my faith um and i have always been kind of um people pleaser and tried to keep the peace in my family and just never spoke up and then as i um went through college i also will have to say my mom came from a conservative family my dad came from the liberal family and i didn't really pay attention to that until i got older um but um anyway i went through college i have a master's degree and i always really took pride in not being extreme on one end or the other and just like being kind of moderate and seeing things from both sides i took pride in that um but as i got even older my dad became more extreme in his um liberal perspective and you know very angry i've seen a lot of anger from my dad and my sister and i'm a twin actually and um my sister um is a lesbian and you know um i'm 43 trying to think of when she came out it's probably been like maybe 10 years um and i love everybody i take pride in that i really do i have never ever ever ever said a mean thing i don't even feel it you know why would i say it and um yet i've been i have been um labeled and judged for how she thinks that i believe and then my dad as well in terms of my faith and political beliefs even when he was wrong actually because i haven't always voted republican i haven't and one year when before i have a 14 year old before he was born um so 2004 um election time and i was renting a room out of my dad's house and um came home and you know my dad um has a drinking problem and pretty sure he was um a little bit drunk and high and um he had been on his computer back in the dial-up days and was raging mad and followed me around the house veins popping out red in the face tossed me up against the wall and was this close to me like spitting in my face about the election and me voting republican and actually i didn't even know who i was going to vote for like he he definitely um had preconceived ideas about me um obviously because of my faith and he never even bothered to ask me i quickly escaped that situation and he did apologize later and um anyway all that to say and my sister and i have not spoke for a while um in 2016 when the whole black lives matter thing um kind of first came about um i remember posting i try to like not be like very political or very anything on social media um but i i posted a picture of a circle of people black white some cops they were holding hands and they were praying i actually made it like my cover photo i felt like it just spoke volumes and um and i i know like so many people were hurting anyway she blasted me on facebook because apparently our ancestors had slaves like i don't even know um and how dare i which it still doesn't make sense to me how dare i what i'm not sure um i immediately blocked her and then she texted me nasty things so i blocked her there she emailed me nasty things blocked her there so she actually sent me a very nasty letter and um said very nasty things about my faith and so i've kept it just just as a reminder because i tend to um you know want to forgive and forget but i every time i've done that i'm i paid for it so anyway needless to say um all the things have really made me um more and more conservative because of i've just seen the light more and more um you know i went to oregon state university and i was in um on a liberal arts track and then psychology and my master's is health psychology i'm a health coach um and i really started going down a more toxin-free living road and um i have mercury amalgams and i have um they think possibly ms and i've i've connected the dots there because i had a lot of amalgams worked on i'm right before my symptoms really hit and it was devastating to me um to my life two years ago um and so i've really really taken a root cause approach to my health ever since well a little bit before that and figuring some things out and noticing things with my parents and mainstream medicine and that actually led me to trump believe it or not i was sad that he was um even um up for election in 2016 i thought it was horrible because i just listened to everybody else and the news but i also equally hated hillary for my own reasons i mean just anyway i was never i i didn't want to be political because all all the negative like hateful things from my dad and my sister um but i i voted for trump reluctantly lester of two evils and then um really it's been within the last year it has really been within the last year um when i've um i've really become aware of like the mandates that we're facing started with vaccines and then all these other things and um so definitely woke me up in huge ways and i wish that i would have paid attention to politics a long time ago um we're in oregon i feel like we have a dictator you know she has she called a special session right now and um why who even knows um she's done nothing for us i have people my neighbor hasn't received um checks and might have to move i mean i i know handfuls of people we have not received our stimulus check um and thankfully we're doing fine and i'm not worried about it but um there's been so much mismanagement in this state and i already didn't like our governor because of um really horrible things happening with human services and children and foster homes and stuff like that in our state um horrible things and so anyway i just wish that i had paid attention before but i'm so thankful for this group i'm so thankful um it's really easy to um get down and get kind of pulled into some of the negative going on in the world and i'm so thankful there are so many people all across the board and um i feel like i have friends that like are on the same page i've definitely lost friends um throughout this because i've decided to speak up a little more i try to be very not neutral but um not divisive either i really try hard to do that and not constantly putting stuff out but um i've definitely lost friends who you know i i count them as not having bench for friends to begin with i really do but i'm not speaking with my dad right now not speaking even with my mom and my stepdad because they are afraid of trump they think he's a dictator and anyway thank you brandon for this group i am so thankful for it i [Music] see everybody's

If my parents saw this they're passed away, bless their hearts, but if they saw this they would walk away too. Trying to defend the police is about the worst idea I have ever heard um. You know. I realized that I had never really given trump a chance. I had never really listened to him talk um, only those little tiny, sound clips that um you see on tv and they always make him look as bad as possible, but once I really started listening to him and finding out what the things that he's actually doing to help our country and how much he loves our country and um. I just realized that I had just been wrong and [Music]. You know I know he's not a saint, and I understand why people don't like him, but you know you don't have to like him as a person to see that he is doing good things for the country and that he loves the country and seeing I just feel like everything is going down the drain and he's the only thing standing between us and I don't know going down the toilet. So that's my story, um. Thank you very much have a good day. You."
60,5LdnEXgoLAM,hello YouTube this is fly over kami and welcome to my new channel I wasn't quite sure what video I wanted to have my first video be and since the walk away campaign is so explosive right now I thought I would tell my story about walking away so here we go I think that probably during Bush juniors years and trying to get his attention for issues that were personally impacting my life that that was probably the beginning of my eyes opening because no matter what I did no matter how many letters I wrote to then George Bush jr. it didn't matter I never got a response not even a form letter to at least acknowledge that I had concerns that I felt needed to be addressed on behalf of myself and millions of Americans so I kind of disheartened went on to the Democrat Party and sadly I don't think I really knew what the Democrats or the Republicans were all about I do recall hearing many times that Republicans are for the rich people and Democrats are for the people that aren't rich and since I wasn't a rich person I must be a Democrat and I'm not really good at following the crowd so I think maybe part of me always spot against being one party or the other I just wanted whoever was in charge to listen to what I had to say because I was gonna vote for somebody and whoever I was going to vote for needed to be supportive of the causes that were important to me and sadly it didn't happen with the Democrat Party or the Republican Party nobody listened the establishment does not listen to the little people because we're not the establishment it's all disgusting so I had gone to once I moved on from the Republican Party back in the George Bush jr. days I went on to the Democrats and I tried to get the attention of John Kerry the attention of John Edwards when they are running for president and both of them gave me the same line when I asked my question to them in their rallies are their visits to my community and their answer was we'll look into it and of course they never looked into it nobody ever looks into anything unless you give them lots of money and it doesn't impact who's contributing dollars to their campaign so I was pissed off about those two and then Obama comes along so I wrote Obama multiple letters never heard anything and so I did I only voted for Obama once so the second time around I had a real big wake-up call or red pill moment or whatever you'd call it when I was in line at the store because the ladies behind me we're talking about who they were voting for in 2012 and you'll never guess why they were voting for Obama they said they were voting for Obama because his wife was beautiful are you kidding me does it dumbest thing I ever heard we're voting for the person that's going to leave the country because their wife is beautiful I I was dumbfounded so I went home and thought okay this can't be why people vote for the president and then I thought to myself I have no idea why I'm even voting for who I'm voting for so I had to pay attention so I didn't vote for Obama I thought maybe I could get the attention of John McCain nope no chance the only person that I felt at that point that paid any attention to the little people with Sarah Palin and they destroyed her on Saturday Night Live God and I I think that was when I kind of stopped watching television I would occasionally watch some programs but I never watched Saturday Night Live again after the horrible way they treated Sarah Palin and of course now my god if they didn't have President Trump to harass on Saturday Night Live they wouldn't have a show in fact I don't think CNN would be alive today or MSNBC or half of the other fake news media because if they didn't have Trump - - they wouldn't have a network should be called the Trump bashing Network and I'm glad everybody's turning it off I stopped watching the news a long time ago and I stopped watching the news because I was sick of the commercials drug commercial galore that's all it is it's like the drug news network you have to have I don't even think anybody else I'm sponsors the news every commercial is a drug commercial and I am NOT a fan of the pharmaceutical industry but that's a really long video we'll get into another time so when President Trump came down that escalator I thought you know what maybe he's different and I listened to what he had to say and he actually talked about some of the things that were important to me so I kind of started to pay attention to him and when he came to my town for a rally I got a hold of his campaign staff in my state and said I really need to get up close to him because I have to give him a letter it's so important so the people from his campaign got back in touch with me they had me meet them at the rally here in my area and they let me in with them and then into the front row so I actually had a chance to spend like I don't know it seemed like a really long time to me but it was probably only like two minutes that mr. Trump stopped I gave him my letter and I gotta ask him a couple questions and instead of a yes and no answer that you would probably expect for most people he actually gave me some answers and then asked me questions so he kind of had a back-and-forth for a couple minutes that I don't gather he would remember after all of the people that he's met across the country but I will never forget it because it was the first time in 18 years that anybody and the political sphere has paid a damn bit of attention to what I had to say and I was just I can't even explain how excited I was I think I cried the whole time I had my Brittany moment the whole way home because I was so shocked that of all the people and all the places in all of the commotion that he had time to talk to me and listen and that's a pretty amazing feeling to know that while our now president had a moment for me and paid attention to what I had to say so um I don't think I'm a Republican I don't think I'm a Democrat I know I'm not a Democrat for crying out loud but I think we're a three-party system in this country now we have the Looney tune liberals we have the dim or the Republicans and there's a handful of good ones but then we have the party of Trump and that is where I am so I vote for him in 2020 I love our president and I love how he is making America great again he's really giving the power back to the people and it's such a shame that there's so many people in this country that don't know it yet everything that he's doing isn't just for part of the population is for all of us this is America first and that's not a crime and the stupid fake news that thinks that America first is a crime those people are nuts it is not a crime to be America first and for the American people when you're the president it's not a crime to want your country to succeed or to be great and safe and successful that's smart but then again the fake news isn't smart their job is to destroy the president and I don't know what the hell else they do but I guess it's really kind of funny if you do happen across them on YouTube it's kind of embarrassing I'm embarrassed for all of them they're making such fools of themselves and I'm even more embarrassed for the people that haven't woke up yet that actually sit there and believe everything that CNN and MSNBC says like it's gospel it's ridiculous it is definitely fake news but it has been fake news for a very long time far before the 2016 election the 2016 election just kind of made it worse and now they have somebody to charge it and they have something to talk about even if it's so that is my walkaway story I walked away a long time ago for a long time I just kind of walked around the circle because they didn't exactly know where I belong but I know that I belong with our president and I'm so glad so many people are walking away and we're all coming together as Americans and standing up for what's right and standing up for our president and standing up for the truth so I look forward to talking to everybody again and thank you so much for watching,"Hello YouTube, this is fly over kami and welcome to my new channel. I wasn't quite sure what video I wanted to have my first video be and since the walk away campaign is so explosive right now, I thought I would tell my story about walking away. So here we go I think that, probably during Bush juniors years and trying to get his attention for issues that were personally impacting my life, that that was probably the beginning of my eyes. Opening, because no matter what I did no matter, how many letters I wrote to then George Bush jr. it didn't matter. I never got a response, not even a form letter to at least acknowledge that I had concerns that I felt needed to be addressed on behalf of myself and millions of Americans. So I kind of disheartened went on to the Democrat, Party and sadly I. Don't think I really knew what the Democrats or the Republicans were all about. I do recall, hearing many times that Republicans are for the rich people and Democrats are for the people that aren't rich and since I wasn't a rich person. I must be a Democrat and I'm, not really good at following the crowd, so I think maybe part of me always spot against being one party or the other I just wanted. Whoever was in charge to listen to what I had to say, because I was gonna vote for somebody and whoever I was going to vote for needed to be supportive of the causes that were important to me and sadly, it didn't happen with the Democrat Party or the Republican Party. Nobody listened. The establishment does not listen to the little people because we're not the establishment. It's all disgusting, so I had gone to once. I moved on from the Republican Party back in the George Bush jr. days, I went on to the Democrats and I tried to get the attention of John Kerry the attention of John Edwards when they are running for president and both of them gave me the same line when I asked my question to them in their rallies are their visits to my community and their answer was we'll look into it and, of course they never looked into it. Nobody ever looks into anything unless you give them lots of money and it doesn't impact who's contributing dollars to their campaign. So I was pissed off about those two and then Obama comes along, so I wrote, Obama, multiple letters never heard anything, and so I did I only voted for Obama once so. The second time around I had a real big wake-up call or red pill moment or whatever you'd call it. When I was in line at the store, because the ladies behind me we're talking about who they were voting for in 2012 and you'll, never guess why they were voting for Obama. They said they were voting for Obama because his wife was beautiful. Are you kidding me? Does it dumbest thing? I ever heard we're voting for the person that's going to leave the country because their wife is beautiful. I I was dumbfounded, so I went home and thought okay. This can't be why people vote for the president and then I thought to myself. I have no idea why I'm, even voting for who I'm voting for so I had to pay attention. So I didn't vote for Obama I thought. Maybe I could get the attention of John McCain nope, no chance the only person that I felt at that point that paid any attention to the little people with Sarah Palin and they destroyed her on Saturday, Night, Live, God and I I. Think that was when I kind of stopped watching television I would occasionally watch some programs but I never watched Saturday, Night Live again after the horrible way they treated Sarah, Palin and, of course, now, my god, if they didn't have President Trump to harass on Saturday Night Live, they wouldn't have a show, in fact I. Don't think CNN would be alive today or MSNBC or half of the other fake news media, because if they didn't have Trump - -, they wouldn't have a network should be called the Trump bashing, Network and I'm glad everybody's turning it off. I stopped watching the news a long time ago and I stopped watching the news, because I was sick of the commercials drug commercial galore. That's all it is it's like the drug news network. You have to have I, don't even think anybody else. I'm sponsors, the news: every commercial is a drug, commercial and I am NOT a fan of the pharmaceutical industry, but that's a really long, video we'll get into another time. So when President Trump came down that escalator I thought you know what maybe he's different and I listened to what he had to say and he actually talked about some of the things that were important to me. So I kind of started to pay attention to him and when he came to my town for a rally, I got a hold of his campaign staff in my state and said: I really need to get up close to him, because I have to give him a letter. It's so important, so the people from his campaign got back in touch with me. They had me meet them at the rally here in my area and they let me in with them and then into the front row, so I actually had a chance to spend like I. Don't know it seemed like a really long time to me, but it was probably only like two minutes that mr. Trump stopped I gave him my letter and I gotta. Ask him a couple questions, and instead of a yes and no answer that you would probably expect for most people, he actually gave me some answers and then asked me questions. So he kind of had a back-and-forth for a couple minutes that I don't gather. He would remember, after all of the people that he's met across the country, but I will never forget it, because it was the first time in 18 years that anybody and the political sphere has paid a damn bit of attention to what I had to say and I was just I, can't even explain how excited I was I. Think I cried the whole time. I had my Brittany moment the whole way home, because I was so shocked, that of all the people and all the places in all of the commotion that he had time to talk to me and listen, and that's a pretty amazing feeling to know that, while our now president had a moment for me and paid attention to what I had to say so, um I, don't think I'm a Republican I, don't think I'm a Democrat I know I'm, not a Democrat for crying out loud, but I think we're a three-party system in this country. Now we have the Looney tune. Liberals we have the dim or the Republicans and there's a handful of good ones, but then we have the party of Trump, and that is where I am so I vote for him in 2020, I love, our president and I love how he is making America great again he's really giving the power back to the people, and it's such a shame that there's so many people in this country that don't know it. Yet everything that he's doing isn't just for part of the population is for all of us. This is America first and that's not a crime and the stupid fake news that thinks that America first is a crime. Those people are nuts. It is not a crime to be America first and for the American people when you're the president. It's not a crime to want your country to succeed or to be great and safe and successful. That's smart! But then again the fake news isn't smart. Their job is to destroy the president and I. Don't know what the hell else they do, but I guess it's really kind of funny. If you do happen across them on YouTube, it's kind of embarrassing I'm embarrassed for all of them, they're, making such fools of themselves and I'm even more embarrassed for the people that haven't woke up yet that actually sit there and believe everything that CNN and MSNBC says like it's gospel. It's ridiculous! It is definitely fake news, but it has been fake news for a very long time. Far before the 2016 election, the 2016 election just kind of made it worse and now they have somebody to charge it and they have something to talk about, even if it's so that is my walkaway story. I walked away a long time ago for a long time, I just kind of walked around the circle because they didn't exactly know where I belong, but I know that I belong with our president and I'm so glad so many people are walking away and we're all coming together as Americans and standing up for what's right and standing up for our president and standing up for the truth. So I look forward to talking to everybody again and thank you so much for watching."
61,5pOXa5ZwM8A,my name is AJ I use he him they them pronouns and I made a video last year or so I think for this group and I was just really nervous and not very confident at the time I had a lot of anxiety so it was very short and and I just wanted to make a longer one that I was more comfortable with and more confident with so I know last year the admins had wanted to use the video for something and I didn't want them to so this this time it's it's okay so you guys can use this however you however you need to but anyway I just wanted to give a little bit of information about myself and tell you a little bit about my background hopefully I won't make this too long so I am a member of the LGBTQ community I identify as non-binary and demisexual panromantic all that stuff if you have any questions about what any of that means you can comment or private message me that's fine I I grew up in a house that was democratic until I became a teenager and then they kind of went like my my parents went the other way too into far right and I also went far right and now I'm more independent um for instance I support the LGBTQ community but I'm also pro-life I am very much anti-abortion I want to secure our borders I want a flat tax I I support the Trump administration in most of what they do and I I think that the states should be able to make a lot more decisions they are currently making I think that a lot of things that the federal government currently controls should be handled by the state side really heavily believe in the 1st and the 10th amendments of course all of the amendments but I'm often advocating for those as well as the Second Amendment I am a legal gun owner I am going pheasant hunting for the first time this December but I find that I am just an independent and my beliefs and my values kind of are more on the conservative side but I treat every individual issue and look and every individual issue separately from the collective I guess I don't listen to the news anymore I have an anxiety disorder not it's just I get my news from family and friends and then I go and research what they've said to me or I get it from this group or my other conservative groups and that's good enough for me because the MSM is just not not doing justice to actual news so my point in introducing myself is to say that I am not the typical Trump supporter I am biologically female I identify on you know the non-binary scale I am part of the LGBTQ community and by every rule I guess imposed on me by society I should not be a fan of President Trump and I am and I'm really proud of Mike Pence and I am in Indiana I think that he was a very good governor our our state did very very well under him and I think he's been a very good vice president I'm super proud of him and I like the trumpet station and I'm I should be a Democrat by every stretch of the imagination and I'm not because I read I'm sorry that was a little salty um no but I I look at each individual issue and I I dive deeply into it I don't just trust headlines I don't just trust what people say I don't listen to hearsay I look for the truth and the truth has led me to walk away from liberalism and and the Democratic Party maybe if it was the same Democratic Party that it was back in the eighties or something I would be more inclined to be part of it but as it stands right now so that's my story and if the admins or something wants to use this in whatever project they can if you have any questions about anything that I believe or stand for or identify as or whatever um you guys can comment or private message me that last time I made one of these posts I got so many comments and messages that my Facebook app crashed multiple times in a day so I I just really like to have that dialogue going though and I know that a lot of people have a lot of questions when they realize that I am what should be stereotypically Democratic and I'm not I'm also a Christian I used to be a witch when I was teenager ish and now I'm a Christian and I still identify as trans non-binary and all that stuff and and a lot of people sometimes have questions about that too so if you have any questions if you want to know any information just let me know just please be respectful and I'll be respectful back so I think that our world has forgotten how to be compassionate and think that compassion is something that's desperately needed nowadays so I do my best it's not in my nature um but I do my best to answer with compassion and the truth and try to word my opinions to the best of my ability so that other people can understand my thought process so yeah just let me know thanks for listening and I'm I've been a part of the walk away group since July of last year I think something like that it's been a while and I love seeing all your stories so thanks so much for listening to me and catch on the foot side you,"My name is AJ I use he him they them pronouns and I made a video last year or so. I think for this group and I was just really nervous and not very confident at the time. I had a lot of anxiety, so it was very short and and I just wanted to make a longer one that I was more comfortable with and more confident with so I know. Last year the admins had wanted to use the video for something and I didn't want them to so this. This time it's it's okay, so you guys can use this. However, you, however, you need to, but anyway I just wanted to give a little bit of information about myself and tell you a little bit about my background. Hopefully, I won't make this too long. So I am a member of the LGBTQ community I identify as non-binary and demisexual panromantic all that stuff. If you have any questions about what any of that means you can comment or private message me. That's fine, I I grew up in a house that was democratic until I became a teenager and then they kind of went like my. My parents went the other way too into far right and I also went far right and now I'm, more independent um, for instance, I support the LGBTQ community, but I'm. Also pro-life I am very much anti-abortion. I want to secure our borders. I want a flat tax. I I support the Trump administration in most of what they do and I I think that the states should be able to make a lot more decisions. They are currently making I think that a lot of things that the federal government currently controls should be handled by the state side, really heavily believe in the 1st and the 10th amendments. Of course, all of the amendments but I'm often advocating for those as well as the Second Amendment I, am a legal gun owner I am going pheasant hunting for the first time. This December, but I, find that I am just an independent and my beliefs and my values kind of are more on the conservative side, but I treat every individual issue and look and every individual issue separately from the collective I. Guess: I, don't listen to the news anymore. I have an anxiety disorder, not it's. Just I get my news from family and friends and then I go and research. What they've said to me or I, get it from this group or my other conservative groups, and that's good enough for me, because the MSM is just not not doing justice to actual news. So my point in introducing myself is to say that I am not the typical Trump supporter I am biologically female I identify on you know the non-binary scale. I am part of the LGBTQ community and by every rule, I guess imposed on me by society. I should not be a fan of President Trump and I am and I'm really proud of. Mike Pence and I am in Indiana I think that he was a very good governor. Our our state did very, very well under him and I think he's been a very good vice president I'm super proud of him and I like the trumpet station and I'm I, should be a Democrat by every stretch of the imagination and I'm, not because I read I'm sorry that was a little salty um. No, but I I look at each individual issue and I I dive deeply into it. I, don't just trust headlines, I, don't just trust what people say: I, don't listen to hearsay, I, look for the truth and the truth has led me to walk away from liberalism and and the Democratic Party. Maybe if it was the same Democratic Party that it was back in the eighties or something I would be more inclined to be part of it, but as it stands right now, so that's my story and if the admins or something wants to use this in whatever project they can, if you have any questions about anything that I believe or stand for or identify as or whatever um, you guys can comment or private message me that last time I made one of these posts. I got so many comments and messages that my Facebook app crashed multiple times in a day, so I I just really like to have that dialogue. Going though, and I know that a lot of people have a lot of questions when they realize that I am what should be stereotypically, Democratic and I'm, not I'm. Also a Christian I used to be a witch when I was teenager, ish and now I'm, a Christian and I still identify as trans non-binary and all that stuff and and a lot of people sometimes have questions about that too. So, if you have any questions, if you want to know any information, just let me know just please be respectful and I'll be respectful back, so I think that our world has forgotten how to be compassionate and think that compassion is something that's desperately needed nowadays. So I do my best. It's not in my nature um, but I do my best to answer with compassion and the truth and try to word my opinions to the best of my ability so that other people can understand my thought process. So yeah. Just let me know, thanks for listening and I'm I've been a part of the walk away group since July of last year. I think something like that. It's been a while and I love, seeing all your stories. So thanks so much for listening to me and catch on the foot side. You."
62,5RL8moo-UyQ,in the 1970s I was a card-carrying money supporting campaigning Democrat had some problems with the Democratic Party because I'm also I was born and raised Catholic my folks are heavy-duty Democrats they believed you have to look at each candidate to decide who it is you want to vote for and they always voted a straight Democratic line which I did too for a while until I decided I couldn't follow some of the Democratic beliefs because of the fact that I'm a Christian and I'll just put it out there the one that took me away was the fact that I am pro-life and the Democrats are not that was the straw that broke the camel's back way back when then when Bill Clinton was elected as president I had a friend who had been elected to Congress great man he went to school Oh a few years ahead of me he was a lawyer and I worked his campaign even though he was a Democrat and I was not anymore I really believed in the man he won he went to DC and he was there for two years when he came back home on their first leave he made it known to all of us that as soon as his term was up he was done and I asked him I said Jim why and he's done Washington DC is unlike any place he said you go in you're immediately told what you can and can't do how are you were going to vote who you're going to talk to you and then you have people come in who talk to you for five minutes and leave basically a pile of money on your desk and say just make sure you get this debt okay and he said I called many of them and told them no you're I don't take bribes take the money and go and he said I went to votes and I went to parties and I did things with everybody else and quickly found out that dice you were living back home and in a modest forty fifty sixty thousand dollar house we're now selling their houses and buying a million dollar houses on the other side of the county and not even sticking with their constituents who voted him in because there's so much money from so many different places and he said if I say there I'll lose my soul the founding fathers told us if we went to a two-party system the country would not last they warned us and you can read this it's it's in their own hands but they they told us that the parties will become corrupt the money will be too much the power will be too much it won't be the will of the people it will be the will of the party and we're seeing that with the Democrats and the new socialist agenda Maxine Waters calling out all of her supporters to don't let them go in P place in public harass them tear them down don't let them go hey we got the same thing on the Republican Party nothing the same extent right now but we did I remember the things that came out about Hillary and about Barack Obama no I wasn't fans I'm not supporters and I would not have voted for Hillary had been the only person running but that's beside the point the fact is they're calling right now because of the immigration crisis the peak little children that are being torn from their mothers arms and most of these people when you see them reunited the kids don't even know who the people are that they're reuniting him with it's obvious watch CNN see it happen it happens it's not about immigration it's about money it's not about the people it's about the money that they can earn there's a huge sex trade traffic yes slaves sex slaves all over the country and there's a huge narcotics ring do you really think the cartels in Mexico have the money to lather all the hams to take care of things here no it's the politicians it's

63,5u5BT-yFv3U,"my name is ms mi Z Parker on Twitter and this is my walk away I'm not a young person as you can tell I'm 59 I've never missed any election I've never missed any voting in elections or any midterms my whole life I have voted Democrat my whole life that's about to change my story is all my life I I had a real bad situation when I was a kid and I had to have an abortion I was raped and I had to have an abortion and I was told that abortion is just tissue you know it's not a real person yet and you know all these things I've since come to believe since last election that abortion is not just tissue and finding the films on Planned Parenthood selling body parts of children was the beginning of my red-billed of walk away but anyway let's get back to elections so on the last election I went into the voting booth and I was really excited because I thought I was going to vote for Hillary for president and a week before the election it had come out that Hillary's emails had been discovered on her I think her laptop or something I'm not sure but Comey had come out and said they were gonna reopen the investigation that she might actually be you know have problems so with this heavily on my mind I go into the voting booth and every year you every every presidential election it's like the vote for the president is like the best vote ever so it's like dessert so you vote for all the people in the voting and then you go back and you vote for the president last and that's what I've always done because that's like the icing on the cake for voting is voting for the president but in 2016 I'm standing in the voting booth and I voted for everybody and I I can't I can't push the vote for Hillary I can't believe I'm talking about it now I get emotional then I'm standing in the voting booth and I'm looking at the names and all I can think of is what happens if I vote for the first female president and she becomes impeached I I've been proud of all the people I voted for I had been completely fooled by Obama I thought he was a good president I didn't really have any concept of what he had done certainly didn't know what he did in Benghazi so I was locked I just I stood there I was there for at least five ten minutes voted in Nevada I lived in North Vegas at the time and the guy from the poll thing he came over like you okay okay no I'm fine I I just can't make a decision he said well you were supposed to make a decision before you got here and I said well I thought I did but the problem is when I go to push the button my brain is like so I stand there thinking and I can't make a decision and then it hits me you know you're from Vegas and one of the things Vegas teaches you is play the odds so what are the odds of Hillary getting problems or getting a beach well I started thinking about all the scandal she's been involved in and I like man she may not be able to get out of this one dismissed should be a serious scandal so I reached over I push the bed in for Trump and in Vegas once you push that thing you can't go back and change it so I push the butt for Trump and I immediately burst into tears and walked away I thought that was a lot quite moment Oh was I wrong so I leave I leave the polling place and I'm sick because I think I've cast a vote against women I I feel like I let down Hillary I feel like I let down women it just sitting here thinking about that feeling that day it was just awful it was awful and I was so brainwashed I was so brainwashed so I left the voting booth and I go home and for the first time in my life I don't watch the election returns because I'm I'm horrified at what I had done I at the time I push the button in the suit I push the button I went oh god what did you do so I left I went to bed that night about nine o'clock I didn't even watch anything the next morning on TV there was this lady whose name is Rachel Maddox and I had I know who a Jo Maddox was I don't watch TV that much but I wanted to know you know I wanted to see how much Hillary had one bite and this is what I see I turn on the TV and this is what I see in this woman is she's like seriously sorry it's like upset and mad just like this is not a joke this is real President Trump Donald Trump is your president Donald Trump was elected president the United States the entire country lost its mind the voted for Trump oh my god what's gonna happen now it's like a business we're off the tracks now folks we're not in Kansas anymore boy what is gonna happen so I was like mildly interested to this maybe this isn't gonna be so bad so I called my family and they're just my daughter's were upset my family's upset it's like what Hilary's supposed to win lalalala I don't see nothing I don't take it you think I don't tell my mother for drama like I'm chicken and so climb goes by and man the economy is changing everything's coming well I start looking into different things and reading about different things and learning stuff and then all of a sudden in November this thing called Q non comes up and I start reading it and one of the first things that I started researching was Planned Parenthood and when I saw the videos online of what Planned Parenthood actually did with aborted fetuses and I started checking email Hilary's ties to it and I started going down the rabbit hole and so now I know our country is at war and it's a silent war and there's very few people that know what's going on most of the country doesn't know it's gonna break pretty soon I'm pretty sure we have over 50,000 indictments that is gonna change everything when that breaks the entire country is against our president and I'm not I'm a patriot to the core I believe in our country I believe in our freedoms and the more I read pilled myself the more research I did the more I realized we are lucky lucky blessed blessed beyond blessed god has touched our nation to put the president in office he win an election against the Democrats attempts against the Republicans they were all after him and he's won but the Democrats are controlling the media they are trying to control the United States and they're trying to make us go into one world order and I'm just not gonna have a part of it because I love my country America first so I'm a patriot and I will never vote Democratic again I walked away from the Democratic Party I urge you

this is my walk away: I'm, not a young person, as you can tell I'm, 59 I've never missed any election, I've, never missed any voting in elections or any midterms. My whole life I have voted Democrat. My whole life. That's about to change. My story is all my life. I I had a real bad situation. When I was a kid and I had to have an abortion, I was raped and I had to have an abortion and I was told that abortion is just tissue. You know it's not a real person yet, and you know all these things I've since come to believe since last election that abortion is not just tissue and finding the films on Planned Parenthood selling body parts of children was the beginning of my red-billed of walk away, but anyway, let's get back to elections.

Thinking and I can't make a decision, and then it hits me. You know you're from Vegas and one of the things Vegas teaches you is play the odds. So what are the odds of Hillary getting problems or getting a beach? Well I started. Thinking about all the scandal she's been involved in and I like man, she may not be able to get out of this. One dismissed should be a serious scandal, so I reached over I push the bed in for Trump and in Vegas. Once you push that thing, you can't go back and change it, so I push the butt for Trump and I immediately burst into tears and walked away. I thought that was a lot quite moment. Oh was I wrong, so I leave I, leave the polling place and I'm sick, because I think I've cast a vote against women. I I feel like I. Let down Hillary I feel like I. Let down women it just sitting here. Thinking about that feeling that day it was just awful, it was awful and I was so brainwashed. I was so brainwashed, so I left the voting, booth and I go home and for the first time in my life, I don't watch the election returns because I'm I'm horrified at what I had done I at the time. I push the button in the suit I push the button. I went, oh god, what did you do so? I left I went to bed that night about nine o'clock. I didn't even watch anything the next morning on TV. There was this lady, whose name is Rachel Maddox and I had I know who a Jo Maddox was I. Don't watch TV that much but I wanted to know. You know I wanted to see how much Hillary had one bite, and this is what I see I turn on the TV, and this is what I see in this woman is she's like seriously sorry, it's like upset and mad. Just like this is not a joke. This is real President Trump, Donald Trump is your president. Donald Trump was elected president. The United States, the entire country, lost its mind. The voted for Trump, oh my god. What's gonna happen now it's like a business, we're off the tracks now folks we're not in Kansas anymore boy. What is gonna happen so I was like mildly interested to this. Maybe this isn't gonna be so bad, so I called my family and they're. Just my daughter's were upset. My family's upset. It's like what Hilary's supposed to win. Lalalala I, don't see nothing I, don't take it. You think I don't tell my mother for drama like I'm, chicken and so climb goes by and man the economy is changing. Everything's coming well, I start looking into different things and reading about different things and learning stuff and then all of a sudden in November this thing called Q non comes up and I start reading it and one of the first things that I started researching was Planned Parenthood and when I saw the videos online of what Planned Parenthood actually did with aborted fetuses and I started, checking email, Hilary's ties to it and I started going down the rabbit hole, and so now I know our country is at war and it's a silent war and there's very few people that know. What's going on, most of the country doesn't know it's gonna break pretty soon, I'm, pretty sure we have over 50,000 indictments. That is gonna change. Everything when that breaks the entire country is against our president and I'm, not I'm a patriot to the core I believe in our country, I, believe in our freedoms and the more I read pilled myself, the more research I did, the more I realized we are lucky lucky blessed blessed beyond blessed. God has touched our nation to put the president in office. He win an election against the Democrats attempts against the Republicans. They were all after him and he's won, but the Democrats are controlling the media. They are trying to control the United, States and they're. Trying to make us go into one world order and I'm. Just not gonna have a part of it because I love my country, America first so I'm, a patriot and I, will never vote. Democratic again. I walked away from the Democratic Party I urge you to do the same. I urge you to support this president I urge you to do research I urge you to find out more about the very people that you put your trust in, because much of it is a smoke screen. I urge you to walk away from the Democrats they're, not telling you the truth. You, my name is ms mi Z Parker on Twitter, and this is my walk away: I'm, not a young person, as you can tell I'm, 59 I've never missed any election, I've, never missed any voting in elections or any midterms. My whole life I have voted Democrat. My whole life. That's about to change. My story is all my life. I I had a real bad situation. When I was a kid and I had to have an abortion, I was raped and I had to have an abortion and I was told that abortion is just tissue. You know it's not a real person yet, and you know all these things I've since come to believe since last election that abortion is not just tissue and finding the films on Planned Parenthood selling body parts of children was the beginning of my red-billed. Of walk away, but anyway, let's get back to elections so on the last election, I went into the voting, booth and I was really excited because I thought I was going to vote for Hillary for president and a week before the election it had come out that Hillary's emails had been discovered on her I think her laptop or something I'm, not sure, but Comey had come out and said they were gonna reopen the investigation that she might actually be. You know, have problems. So with this heavily on my mind, I go into the voting booth and every year you every every presidential election. It's like the vote for the president is like the best vote ever so it's like dessert, so you vote for all the people in the voting and then you go back and you vote for the president last and that's what I've always done, because that's like the icing on the cake for voting is voting for the president, but in 2016 I'm standing in the voting, booth and I voted for everybody and I I can't I can't push the vote for Hillary. I can't believe I'm talking about it now, I get emotional, then I'm standing in the voting, booth and I'm looking at the names and all I can think of is what happens if I vote for the first female president and she becomes impeached. I I've been proud of all the people. I voted for I had been completely fooled by Obama I thought he was a good president. I didn't really have any concept of what he had done, certainly didn't know what he did in Benghazi, so I was locked, I just I stood there. I was there for at least five ten minutes voted in Nevada I lived in North Vegas at the time and the guy from the poll thing he came over like you, okay, okay, no I'm, fine, I, I just can't make a decision, he said. Well, you were supposed to make a decision before you got here and I said well, I thought I did, but the problem is when I go to push the button. My brain is like so I stand there. Thinking and I can't make a decision, and then it hits me. You know you're from Vegas and one of the things Vegas teaches you is play the odds. So what are the odds of Hillary getting problems or getting a beach? Well I started. Thinking about all the scandal she's been involved in and I like man, she may not be able to get out of this. One dismissed should be a serious scandal, so I reached over I push the bed in for Trump and in Vegas. Once you push that thing, you can't go back and change it, so I push the butt for Trump and I immediately burst into tears and walked away. I thought that was a lot quite moment. Oh was I wrong, so I leave I, leave the polling place and I'm sick, because I think I've cast a vote against women. I I feel like I. Let down Hillary I feel like I. Let down women it just sitting here. Thinking about that feeling that day it was just awful, it was awful and I was so brainwashed. I was so brainwashed, so I left the voting, booth and I go home and for the first time in my life, I don't watch the election returns because I'm I'm horrified at what I had done I at the time. I push the button in the suit I push the button. I went, oh god, what did you do so? I left I went to bed that night about nine o'clock. I didn't even watch anything the next morning on TV. There was this lady, whose name is Rachel Maddox and I had I know who a Jo Maddox was I. Don't watch TV that much but I wanted to know.

64,5ZAiP9b6_5g,this is my walkaway video I think it's best I give you a little bit of background about how I was brought up and raised I was born in 1977 and south suburban Chicago Cook County and I wasn't really born to a political family at least that I can remember I was born and raised I can't say born I was raised in a Southern Baptist Church and County Mississippi Illinois and I went to church every Sunday with my family and in 1983 my dad had lost his job or got laid off at Republic Steel and he joined the military US Army at 31 years old he was about five years old five or six and so he left you know and pretty much from that point on I didn't have a father in my house so let me tell you from experience I believe truly believe wholeheartedly that that was my downfall as a kid you know and the direction my life was gonna go for the next 20 22 years was obviously because of my choices but I didn't have a man in the house to really beat my ass you know figuratively speaking literally whatever right so I ran all over my mom I did I was a rebel and I was counting down the days until I turned 16 just so I could drop out of high school I absolutely hated school I I didn't really hate to learn it's just I hate it school so I'd say within three years of me dropping out of high school I was in I landed myself in prison I was a drug deal that went bad I got shot three times I shot that guy twice and I got a 9 year prison sentence I'm not blaming anybody but me because I actually know what personal responsibility is so it was all my fault it was my doing but part I played in it and I played major roles in my life I'm the creator of my life I like to think anyway so everything that's ever happened to me good or bad I had to say that I played a part in it you know it was either my bad decision my poor decision-making or maybe I made some good decisions you know along the way so from there and by the way I've always been a drug addict I mean of course not in the past 12 years but the majority of my life I've been a drug addict from smoking weed the first time in 11 or 12 years old shooting heroin shooting methamphetamines smoking crack doing lines of cocaine whatever you name it I pretty much did it and so when I got out of prison I decided to try heroin for the first time I don't know why I decided that probably because I'm an addict mentally in the head and I have an addictive personality or whatever right so I'll tell you what I did here one for six months when I got out of prison and in that six months I lost every piece of anything that I ever had property material things self-worth self-esteem everything right so I ran man I ran from an addiction that at the time I had no idea right that no matter where I went I always took meet with me so I can run anywhere and everywhere possible but I can't outrun myself well that's all I did I jumped on the Greyhound in 2005 January and took it to Southern California I went out I went out there to sell magazines door-to-door write travel the country that's all the end the paper I called it and they they paid for my bus ticket down there and I was now all of a sudden I was in the magazine crew that lasted like a few days I couldn't knock on doors like that I didn't feel right about knocking on doors I didn't feel right about lying to people's faces and telling them this big spiel about just whatever just sticking by some [ __ ] magazines from okay so I quit but then I was in a situation because I quit I was stuck in California and I'm from Illinois I didn't know anybody out there and I had no money so you can imagine why I have a dentist right well I thought myself hopeless and I was in Anaheim the city of Orange Santa on the Santa Ana River bed and it was a homeless community on there still is a homeless community out there its massive actually on that river bed it was pretty big when I was out there too but when I went back out there in 2016 and it's it's just it's massive now there's so many more homeless people out there and there's so many so anyways I stayed on that River been homeless for about a year and a half two years and what got me to change my life around what got me to get clean and clean myself up was guilt and no not white guilt uh I had two kids out there I had a boy and a girl and this was in 2006 and both of their mothers were homeless women as well and I just could not take the guilt my daughter definitely she was born first and then seven days later my son was born but the way my son was born he was born at 20 weeks gestation he was 1 pound 10 ounces positive for methamphetamines and I played a role in that I played a major role in that I couldn't take it it was at that moment that I realized that I was the most selfish self-centered man or sorry excuse for a man that I've ever known you know it was a day of reckoning for me I couldn't take it man I could not take the guilt just couldn't getting explain the amount of guilt how heavy it was right now I can't explain it with word with mere words so I came back home and cleaned myself up you know and since then in 2007 I I landed a pretty good job you know I'm in the Union now and this and that so uh so why I'm walking away I said well I'm walking away right I'm in the Union and the first time I got a letter from the Union suggesting on who I vote for I was happy you know I was just happy to be a part of society and in my head I haven't lived in society at least any kind of a productive member of society I haven't so I was just happy to do it for him you know they negotiate my wages they give me the health insurance I'm gonna vote for who you want me to vote no problem right and I did I voted for Barack Obama without knowing a thing about them I was black and I wanted that actually I wanted the direction of our country to go that way you know and I didn't really check anything else about them I just that's what I wanted so and that's what I got the man ran on a platform of change and we got that so I can't complain about that so the reason I'm walking away and I this time I'm walking away from the Democrat Party who knows a four year or six years 20 22 years ain't no way year is right so in two years I might vote for or I will probably vote for Tom in 2020 and after that I don't know who all before I don't even know the state of our country by that who really knows because it's getting crazy guys it's getting real crazy it's been crazy it's just now all on the surface now it's been like that I can promise you that and I know for a fact it's been like that it's just all been subtle and underneath you know and but my head is crazy this is not the United States that I grew up in this is not the United States and I want my children to grow up in and that's the reason I will never blow the boat blue again I got kids man I've got I've got not just the two I've got three other kids and currently my kids range in age from 3 to 12 and I care about them so I really don't care who the Union tells me to vote for I don't care who's whose hands and whose pockets I'm doing it for my kids I'm doing it for my family because it starts at my house with my kids but let me tell you a little bit a little story though my daughter that was born in 2006 in California Orange County I ended up getting getting custody of her last year in December of 2017 I'll never forget when she first came I've been like from let me just say this I've liked home for a while I didn't really know too much about him but I just know you know I liked him I mean he is like the American dream and I don't really care if he started off borrowing like a million dollars from his dad the man has billions right now of his own money you know I know for a fact I can't do that and if any of you guys can do it more power to you right so anyway my daughter I got custody of her last December she's been with me about 11 months now and when she came in I think Trump was on the news or something like that and she goes like this goes I hate Trump and then she was all for Hillary right and so I'm like why why do you mean Trump who told you that like why exactly do you hate him and why exactly do you hate Hillary well the time she was 11 and I really didn't expect her to know an answer but nonetheless I'm doing this to prove a point or right so fast forward to last Saturday a week ago yeah week ago today Trump was in Murfreesboro Illinois I didn't give my daughter a choice I took her well I took her in my family and I took her for a reason and she was into it you know she was clapping like oh yeah and so after the rally I asked her I said what do you think what do you think oh all that was good it was good I said okay did you hear anything racist by chance coming out of his mouth no that's what she said right my eye well that should tell you something right don't believe everything you hear now I don't really care who my daughter votes for when she gets of age you know as long as she makes her own decisions that's it as long as she hears things with her own ears and makes her own decisions and not based on what everybody's saying right because that's the problem with this country with a lot of people in this country and it may have been my problem - it may be my problem I really don't know sometimes it's hard to see when you're on the inside I'm just I'm upset you know I I don't want our country to go the way it's going I certainly do not want globalism at all I don't want open borders and I'm not sure if these guys think that they're more enlightened than us the the mere peasants we are hope I really don't know but I'm not ready to get my country up like that I am NOT ready to give my country go so go fight for I mean there's more than one way to fight right you fight with your mouth you can fight physically a lot of people are fighting on the internet whatever but I will fight for my country and I will fight for what I believe is right I'll fight for my kids fight for my friends I'll fight for my family I'll fight for the truth I'll fight for what's right open borders is it right in my head from my point of view open borders is not right okay we got enough criminals over here and trust me I do not believe that that whole Caravan is all criminals I don't believe that but I don't believe they're all women and children either I don't believe they're all just people looking for work see I got common sense man I know these people got common sense too so I don't even know why they're trying to lie to people they're trying to lie to us knowing that we know they're lying and I don't get it I don't get it who knows man but I I know this for a fact and I know this from dealing with people in the past my own experience there these people are on a code of silence man they will not come clean period I promise you they won't they won't talk about [ __ ] they won't talk about it I know they won't code of silence man I don't know if you guys get that but I mean what we consider colder silence trust me what they got going is a code of silence they won't talk about [ __ ] they won't you might get one peep out of somebody but they're gonna pay for so anyways that's my walkaway story I mean it's not really a walkaway story I guess it's more about personal responsibility it's about whatever all I know is this country's messed up and I am voting all red oh this midterm for one reason and one reason only it's not for the GOP it's not for the Republicans I do think I have conservative values and let me tell you one other thing about that too right because the the side of the left for me they do have a persuasive argument I mean they do pull it heartstrings right I mean I watch CNN sometimes not because I you know whatever I want to hear what they're talking about I'm tired of hearing sound bites right I need to know what they're talking about and they do pull up my freaking heartstrings man of course man I want to help people I do want to help people that they're in pain or having a rough time I think it's in my nature for them for the most part and so when I'm confused when the waters are muddy I always go back to one thing man I go back to principles principles will guide me the right direction when I'm confused about things or where my heart strings are being pulled I'm against abortion there's one principle I'm pro-life and just because and I've been involved in two abortions in my younger years and have since repented I stand firm on pro-life now and it's not just because I had a vasectomy right I extended fair amount of pro-life what do you want me to do I got five kids come on I'm too old to be having kids oh so it's all about the principles right when the waters get muddy go back to your frickin principles are you pro-life yeah who's pro-choice the left real simple to me real simple so anyways that's my walkaway story I'm probably it probably ends up being just rambling on right song,"This is my walkaway video I. Think it's best I, give you a little bit of background about how I was brought up and raised. I was born in 1977 and south suburban Chicago, Cook, County and I wasn't really born to a political family. At least that I can remember. I was born and raised, I can't say, born I was raised in a Southern Baptist Church and County Mississippi, Illinois and I went to church every Sunday with my family and in 1983 my dad had lost his job or got laid off at Republic Steel, and he joined the military US Army at 31 years old. He was about five years old, five or six, and so he left you know and pretty much from that point on. I didn't have a father in my house, so let me tell you from experience. I believe truly believe wholeheartedly that that was my downfall as a kid you know, and the direction my life was gonna go for the next 20 22 years was obviously because of my choices, but I didn't have a man in the house to really beat my ass. You know figuratively speaking, literally whatever right so I ran all over my mom I did I was a rebel and I was counting down the days until I turned 16. Just so, I could drop out of high school I, absolutely hated school. I I didn't really hate to learn. It's just I hate it school, so I'd say within three years of me: dropping out of high school I was in I landed myself in prison. I was a drug deal that went bad I got shot three times, I shot that guy twice and I got a 9 year. Prison sentence I'm, not blaming anybody, but me because I actually know what personal responsibility is. So it was all my fault. It was my doing, but part I played in it, and I played major roles in my life I'm. The creator of my life I like to think anyway, so everything that's ever happened to me. Good or bad I had to say that I played a part in it. You know it was either my bad decision, my poor decision-making or maybe I made some good decisions. You know along the way so from there and by the way, I've always been a drug addict I mean of course not in the past 12 years, but the majority of my life I've been a drug addict from smoking weed the first time in 11 or 12 years old, shooting heroin, shooting methamphetamines smoking crack doing lines of cocaine whatever you name it I pretty much did it, and so, when I got out of prison, I decided to try heroin for the first time, I, don't know why I decided that, probably because I'm an addict mentally in the head and I have an addictive personality or whatever right so I'll tell you what I did here, one for six months when I got out of prison and in that six months, I lost every piece of anything that I ever had property material things, self-worth, self-esteem, everything right so I ran man. I ran from an addiction that, at the time, I had no idea right. That no matter where I went I always took meet with me. So I can run anywhere and everywhere possible, but I can't outrun myself. Well, that's all I did I jumped on the Greyhound in 2005 January and took it to Southern. California I went out, I went out there to sell magazines, door-to-door write travel, the country, that's all the end. The paper I called it and they they paid for my bus ticket down there and I was now all of a sudden. I was in the magazine, crew that lasted like a few days. I couldn't knock on doors like that. I didn't feel right about knocking on doors. I didn't feel right about lying to people's faces and telling them this big spiel about just whatever just sticking by some [ __ ] magazines from okay, so I quit. But then I was in a situation because I quit I was stuck in California and I'm from Illinois. I didn't know anybody out there and I had no money. So you can imagine why I have a dentist right. Well, I thought myself. Hopeless and I was in Anaheim the city of Orange Santa on the Santa Ana River bed, and it was a homeless community on there still is a homeless community out there, its massive actually on that river bed. It was pretty big when I was out there too, but when I went back out there in 2016, and it's it's just it's massive now, there's so many more homeless people out there and there's so many so anyways I stayed on that River been homeless for about a year and a half two years, and what got me to change my life around? What got me to get clean and clean myself up was guilt and no, not white guilt. Uh I had two kids out there. I had a boy and a girl, and this was in 2006 and both of their mothers were homeless. Women as well and I just could not take the guilt, my daughter definitely she was born first and then, seven days later, my son was born, but the way my son was born. He was born at 20 weeks gestation. He was 1 pound, 10 ounces, positive for methamphetamines and I played a role in that I played a major role in that I couldn't take it. It was at that moment that I realized that I was the most selfish self-centered man or sorry excuse for a man that I've ever known. You know it was a day of reckoning for me. I couldn't take it. Man I could not take the guilt. Just couldn't getting explain the amount of guilt how heavy it was right now. I can't explain it with word with mere words. So I came back home and cleaned myself up, you know and since then, in 2007 I I landed a pretty good job. You know I'm in the Union now and this and that so uh. So why I'm walking away I said well, I'm walking away right I'm in the Union and the first time I got a letter from the Union suggesting on who I vote for I was happy. You know I was just happy to be a part of society and in my head, I haven't lived in society at least any kind of a productive member of society. I haven't so I was just happy to do it for him. You know they negotiate my wages. They give me the health insurance I'm gonna vote, for who you want me to vote. No problem right and I did I voted for Barack Obama without knowing a thing about them. I was black and I, wanted that actually I wanted the direction of our country to go. That way, you know and I didn't really check anything else about them, I, just that's what I wanted so and that's what I got the man ran on a platform of change and we got that so I can't complain about that. So the reason I'm walking away and I this time, I'm walking away from the Democrat Party, who knows a four year or six years, 20 22 years. Ain't no way year is right. So in two years I might vote for or I will probably vote for Tom in 2020 and after that, I don't know who all before I don't even know the state of our country by that who really knows because it's getting crazy guys, it's getting real crazy. It's been crazy, it's just now, all on the surface. Now it's been like that I can promise you that and I know for a fact. It's been like that. It's just all been subtle and underneath you know, and but my head is crazy. This is not the United States that I grew up in this is not the United States and I want my children to grow up in and that's the reason I will never blow the boat blue. Again I got kids man I've got I've got not just the two I've got three other kids, and currently my kids range in age, from 3 to 12 and I care about them. So I really don't care who the Union tells me to vote for I, don't care who's whose hands and whose pockets I'm doing it for my kids, I'm doing it for my family because it starts at my house with my kids. But let me tell you a little bit a little story, though my daughter that was born in 2006 in California, Orange County I ended up getting getting custody of her last year in December of 2017 I'll, never forget when she first came I've been like from. Let me just say this I've liked home for a while. I didn't really know too much about him, but I just know. You know I liked him. I mean he is like the American dream and I don't really care if he started off borrowing like a million dollars from his dad. The man has billions right now of his own money. You know, I know for a fact. I can't do that and if any of you guys can do it more power to you right so anyway, my daughter I got custody of her last December she's been with me about 11 months now and when she came in I. Think Trump was on the news or something like that and she goes like this goes: I hate, Trump and then she was all for Hillary right and so I'm like why? Why do you mean Trump who told you that like? Why exactly do you hate him and why exactly do you hate, Hillary? Well, the time she was 11 and I really didn't expect her to know an answer, but nonetheless I'm doing this to prove a point or right so fast forward to last Saturday. A week ago, yeah week ago, today, Trump was in Murfreesboro Illinois I didn't give my daughter a choice. I took her well, I took her in my family and I took her for a reason and she was into it. You know she was clapping like oh yeah, and so after the rally I asked her I said: what do you think? What do you think? Oh all, that was good. It was good. I said: okay, did you hear anything racist by chance coming out of his mouth? No, that's what she said right my eye. Well, that should tell you something right, don't believe everything you hear now, I, don't really care who my daughter votes for when she gets of age. You know as long as she makes her own decisions, that's it as long as she hears things with her own ears and makes her own decisions and not based on what everybody's saying right, because that's the problem with this country with a lot of people in this country- and it may have been my problem -. It may be my problem. I really don't know. Sometimes it's hard to see when you're on the inside I'm just I'm upset. You know, I I, don't want our country to go the way it's going. I certainly do not want globalism at all. I, don't want open borders and I'm not sure if these guys think that they're more enlightened than us, the the mere peasants we are hope, I really don't know, but I'm not ready to get my country up like that. I am NOT ready to give my country go so go fight for I mean there's more than one way to fight right. You fight with your mouth. You can fight physically. A lot of people are fighting on the internet whatever, but I will fight for my country and I will fight for what I believe is right. I'll fight for my kids fight for my friends, I'll fight for my family, I'll fight for the truth, I'll fight for what's right, open borders. Is it right in my head from my point of view: open borders is not right. Okay, we got enough criminals over here and trust me. I. Do not believe that that whole Caravan is all criminals I, don't believe that, but I, don't believe they're all women and children either I, don't believe they're, all just people looking for work, see I got common sense. Man I know these people got common sense too. So I don't even know why they're trying to lie to people they're trying to lie to us, knowing that we know they're, lying and I, don't get it I, don't get it. Who knows man, but I. I know this for a fact and I know this from dealing with people in the past. My own experience there. These people are on a code of silence man. They will not come clean period, I promise you they won't. They won't talk about [, __ ]. They won't talk about it. I know they won't code of silence. Man I, don't know if you guys get that, but I mean what we consider colder silence. Trust me. What they got going is a code of silence. They won't talk about [, __ ]. They won't. You might get one peep out of somebody, but they're gonna pay for so anyways. That's my walkaway story. I mean it's not really a walkaway story. I! Guess it's more about personal responsibility. It's about whatever all I know is this country's messed up and I am voting all red. Oh, this midterm for one reason, and one reason only it's not for the GOP, it's not for the Republicans I do think. I have conservative values, and let me tell you one other thing about that too right, because the the side of the left for me, they do have a persuasive argument. I mean they do pull it. Heartstrings right, I mean I watch CNN, sometimes not because I. You know whatever I want to hear what they're talking about I'm tired of hearing sound bites right, I need to know what they're talking about and they do pull up. My freaking heartstrings man. Of course, man I, want to help people I do want to help people that they're in pain or having a rough time. I think it's in my nature for them for the most part, and so when I'm confused when the waters are muddy, I always go back to one thing: man I go back to principles. Principles will guide me the right direction when I'm confused about things or where my heart strings are being pulled. I'm against abortion, there's one principle: I'm pro-life and just because and I've been involved in two abortions in my younger years and have since repented I, stand firm on pro-life now and it's not just because I had a vasectomy right, I extended fair amount of pro-life. What do you want me to do? I got five kids come on I'm, too old to be having kids, oh. So it's all about the principles right when the waters get muddy. Go back to your frickin principles. Are you pro-life yeah who's pro-choice? The left real, simple to me, real, simple! So anyways, that's my walkaway story. I'm! Probably it probably ends up being just rambling on right song."

It's a nice woodsy area and I'm just enjoying a nice August afternoon, while I'm sitting here I was thinking about why I walked away from the Democratic Party. So here's my story, my mom and dad were Republicans, but they raised me to vote my conscience and oftentimes. We would vote Democrat. Sometimes we disagree. I voted for Carter, but I also voted for Nixon I voted for Reagan, but I also voted for Clinton and Obama both twice. What changed me into a Democrat basically was the invasion of Iraq I really thought that was unnecessary and I blamed george w bush for all those lives lost and money spent, so I switched to the Democratic Party thinking that their ideals were better now I've always been a supporter of the Second Amendment. Even when I was a flaming, liberal and I've always been conservative on some things, but for the most part, I took all the liberal policies to heart and when the 2016 election came around I was definitely a Bernie bro I. Never liked Hillary I never liked her when she was a first lady I didn't have a lot of faith in their truth-telling abilities, but at the time I didn't really care whether Clinton had an affair or not, because the country was in good shape financially. I have since changed on that. I am really really upset about the fact that I ever voted for him or Obama. The Obama was such a disappointment to me, but getting back to why I walked away from the Democratic Party in 2016, like I said I was a Bernie. Bro I was all about the free college. The free health care, the flee this, the free that and I had slowly been indoctrinated or, let's say brainwashed into believing that all the ills of the earth or because of the rich. So when the DNC and Hillary basically gave Bernie the screw job that they did, my eyes began to open now. I might also have mentioned that I had moved from Florida, which is a liberal haven to the North Georgia Mountains in 2012. So I had plenty of conservative friends and I fought with them, often about my ideals versus their ideals. They were always always respectful kind and treated me as a human, even though my views were radically different from their conservative years now. I can't say that about my liberal friends, because I had several on Facebook and even in personal life, when my beliefs began to evolve and when it finally culminated with me switching allegiances from Democratic to Republican or liberal to conservative I lost no less than 15 friends. Why? Because they're intolerant they are unable to see another point of view. They are mean they said horrible things to me. They are angry. They are eight full. Will you restate that they are hateful I, never had one conservative friend ever unfriend me or treat me with disrespect, because I believed and all the birdy bro bull or the Obama bull, but the Liberals dude? Oh, they jumped on me with both jackboots. So in 2016, I voted for President, Donald, J Trump I have to admit that at first it was because I was just pissed about the way the Democratic Party operated, but I. Also like the things that he was saying. I didn't believe that it was going to be possible or that he was going to do the things that he said he was going to do because most politicians in my experience have not, but he did, he has tried or fulfilled every single promise that he made to us on the campaign trail and we are reaping the rewards reaping the rewards. So here's my walkaway moment it happened in 2016, but I'm just telling you about it now in 2018, I am so pleased to see there. People other than myself are waking up to the liberal lies and the harassment they're. The left puts forth Sogo Trump vote. Conservative and I walked away Thomas Davis from the North Georgia Mountains. You."
66,6q8I9CpV-S0,my name is Michael and I want to thank my wife for encouraging me to make this video you may have heard of her video last night her name's Libby and I really want to thank Brandon for what he did by giving her an opportunity to speak to a larger audience so I think for me I actually walked away long before I even knew that's what I was doing it probably started long back when I started getting heavily involved with documentaries and starting to understand how corrupt big government was and how it made a lot more sense for government to be smaller at the time I thought the solution to that was Democrats and I was silly enough to vote for Obama twice honestly not knowing much about policy but thinking it made sense to give everybody healthcare and I've certainly been for example pro-choice my entire life I'd still tell you I am but I certainly understand why states want to have much stricter pro-life laws and I do think there's a lot of hypocrisy out there especially with maybe let's say the current immigration system with people that are also ok with babies dying maybe a week or two before they could be born or actually maybe even after they could potentially be born and live so there's that but now yeah I mean I I take time I research pretty much everything I look at both sides it's pretty funny the hate and the vitriol that I receive I do not attack people I do not even attack really what people say I do my best to think about maybe their perspective I think Jordan Peterson's 12 rules is a fantastic book and I think you got to get your own house in order first and I think I have to take the time to understand somebody else's perspective and make sure I'm not attacking somebody else if what I'm asking for is the Democrats and liberals not to be attacking us but I will say as much as I disagree with let's say for example a guy like Sam Harris on his his opinion with Trump he clearly has a pretty good idea of how bad the left is as compared to the right when it comes to individual freedoms and that's really probably the most important thing to me so I mean there's so much to talk about and my wife can tell you I can pretty much talk forever but I at least wanted to share a little bit of my story I'm not even sure if I'm really a conservative I think reading a lot of discussion on Libby's post and on Brandon's post last night maybe I'm an old school liberal who's actually a center-right conservative nowadays I mean I'm certainly not religious although having two children now I almost would like to find religion I grew up Jewish but I was heavily criticized by people and a very heavily Jewish City which is kind of strange but yeah so I really hate bigotry and there's so many people in my family that literally are being bigots and don't understand that that's what they're being and then are upset for being called bigots although I'm no longer calling anybody bigots this was probably six months ago when I was unfriended by my cousin and my uncle which is kind of hurtful I can't believe it my uncle is one of the most free thinkers I thought he was at least and it's hard for me to understand why he would have unfriended me just because I was posting factual articles on one of his posts and he insisted that it was not factual so that's my story and I hope more people do post videos III see more of a red wave than a blue wave in upcoming political elections which will hopefully continue our country on a much greater trajectory so I would say leave you with one last thought we should all agree that it would make a lot of sense to make America great again my name is Michael and I want to thank my wife for encouraging me to make this video you may have heard of her video last night her name's Libby and I really want

67,76Mj6tMNiBw,so my kids said hey mom can you at least brush your hair and put some makeup on if you're gonna make a video for a bunch of strangers and I thought no I'm keeping it real they're gonna get to know me really well right now so I might as well show them what I look like right so walking away walking away from me has been an increment it's been baby steps it's been evolutionary and I didn't just walk away I walked away a while ago just to give you some background I am a latina born and raised in the boogie down bronx my dad's boricua Puerto Rican and my mom is a legal resident a legal immigrant from Belize and between her my dad I think they raised for pretty amazing children my brothers are both United States Marine Corps veterans and they both served in Desert Storm my sister's an accountant and she is a 9/11 survivor she worked on the 90 floor of the first tower that got hit and I survived running the streets in the Bronx so I guess my first big disagreement when my dad was when I turned 18 this was a while ago I'm 43 years old and so the first president that I ever voted for was Bill Clinton and my dad schooled me he did he said that I was being brainwashed by the media and that I was allowing myself to vote for someone who was no good but just because he was young and hip and I denied it I denied it to the core but um he was right you know I saw Bill Clinton on MTV and he had smoked but didn't inhale so I thought that was pretty cool what a shallow reason to vote for someone right so anyhow let me give you some background on my parents they're both pretty conservative Christians but I believe that they're beautiful Christians they're what Christianity should be I vote in the 90s and I had transvestites come to my house with their big shoes and a big hair and their psychedelic clothes because the light was groove is in the heart was a and you know my parents have come in the room do you guys need anything those are my parents my sister's best friend was a game man during the 1980s and he had AIDS and his family did not want him it was taboo to be a gay man in the 80s dying of AIDS but my parents took him in and he died in my home and those are the people who raised me beautiful conservative people with a big open heart but even with that solid foundation I let the osmosis of New York City seep into me and mold my thinking you know and I thank God for my parents because I think it is that true foundation that allowed me to seek truth and finally get to where I'm at I turn back to my roots but in the middle of all that I lived the liberal life I worked in the music industry I was the manager of the first hip-hop label label on fever records and fever nightclub and I lived a pretty liberal lifestyle and a lot of my choices were liberal and you know it was one of those knuckleheads that thought I would never personally have an abortion but it's okay if you do and and just ah it just supported Planned Parenthood and just uh just a totally different person than Who I am so they 43 year old mother five beautiful children conservative living in a different state in the suburbs and seeing things completely different I guess I started walking away when one of my brothers was diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome and he got it from the inoculations that he received in the Marine Corps it made me start researching and I

you're gonna make a video for a bunch of strangers and I thought no I'm, keeping it real they're gonna get to know me really well right now, so I might as well show them. What I look like right, so walking away walking away from me has been an increment. It's been baby steps, it's been evolutionary and I didn't just walk away. I walked away a while ago. Just to give you some background. I am a latina born and raised in the boogie down bronx my dad's boricua Puerto Rican and my mom is a legal resident, a legal immigrant from Belize and between her my dad I think they raised for pretty amazing children. My brothers are both United States Marine Corps veterans, and they both served in Desert Storm, my sister's an accountant, and she is a 9/11 survivor. She worked on the 90 floor of the first tower that got hit and I survived running the streets in the Bronx, so I guess my first big disagreement. When my dad was when I turned 18, this was a while ago, I'm 43 years old, and so the first president that I ever voted for was Bill Clinton and my dad schooled me. He did. He said that I was being brainwashed by the media and that I was allowing myself to vote for someone who was no good, but just because he was young and hip and I denied it. I denied it to the core, but um he was right. You know, I saw Bill Clinton on MTV and he had smoked but didn't inhale. So I thought that was pretty cool. What a shallow reason to vote for someone right. So anyhow, let me give you some background on my parents: they're both pretty conservative Christians but I believe that they're beautiful Christians they're what Christianity should be I vote in the 90s and I had transvestites come to my house with their big shoes and a big hair and their psychedelic clothes, because the light was groove is in the heart was a and you know my parents have come in the room. Do you guys need anything? Those are my parents, my sister's best friend was a game man during the 1980s and he had AIDS and his family did not want him. It was taboo to be a gay man in the 80s dying of AIDS, but my parents took him in and he died in my home and those are the people who raised me: beautiful conservative people with a big open heart, but even with that solid foundation, I let the osmosis of New York City seep into me and mold. My thinking, you know and I thank God for my parents, because I think it is that true foundation that allowed me to seek truth and finally get to where I'm at I turn back to my roots. But in the middle of all that I lived, the liberal life I worked in the music industry. I was the manager of the first hip-hop label label on fever, records and fever. Nightclub and I lived a pretty liberal lifestyle and a lot of my choices were liberal, and you know it was one of those knuckleheads that thought I would never personally have an abortion, but it's okay. If you do, and and just ah it just supported, Planned Parenthood and just uh, just a totally different person than Who I am so they 43 year old, mother, five, beautiful children, conservative living in a different state in the suburbs and seeing things completely different, I guess: I started walking away when one of my brothers was diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome and he got it from the inoculations that he received in the Marine Corps. It made me start researching and I realized that the president who I voted in Bill Clinton signed the executive order. 131 39, the basic D renders a military guinea-pigs. The governments allow to do whatever they want without informed consent on our military and it's okay. Because of that executive order, and so that was my first mm-hmm and then my second son was injured by the MMR vaccine. He swelled three times the size. He got his first asthma attack and he broke out in a rash from head to toe and was inconsolable, but because a military doctor told me that it could never be the vaccines and I was so trusting of governmental officials. That I believed him and I continued to vaccinate. My children and my son was injured a second time and this time it was undeniable. He had an anaphylactic reaction to the MMR vaccine and he stopped breathing and that really opened my eyes and it took me through a rabbit hole where the ending is basically hell and then 9/11 happened and my sister survived. But it made me really question things because our world was changing. Homeland Security was started. The airport was like going through Rikers Island, you know prison, it was just awful and even early on some people would whispering and saying that it might be an inside job and I didn't believe that. But three years later someone handed me a VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jones, and this nutjob made a lot of sense and planted some seeds, and so I walked away a little more slowly. I started to question things and I think that at that point, I registered myself as a Republican, but guess what my research took me so far down the rabbit hole. That I then decided to go party less and decided to just vote. People on merit and I kept switching back and forth between both parties, depending on who I thought I wanted to vote in and even then even then that I thought I was awake. I really wasn't guys really really wasn't it's been evolutionary and it's been a lot of research and a lot of opening and expanding of my mind and the reason why I explained to you. My background is because I think it took the sort of home that I grew up in where everyone was welcome. Teen moms were pregnant. You know, black white Chinese has mine, you know, Dominican I mean it was a melting pot in my parents, home they took in the people who were unwanted by some and raise children who were abandoned by the parents. I think it took this sort of background to keep me open-minded and to make me research and really start questioning things, because I realized that the media was playing us, that everything was connected. The president, the agendas, you know my son's injury, my brother's injury, researching health and vaccines and and seeing that some states have made it mandatory for children to be vaccinated in order to go to school. If something is so good for you, why do you have to mandate it and I? Don't want to start a debate here, I'm all about choice, I'm all about informing people and giving them choice, and the thing is that no one informed me when I was a young mom. Even when I questioned that it told me it was safe and effective and I guess all those things: health, the pharmaceutical industry, the politics celebrities because being coming from a world where I worked in a world of celebrities, hip-hop singers and then I switched over to the Latin scene and I know I'm, not gonna mention it. But I worked for some really big. Latin artists, ha's and I got to see that world too, and in my research I realized that it's all connected the leads. The Cabal, CPS vaccines, pharmaceuticals, money, greed, I mean it's a big rabbit hole and the thing is Society. You know we're normal working people a lot of us. You know I'm blessed to be a stay-at-home mom. My you know my husband works and we have a beautiful home and I get to stay home with our children. We sacrificed a lot so I don't want anyone to think that I'm privileged I've been called a privileged white person when I'm not white. Second I'm, not privileged. My husband and I have busted our behind, so everything that we have and we sacrifice a lot but I lost my train of thought, but my thought I think I was going with a lot of people, um Oh division. The media tries to play us and divide us and people who meet me now and see me as a conservative. Christian stay home, mom homeschooling, mama five. They automatically assume things about me. They think that I'm hateful that I'm homophobic, that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. You know it's so ridiculous and knowing my roots, knowing that I was born and raised in the Bronx by two hard-working people, knowing the type of home that I came from it kind of pisses me off that people assume that I'm privileged, but I guess what I want people to take away from this is that the first step so walking away is educating yourself whatever it took to open your eyes, tap in on that and delve into other realms, because you will see that it's all connected and a lot of what we've been told are lies a lot of it. I have a background in the medical industry I'm a lactation consultant, I worked for the Health, Department I went to nursing school and what I realized is that Big Pharma has their dirty little hands and a lot of things in textbooks and what we're taught they support wings and hospitals. If there's money there's a possibility of getting in there. This is how formula companies were able to get their formulas into goodie bags that are handed out to new parents. Everything everything has a purpose. Everything is done for a purpose and I guess, but I want people to take away from this. Is that if a kid from the Bronx who grew up and was raised in the ghetto can get out, can open and expand her mind and can see things for what they really are. So can you so can you we can all do it and we don't have to love each other's choices and we don't have to agree on everything, but we can love one another as human beings and we could come to common ground and we could work together to bring a beautiful and brighter future for all. That's the thing we don't have to be divided. Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean that I agree with everything he says: I, don't follow. Anyone blind me just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean that I'm privileged just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean I'm, homophobic, um, I have gay cousins who I love, I grew up, voguing and I had I grew up with a gay man living in my home. You know like just because we are certain things doesn't define the whole of us as a person, so I guess my video is that we can all come from different walks, different views and still walk away and still hold our hands together and still fight for good. If a good country god bless, my children follow me. So my kids said: hey mom. Can you at least brush your hair and put some makeup on if you're gonna make a video for a bunch of strangers and I thought no I'm, keeping it real, they're gonna get to know me really well right now, so I might as well show them what I look like right, so walking away walking away from me has been an increment. It's been baby steps, it's been evolutionary and I didn't just walk away. I walked away a while ago. Just to give you some background. I am a latina born and raised in the boogie down bronx my dad's boricua Puerto Rican and my mom is a legal resident, a legal immigrant from Belize and between her my dad I think they raised for pretty amazing children. My brothers are both United States Marine Corps veterans and they both served in Desert Storm, my sister's an accountant, and she is a 9/11 survivor. She worked on the 90 floor of the first tower that got hit and I survived running the streets in the Bronx, so I guess my first big disagreement. When my dad was when I turned 18. This was a while ago, I'm 43 years old, and so the first president that I ever voted for was Bill Clinton and my dad schooled me. He did. He said that I was being brainwashed by the media and that I was allowing myself to vote for someone who was no good, but just because he was young and hip and I denied it I denied it to the core, but um. He was right. You know, I saw Bill Clinton on MTV and he had smoked but didn't inhale. So I thought that was pretty cool. What a shallow reason to vote for someone right. So anyhow, let me give you some background on my parents: they're both pretty conservative Christians but I believe that they're beautiful Christians they're. What Christianity should be I vote in the 90s and I had transvestites come to my house with their big shoes and a big hair and their psychedelic clothes, because the light was groove is in the heart was a and you know my parents have come in the room. Do you guys need anything? Those are my parents. My sister's best friend was a game man during the 1980s and he had AIDS and his family did not want him. It was taboo to be a gay man in the 80s dying of AIDS, but my parents took him in and he died in my home and those are the people who raised me: beautiful conservative people with a big open heart, but even with that solid foundation, I let the osmosis of New York City seep into me and mold. My thinking, you know and I thank God for my parents, because I think it is that true foundation that allowed me to seek truth and finally get to where I'm at I turn back to my roots. But in the middle of all that I lived, the liberal life I worked in the music industry. I was the manager of the first hip-hop label label on fever, records and fever. Nightclub and I lived a pretty liberal lifestyle and a lot of my choices were liberal, and you know it was one of those knuckleheads that thought I would never personally have an abortion, but it's okay, if you do and and just ah it just supported, Planned Parenthood and just uh, just a totally different person than Who I am so they 43 year old, mother, five, beautiful children, conservative living in a different state in the suburbs and seeing things completely different, I guess: I started walking away when one of my brothers was diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome and he got it from the inoculations that he received in the Marine Corps. It made me start researching and I realized that the president who I voted in Bill Clinton signed the executive order. 131 39 the basic D renders a military guinea-pigs. The governments allow to do whatever they want without informed consent on our military and it's okay. Because of that executive order- and so that was my first mm-hmm and then my second son was injured by the MMR vaccine, he swelled three times the size. He got his first asthma attack and he broke out in a rash from head to toe and was inconsolable, but because a military doctor told me that it could never be the vaccines and I was so trusting of governmental officials. That I believed him and I continued to vaccinate. My children and my son was injured a second time, and this time it was undeniable. He had an anaphylactic reaction to the MMR vaccine and he stopped breathing and that really opened my eyes and it took me through a rabbit hole where the ending is basically hell and then 9/11 happened and my sister survived. But it made me really question things because our world was changing. Homeland Security was started. The airport was like going through, Rikers Island, you know prison, it was just awful and even early on some people would whispering and saying that it might be an inside job and I didn't believe that. But three years later someone handed me a VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jones, and this nutjob made a lot of sense and planted some seeds, and so I walked away a little more slowly. I started to question things and I think that at that point, I registered myself as a Republican, but guess what my research took me so far down the rabbit hole that I then decided to go party less and decided to just vote. People on merit and I kept switching back and forth between both parties, depending on who I thought, I wanted to vote in and even then even then that I thought I was awake. I really wasn't guys really really wasn't it's been evolutionary and it's been a lot of research and a lot of opening and expanding of my mind and the reason why I explained to you. My background is because I think it took the sort of home that I grew up in where everyone was welcome. Teen moms were pregnant. You know black white Chinese has mine, you know, Dominican I mean it was a melting pot in my parents, home they took in the people who were unwanted by some and raise children who were abandoned by the parents. I think it took this sort of background to keep me open-minded and to make me research and really start questioning things, because I realized that the media was playing us, that everything was connected. The president, the agendas you know my son's injury, my brother's injury, researching health and vaccines and and seeing that some states have made it mandatory for children to be vaccinated in order to go to school. If something is so good for you, why do you have to mandate it and I? Don't want to start a debate here, I'm all about choice, I'm all about informing people and giving them choice, and the thing is that no one informed me when I was a young mom. Even when I questioned that it told me it was safe and effective and I guess all those things: health, the pharmaceutical industry, the politics celebrities because being coming from a world where I worked in a world of celebrities, hip-hop singers and then I switched over to the Latin scene and I know I'm, not gonna mention it.

Hopefully it still recording a replay later because I know I, don't know how many people jump on this livestream, but um. What I want to do is just do a quick statement of my walkaway story, really quick, because I did one on YouTube that I wanted to upload to this page, but it was not only was very long, but uh I kind of was using a lot of curse. Words. I was very uh emotional, doing the video for YouTube for my walk away story. So what I want to say right, quick is uh I'm, so proud of our president right now, I'm watching the rally in Texas and every time I see him talk -. This man is amazing, I'm, so proud and I'm, so glad that I actually voted for him. So rewinding back I almost didn't vote for Donald Trump I was uh. I guess I had kind of like that democratic insanity that are the Democrats are full of poor Republicans. Look for the rich, that's always how it is. If you're not educated into politics, well- or you don't do your research well, you're gonna know that um. Are you gonna think that that's how things are in politics that the Democrats are going to be for the poor people for the people and that Republicans are for the rich? They don't do good for the poor and I. Don't have to tell you guys, I'll be preaching to the choir. You guys know already you guys running this campaign. You walked away and you guys know everything it is to know, because you guys have done your research and that's the reason why you guys are here. You've, awoken, you've took in the red pill and another thing that I'm so proud of. Is this page the walk away campaign page so many people that I see man is every day I see a new story and I see a Hispanics. You know my people on Colombian some adoring dissent for my parents. I was born in California I'm here in Miami right now, representing Miami, born born in California, raise my hand and I see so many people uploading their walkaway campaign, videos and lesbians, gay men, gay women, black Americans. All these people waking up and realizing how bad the Democratic Party is and how they're destroying our country. What they're doing is it's incredible, I mean um, I, think that's just their plan and a lot of them are just pawns. Maybe they don't know better they're just being uh, they think they're doing the right thing, some of them and they're just being controlled. Of course, we all know by who- and some are just doing it because of the money and what's offered to them, because there's a very powerful man behind the curtain pulling the strings controlling everything and, of course, that's mr. George Soros, very wealthy man and he's actually the one that uh is funding all this crap, going on with the caravan of uh, mostly Honduran, people which I have nothing against renderings. But it's just a lot of them. Are pawns they've been paid to come over here and a lot of them, unfortunately, are not the best of what Honduras has to offer, because they're coming all this way with a violent mentality that they want to force their ways in here and it's not gonna happen, we're not gonna, let it happen, hopefully uh the Mexican government curbs training. So anyways back to my my story. I guess you could say since I was a teenager, I started Democrats were were for the for the poor. I got educated uh more into the truth. The red pill, if you will by a friend of mine that when the election started coming up actually so unbelievable, actually was considering voting for a new Clinton um. He kidded me on uh what he told me about these key things about her and key things about Donald Trump. So a lot of things I was like knives can't be. This can't be real, so I started researching myself and once I found all the information I needed to find from all the researching I found out that a lot of these things were true and I thought. My really good research, because I wanted to make sure that these things that my friend was telling me were real and I. You know that's how I was woke if you say: oh okay, pop the red pill and um Gina found out that uh came and came to find out that most of the Democratic Party are just not gonna. Do good for the country and their agenda is just not any good here in Miami I. You can't walk around with the Trump shirt too much because you're asking for for your action for problems and that it shouldn't be like that. If I see somebody walking around with uh or somebody with a bumper sticker that says Hillary Clinton on it or Wulfric Hillary, whatever it was, they had. You know a bumper sticker. They have represented Democrats. That doesn't click in my mind, all [ __ ]. Let me screw up this guy's car or enemy uh beat this guy up that doesn't pop in our head, because we're rational people and most Republicans are like Democrats. They have this I, don't know - like this mentality of not hearing out the other side and just want to into violence you're here in Miami. You know we do have a lot of red supporters. You know you show it and it's gonna be problems just like the thing that happened in the Cheesecake Factory here by by where I live, close to violet and Dale, and the gentleman was wearing a trump hat and he got attacked by people that work in the restaurant. That's pathetic, so um I'm not gonna, make this video any longer. Hopefully we'll stay on there so show later, and people watch it. I was awoken in the last campaign, got to vote for Trump I'm, proud of that I'm, proud of our country. I'm, proud of everybody in this walk away campaign. Every time I see a video here, I, don't like it, I love it all of you guys from gays. My my brothers and black Americans, my Hispanic brothers, I'm, proud of all you guys, man taking that pill and waking up to the truth. It all it takes is knowledge, digging research and that's how you guys will find out that you're on the right team and we're gonna change this country again, man and I'm praying that we were able to change it because it's for the better of everybody, like I, said, walk away. My name is George. You guys have a great day appreciate it. You what's up everybody out there I want to make a quick livestream with you guys over here at the walkway campaign.

69,7Nlgt4eZ_q0,hi my name is leonie and i am a walk away i have been a walk away since july of 2018 when i found the group on july 4th but i have never made a video before i am making it today because i know there must be other people out there who need who are feeling and going through what i am and need to know their other people like you so i was brought up in a family that was jewish and democrat and we didn't even think about it i never questioned my political affiliations i thought that being a democrat was part of me being a jew and i thought the two of them fit really nicely together the liberal values and the jewish values fit together so nicely these views started to get challenged when in 2005 when i met a man who later became my husband who began to question and began to have debates with me about some of my values and what i realized was that our values were very we wanted the same end point but he would go around the circle one way and i would go around the circle the other way so my mind was starting to be opened but in 2008 i happily voted for barack obama it was during the barack obama presidency that i started to question and realize i really wasn't a democrat i think what really started me questioning was his views about israel something that is very important to me and i began to realize that this didn't he did not speak for who i was so i started to question it and i realized in 2011 that i did not have anywhere to go i wasn't a democrat anymore i wasn't a republican i didn't know what i was i was stuck in that limbo land in the middle so in 2012 i voted libertarian because that was what fit best with who i was and through 2012 to 2016 there was i voted some republicans some democrat a little bit of this little bit of that but i knew there was nobody i believe there was no one else who was like me in two so when i found walkaway i was so happy because suddenly there were other people that were like me they weren't democrats anymore and they weren't exactly sure where they were so what made me do this video tonight is i had a discussion with my mother about politics which is always a bad thing because it started with her telling me that dan bongino had made some comments about all democrats being awful or something and that no republican know that republicans do that but democrats don't so we had a 30-minute argument where i was trying to convince her of that whatever but what i realized is there is no one in my family that i can talk politics with so i know that walkaway is the space where i can vent and i can be so thank you walk away for being there and hopefully this video will help somebody else have a good day,"Hi, my name is leonie and I am a walk away. I have been a walk away since july of 2018 when I found the group on july 4th, but I have never made a video before I am making it today, because I know there must be other people out there who need who are feeling and going through what I am and need to know their other people like you. So I was brought up in a family that was jewish and democrat and we didn't even think about it. I never questioned my political affiliations. I thought that being a democrat was part of me being a jew and I thought the two of them fit really nicely together. The liberal values and the jewish values fit together so nicely. These views started to get challenged when in 2005, when I met a man who later became my husband who began to question and began to have debates with me about some of my values and what I realized was that our values were very. We wanted the same end point, but he would go around the circle one way and I would go around the circle. The other way, so my mind was starting to be opened, but in 2008 I happily voted for barack obama. It was during the barack obama presidency that I started to question and realize I really wasn't a democrat. I think what really started me questioning was his views about israel, something that is very important to me and I began to realize that this didn't. He did not speak for who I was so. I started to question it and I realized in 2011 that I did not have anywhere to go. I wasn't a democrat anymore. I wasn't a republican, I didn't know what I was. I was stuck in that limbo land in the middle, so in 2012 I voted libertarian, because that was what fit best with who I was and through 2012 to 2016. There was. I voted some republicans some democrat a little bit of this little bit of that, but I knew there was nobody. I believe there was no one else who was like me in two. So when I found walkaway I was so happy because suddenly there were other people that were like me: they weren't democrats anymore and they weren't exactly sure where they were. So what made me do this video tonight is? I had a discussion with my mother about politics, which is always a bad thing, because it started with her telling me that dan bongino had made some comments about all democrats being awful or something, and that no republican know that republicans do that. But democrats don't so we had a 30-minute argument where I was trying to convince her of that whatever. But what I realized is. There is no one in my family that I can talk politics with, so I know that walkaway is the space where I can vent and I can be so. Thank you walk away for being there, and hopefully this video will help. Somebody else have a good day."
70,7OGv5BD9854,hi everybody I'm a little nervous so please bear with me as I sort of stumble stumble my way through this story I've never told this story in public so you guys are the first to hear the story now most of my friends now who know me here in 2018 it's pretty public knowledge that I am a socially conservative economic libertarian who supports the military but doesn't want to do nation-building I guess that's where I am politically I am not registered in any party I have never campaigned for any candidate very politically active and informed but registered independent that's kind of where I am and for my friends who know me in this way most of them have no idea how radical and wacky I was as a young adult and I guess I wanted to talk about how young people get sucked into really radical ideology and what shook me out of it so for me my story it began for me basically in my childhood because I grew up in very extreme poverty my parents were pretty much the epitome of white trash and I'm not saying that in a condemning kind of way at all they they know this they were doing the best they could it just was what it was but we were in pretty extreme poverty and for me as a child living in that world I was bullied quite a bit I really didn't have any friends and judging from the grown-ups in my family I didn't have a whole lot to look forward to so I wanted something better and I was searching for kind of a way to get out of that ditch and when you live in that environment the only political social option there is is the Democrat Party when I was young it was made clear to me in no uncertain terms the Republican Party is a private club for millionaires and they made their fortune by unscrupulous means just period we didn't know any Republicans never met a millionaire in our life but we were quite sure that all of them were unscrupulous and they had their own private club so for me to get involved in any kind of social justice or whatever I was nudged to the left by default so you kind of you start down this road wanting happiness love and fairness and for everybody to be happy and having a food that that's why you start down the road but somewhere in the process it starts getting ugly and usually what happens is you begin wanting tolerance wanting inclusion but all of a sudden as you go you start looking for excuses to disqualify people and that's always step one and it's never anything personal it's always about a philosophy or a policy or a social demographic that's what it is everything is cast in terms of abstract demographics institutions it's never personal it's always demographic so you start off down this road and you start disqualifying well why should I bother defending millionaires millionaire Republicans what do they need me for and that's the little sleight of hand I'm defending the little guy what do they need my help for they don't need me defending them now they they're getting along without me they don't care about me I'm never gonna meet them they're never gonna notice if I hate them or not so what difference does it make so they're disqualified I'm not a social justice campaign for everyone with them and then you start moving a little further and then you say oh you know I'm going to disqualify those successful people with a nuclear family you know they're disqualified because they don't understand what the struggle is and they're probably all just cheating on their spouses and hypocrites anyways and they don't need my help so they'll never notice if I hate them so they're disqualified and then you go down a little further and then you pick off someone else and then you pick off someone else and next thing you know you're marching down this road let's get more and more narrow and it's never a personal thing about the lady sitting next to you it's always abstract and at the time that I was getting into this I was really hoping like okay this is this is like how will you bring about social justice this is how you make things better and years would go by and elections would happen and we would have this governor that governor and nothing was ever changing and I wasn't seeing any good out of this and you know you would hear people say you know the Democrats are morally bankrupt and the left is an empty ideology you would hear these things but it couldn't be true right because you're investing all of your energy into this fight for the cause and it can't be an empty ideology so then you're searching for the meaning behind it so then you're going further and further into the the thoughts and the thought leaders behind this leftist ideology and you're going further and further down the road and it's getting more and more narrow so then by the time that I was in high school I hooked up with this whole group of friends who were really far left I mean we were doing some pretty radical stuff we actually had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook I'm not kidding I remember writing papers in school in defense of domestic terrorism my friends and I mean they were they dabbled in witchcraft they dabbled in sexual perversion experimenting they dabbled in reading nihilistic philosophers I mean this was the world that I lived in pretty much day in and day out like those were my friends that was my social scene I actually remember being in high school and starting a petition against my high school newspaper because I thought it had a Christian bias I seriously did remember doing that that's just kind of a few examples of the world that I was living in and you're going down this road and you're just bypassing everything that is common sense everything that is rational everything that makes society stay together and I didn't even realize that I was being systemic ly divorced from the normal human experience that's what it is that's what leftist ideology is it is a process of divorcing you from the normal human experience and it is done through the guise of first of all divorcing you from the people sitting next to you and getting your attention on some kind of abstract machination and the end result where this is going is that you will burn every Bridge you will run out of options and you will be totally alone that's the end result that's where it goes but nobody tells you that when you're walking down the road and I actually remember this is I remember there were several times when there was this moment of divine intervention when something would happen to shake me like something dramatic would happen and this door would be kicked open for someone to talk sense into me and every time that happened there was always a conservative Republican religious sort of person who was right there like this this golden opportunity fell in their lap to talk to me and just when they had me on the ropes they dropped the ball they gave up they backed off maybe they thought that their job was in jeopardy maybe they were afraid of retribution I don't know what it was but more than once when I was going down that road there was some kind of supernatural effort to stop me and the judeo-christian conservative people who had chances to get through to me consistently missed it because not because they were nasty but because they were always guarded and quiet and almost unwilling to defend the Bible they would come right up to that edge and then I guess they were afraid that I would be offended or whatever and just when I was on the ropes they would stop and I definitely want to encourage conservative Republicans out there listening if you've got a young person you're talking to and you feel this boldness come over you to say something then you need to say something because you never know when that young person could be being bullied or could be depressed and leftist ideology might be their coping mechanism and you never know when you are in the midst of a moment when you can talk sense into them so if you're in that situation and you feel this boldness coming up to you and you feel like you've got them on the ropes you need to be bold and you need to launch into a impassioned defense of judeo-christian philosophy I'm telling you you need to because I'm looking back on my life and I'm realizing if those people had been as bold as what the leftists are cuz the leftists are johnny-on-the-spot with an answer and they're they don't stop there on it and if some of those people in my life on the right if they had been that audacious they could have taken me to the match but they blinked so I was going further and further down this road getting more and more radical and all of my friends were doing that and this carried on until I was my senior year of high school and I actually remember I graduated high school in 1998 but I remember when Columbine happened in 1999 I was not surprised because I understood that whole scene to those of us who had that experience Columbine was completely understandable and there's a lot of young people right now who are going through are getting sucked down that same path now thank God for me that I never went so far as shooting up a school but I wasn't too far off so I really thought by the time that I reached high school senior high I really thought like this world sucks there's nothing to look / - everybody's wrong everybody hates me and I was alone because that's what it does to you you end up alone and the biggest thing that I remember feeling was darkness by the time that I made it to my high school senior year I had already survived two suicide attempts that's that's true the second one was actually bad enough that I missed school for a week and I kept going down this road thinking like I got into this for social justice any day now it'll get better I'm gonna find something real I have to find something real at the end of this road and I never did and when I graduated high school I was literally at the point I thought I was losing my mind and something had to change and finally again I was given another challenge to read the Bible and this time I didn't have anything to lose I said I'll give it a try now I don't want to make this video religious so I don't want to get sidetracked with my journey to becoming a Christian if anybody wants to know that story I'll be happy to tell it later but the Bible was my gateway into a political change and the thing that really changed me was when I started reading the Bible and really listening and paying attention and noticing this pattern all throughout the Bible love your neighbor love your enemy honor your parents live at peace with all men you know all of these great ideals people claim they want but I remember in the Bible it was always in the context of a personal friendship it was never about an institution it was always about the person sitting next to you everything in that whole book is about people and not institutions and you might be hearing that thinking oh that's common sense this was like breaking news to me this rocked my world and I started sitting back saying wait a second now I can't start from the position of being a petulant sarcastic little snitch and then somehow think that that will produce more virtue in society like one of those things does not lead to the other that light boats started going off in my head for the first time ever it was breaking news to me and it really rattled what I thought I knew about culture and society so then I started walking through it like wait a second here my personal life and the people I meet in my daily life that is my little sandbox to practice loving well to cultivate virtue to cultivate an atmosphere of heaven in my world because I can't control the government I can control my world and maybe if I did that and you did that and we all did that at the same time then our society would turn around that was a huge paradigm shift for me when I was probably 21 or 22 when that really started sinking in so then I went off on a mission to try to find like-minded people who were actually practicing personal virtue I went off to find those people and lo and behold I didn't find them on the left and I didn't find them generally speaking in the Democrat Party there are some good Democrats out there I'm not I'm not trying to stereotype the whole party there are a lot of good people who are sort of moderate Center leftists I am not discounting you but what I am saying is I have seen the further you go down that leftist Road the less light there is and when I started comparing personal application of love to what I saw from radical leftists there was just there was no reconciling it was they were so miles apart that I was just like these people are the opposite of what the Bible says literally so I had no choice all I did was just start saying okay I'm gonna meet this person right in front of me ignore their skin color ignore their social class and just throw all that to the side look at them as an individual and watch their behavior that's all I did and I started seeing a crystal clear difference between people on the left and then the normal sensible people who are a part of that normal human experience so that's what pulled me much more over to the political right and that's where I am today and like I said you might be listening to this and you might be thinking oh that's Christianity 101 or that's Judeo that's Western civilization 101 but I'm here to tell you you cannot take it for granted but that's common sense anymore you can't and so many people conservatives people on the right they waste so much time it's Hawking until they're blue in the face saying I love everyone I just I do I just love everyone believe me I love everyone but listen you got to understand when you're talking to a radical socialist the word love doesn't mean what you think it means to them and when you talk about loving people you really can't take it for granted but they know what that word means and the whole time I was searching for something real I never heard a good articulation of that difference I heard you know talking about God's love I heard those things bandied about I heard the gospel bandied about but I never had it hit home for me so I'm here to sort of encourage other people if you've got a young person in your life or you know a young person are you encounter a young person who seems to be brainwashed by leftist ideology first of all you need to feel sorry for them because it really is brainwashing and second of all you got to strip it all the way down to the basics don't take it for granted that you're using the same dictionary because you're not really think hard about what you believe the underpinnings of what you believe the underpinnings of Western civilization you got to come back down to that level and you need to articulate a defence of Western civilization that's what you need to do and if you do that consistently boldly not being afraid of offending them if you go in assuming that what you believe is offensive that's a defeatist mentality don't go in there being on guard saying well I know you won't believe me but this is what I believe you've already defeated yourself be bold be proud of yourself and start coming up with an argument that's better than an apology and I am here to encourage you that if you do that you can start making a difference in more young people's lives you,"Hi everybody I'm a little nervous, so please bear with me as I sort of stumble stumble my way through this story. I've never told this story in public, so you guys are the first to hear the story. Now most of my friends now who know me here in 2018, it's pretty public knowledge that I am a socially conservative economic libertarian who supports the military but doesn't want to do nation-building. I, guess, that's where I am politically I am not registered in any party. I have never campaigned for any candidate, very politically active and informed, but registered independent, that's kind of where I am and for my friends who know me in this way. Most of them have no idea how radical and wacky I was as a young, adult and I guess. I wanted to talk about how young people get sucked into really radical ideology and what shook me out of it. So for me, my story, it began for me basically in my childhood, because I grew up in very extreme poverty. My parents were pretty much the epitome of white trash and I'm, not saying that in a condemning kind of way at all they they know this. They were doing the best they could. It just was what it was, but we were in pretty extreme poverty and for me, as a child living in that world I was bullied quite a bit. I really didn't have any friends, and judging from the grown-ups in my family, I didn't have a whole lot to look forward to so I wanted something better and I was searching for kind of a way to get out of that ditch and when you live in that environment, the only political social option there is is the Democrat Party when I was young. It was made clear to me in no uncertain terms. The Republican Party is a private club for millionaires and they made their fortune by unscrupulous means just period. We didn't know any Republicans never met a millionaire in our life, but we were quite sure that all of them were unscrupulous and they had their own private club. So for me to get involved in any kind of social justice or whatever I was nudged to the left by default. So you kind of you start down this road, wanting happiness, love and fairness, and for everybody to be happy and having a food that that's why you start down the road, but somewhere in the process, it starts getting ugly and usually what happens? Is you begin wanting tolerance, wanting inclusion, but all of a sudden as you go, you start looking for excuses to disqualify people and that's always step one and it's never anything personal. It's always about a philosophy or a policy or a social demographic. That's what it is. Everything is cast in terms of abstract demographics institutions. It's never personal, it's always demographic. So you start off down this road and you start disqualifying well. Why should I bother defending millionaires, millionaire Republicans? What do they need me for and that's the little sleight of hand I'm defending the little guy? What do they need my help, for they don't need me defending them. Now they they're getting along. Without me, they don't care about me. I'm, never gonna meet them. They're, never gonna notice, if I hate them or not. So what difference does it make so they're disqualified, I'm, not a social justice campaign for everyone with them, and then you start moving a little further and then you say: oh, you know I'm going to disqualify those successful people with a nuclear family. You know they're disqualified because they don't understand what the struggle is and they're, probably all just cheating on their spouses and hypocrites anyways, and they don't need my help. So they'll never notice if I hate them so they're disqualified, and then you go down a little further and then you pick off someone else, and then you pick off someone else and next thing you know you're marching down this road, let's get more and more narrow and it's never a personal thing about the lady sitting. Next to you, it's always abstract and at the time that I was getting into this I was really hoping like okay. This is this is like: how will you bring about social justice? This is how you make things better and years would go by, and elections would happen, and we would have this governor that governor and nothing was ever changing and I wasn't seeing any good out of this, and you know you would hear people say you know the Democrats are morally bankrupt and the left is an empty ideology. You would hear these things, but it couldn't be true right because you're investing all of your energy into this fight for the cause, and it can't be an empty ideology. So then you're searching for the meaning behind it. So then you're going further and further into the the thoughts and the thought leaders behind this leftist ideology and you're going further and further down the road and it's getting more and more narrow. So then, by the time that I was in high school I hooked up with this whole group of friends who were really far left I mean we were doing some pretty radical stuff. We actually had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook I'm, not kidding I, remember writing papers in school in defense of domestic terrorism. My friends and I mean they: were they dabbled in witchcraft? They dabbled in sexual perversion experimenting they dabbled in reading nihilistic philosophers, I mean this was the world that I lived in pretty much day in and day out, like those were, my friends that was my social scene, I actually remember being in high school and starting a petition against my high school newspaper, because I thought it had a Christian bias. I seriously did remember doing that. That's just kind of a few examples of the world that I was living in and you're going down this road and you're, just bypassing everything that is common sense, everything that is rational. Everything that makes society stay together and I didn't even realize that I was being systemic ly divorced from the normal human experience. That's what it is. That's what leftist ideology is. It is a process of divorcing you from the normal human experience, and it is done through the guise of first of all divorcing you from the people sitting next to you and getting your attention on some kind of abstract, machination and the end result where this is going is that you will burn every Bridge. You will run out of options and you will be totally alone. That's the end result, that's where it goes, but nobody tells you that when you're walking down the road and I actually remember this is I remember there were several times when there was this moment of divine intervention. When something would happen to shake me like something dramatic would happen, and this door would be kicked open for someone to talk sense into me and every time that happened, there was always a conservative, Republican religious sort of person who was right there like this. This golden opportunity fell in their lap to talk to me and just when they had me on the ropes, they dropped the ball. They gave up they backed off. Maybe they thought that their job was in jeopardy. Maybe they were afraid of retribution, I, don't know what it was, but more than once, when I was going down that road. There was some kind of supernatural effort to stop me and the judeo-christian conservative people who had chances to get through to me consistently missed it, because not because they were nasty but because they were always guarded and quiet and almost unwilling to defend the Bible. They would come right up to that edge and then I guess they were afraid that I would be offended or whatever, and just when I was on the ropes, they would stop and I definitely want to encourage conservative Republicans out there listening if you've got a young person you're talking to, and you feel this boldness come over you to say something. Then you need to say something because you never know when that young person could be being bullied or could be depressed and leftist ideology might be their coping mechanism. And you never know when you are in the midst of a moment when you can talk sense into them. So, if you're in that situation- and you feel this boldness coming up to you and you feel like you've- got them on the ropes, you need to be bold and you need to launch into a impassioned defense of judeo-christian philosophy, I'm telling you you need to because I'm looking back on my life and I'm realizing. If those people had been as bold as what the leftists are cuz the leftists are johnny-on-the-spot with an answer and they're. They don't stop there on it and if some of those people in my life on the right, if they had been that audacious, they could have taken me to the match, but they blinked. So I was going further and further down this road. Getting more and more radical and all of my friends were doing that and this carried on until I was my senior year of high school and I. Actually remember: I graduated high school in 1998, but I remember when Columbine happened in 1999 I was not surprised because I understood that whole scene to those of us who had that experience Columbine was completely understandable and there's a lot of young people right now who are going through are getting sucked down that same path. Now, thank God for me that I never went so far as shooting up a school, but I wasn't too far off. So I really thought by the time that I reached high school senior high I really thought like this world sucks, there's nothing to look / -, everybody's wrong, everybody hates me and I was alone, because that's what it does to you. You end up alone and the biggest thing that I remember feeling was darkness by the time that I made it to my high school senior year. I had already survived two suicide attempts. That's that's true. The second one was actually bad enough that I missed school for a week and I kept going down this road thinking like I, got into this for social justice any day now, it'll get better I'm gonna find something real I have to find something real at the end of this road and I never did, and when I graduated high school I was literally at the point. I thought I was losing my mind and something had to change. And finally, again, I was given another challenge to read the Bible and this time I didn't have anything to lose. I said I'll, give it a try now, I, don't want to make this video religious, so I don't want to get sidetracked with my journey to becoming a Christian. If anybody wants to know that story I'll be happy to tell it later, but the Bible was my gateway into a political change and the thing that really changed me was when I started, reading the Bible and really listening and paying attention and noticing this pattern all throughout the Bible love your neighbor love your enemy honor. Your parents live at peace with all men. You know all of these great ideals people claim they want, but I remember in the Bible. It was always in the context of a personal friendship. It was never about an institution. It was always about the person sitting. Next to you. Everything in that whole book is about people and not institutions, and you might be hearing that thinking. Oh that's common sense! This was like breaking news to me. This rocked my world and I started sitting back, saying, wait a second now I can't start from the position of being a petulant, sarcastic, little snitch and then somehow think that that will produce more virtue in society like one of those things does not lead to the other that light boats started going off in my head for the first time ever, it was breaking news to me and it really rattled what I thought I knew about culture and society. So then I started walking through it like wait a second here, my personal life and the people I meet in my daily life. That is my little sandbox to practice loving, well to cultivate virtue to cultivate an atmosphere of heaven in my world, because I can't control the government. I can control my world, and maybe, if I did that, and you did that- and we all did that at the same time, then our society would turn around. That was a huge paradigm shift for me when I was probably 21 or 22 when that really started sinking in so then, I went off on a mission to try to find like-minded people who were actually practicing personal virtue. I went off to find those people, and lo and behold, I didn't find them on the left and I didn't find them. Generally speaking in the Democrat Party, there are some good Democrats out there, I'm, not I'm, not trying to stereotype the whole party. There are a lot of good people who are sort of moderate Center. Leftists I am not discounting you, but what I am saying is I have seen the further you go down that leftist Road the less light there is and when I started, comparing personal application of love to what I saw from radical leftists there was just there was no reconciling it was they were so miles apart. That I was just like these people are the opposite of what the Bible says. Literally so I had no choice. All I did was just start saying: okay, I'm gonna meet this person right in front of me, ignore their skin color, ignore their social class and just throw all that to the side. Look at them as an individual and watch their behavior. That's all I did and I started, seeing a crystal clear difference between people on the left and then the normal, sensible people who are a part of that normal human experience. So that's what pulled me much more over to the political right and that's where I am today and, like I said you might be listening to this and you might be thinking. Oh that's, Christianity 101 or that's Judeo. That's Western civilization, 101, but I'm here to tell you you cannot take it for granted, but that's common sense anymore. You can't, and so many people, conservatives people on the right they waste so much time. It's Hawking until they're blue in the face saying I love everyone I just I, do I just love. Everyone believe me: I, love everyone, but listen. You got to understand when you're talking to a radical socialist, the word love doesn't mean what you think it means to them and when you talk about loving people, you really can't take it for granted, but they know what that word means and the whole time I was searching for something real I, never heard a good articulation of that difference. I heard you know talking about God's love, I heard those things bandied about, I heard the gospel bandied about, but I never had it hit home for me. So I'm here to sort of encourage other people. If you've got a young person in your life or you know a young person, are you encounter a young person who seems to be brainwashed by leftist ideology? First of all, you need to feel sorry for them because it really is brainwashing and second of all, you got to strip it all the way down to the basics. Don't take it for granted that you're using the same dictionary, because you're not really think hard about what you believe, the underpinnings of what you believe, the underpinnings of Western civilization. You got to come back down to that level and you need to articulate a defence of Western civilization. That's what you need to do and if you do that consistently boldly, not being afraid of offending them. If you go in assuming that what you believe is offensive, that's a defeatist mentality! Don't go in there being on guard saying well, I know you won't believe me, but this is what I believe you've already defeated yourself. Be bold, be proud of yourself and start coming up with an argument. That's better than an apology, and I am here to encourage you that if you do that, you can start making a difference in more young people's lives. You."
71,7RBworggjM8,hi my name is janet i'm 69 years old a lifelong democrat and i have walked away our story began back several years ago and friends were starting to open our eyes to what was going on with the democratic party and showing us what was wrong and we just didn't believe them we thought they were just being silly foolish and we just kind of brushed them off but over the years several other family members had also started telling us the same thing that our friends were telling us and we're starting to pay attention now and we voted for obama the first time and we thought voting for hemi well he was a great speaker we were quite impressed with everything he said he was going to do but he gets into office and doesn't do anything that he said he was going to do he was a complete disappointment so by the time he was coming up for a re-election at that point we decided we are not going to vote for obama this time we're going to vote republican and mitt romney was running and i was not impressed with him at all but since i was not going to vote for obama i wasn't going to not vote so i went to the polling place and cast my vote for mitt romney and i literally cried the whole way home the whole way home i was so upset because the first time in my life i had voted for a republican for president and it just broke my heart i just i just didn't know what to do i did get over it thank goodness so um fast forward to 2016 and trump was running for president and i couldn't believe it i'm like you got to be kidding he's a businessman a game show host and who does he think he is he's not a politician but i held my nose and voted for him and i was happy that he won because there was no way i wanted hillary to win there was just no way in hell i was going to ever cast my vote for her ever so and i started talking on facebook about it and i got into really serious arguments with longtime friends and they just they unfriended me they blocked me they and their friends were bullying me it was awful so i i blocked all their friends i i just didn't need to put up with that kind of crap i just didn't need it in my life so you know and my family members are not happy my immediate family is fine they're all they've all walked away with me my husband and my kids they all walked away with me but other family members i'm sure they think i'm just a lunatic i don't speak to them speak to one i keep in touch with another family member but it's it's tense it really gets tense because i know they think i'm just an idiot and i'm not i don't think i'm an idiot at all i think i'm smart so that's really pretty much my story really not much to it but i am happier i'm calmer i'm not as angry as i was when i was a democrat i just feel more at ease around conservatives it just seems to fit my my values the way i feel that i should live my life more with freedom and less government i don't want our rights being taken away our first and second amendment rights that's very important to me and i know if biden gets in they're going to be they're going to be taking those rights away they've already said they want to so to me that is just frightening it's just it's a horrible horrible thing so i'm going to be uh voting red for the rest of my life so like i said i walked away i'm proud to have done it and i'm proud to belong to this beautiful group,"Hi, my name is janet, I'm 69 years old, a lifelong democrat and I have walked away. Our story began back several years ago and friends were starting to open our eyes to what was going on with the democratic party and showing us what was wrong and we just didn't believe them. We thought they were just being silly foolish and we just kind of brushed them off, but over the years several other family members had also started telling us the same thing that our friends were telling us and we're starting to pay attention now, and we voted for obama the first time and we thought voting for hemi. Well, he was a great speaker. We were quite impressed with everything he said he was going to do, but he gets into office and doesn't do anything that he said he was going to do. He was a complete disappointment, so, by the time he was coming up for a re-election. At that point we decided we are not going to vote for obama this time, we're going to vote republican and mitt romney was running and I was not impressed with him at all. But since I was not going to vote for obama, I wasn't going to not vote so I went to the polling place and cast my vote for mitt romney and I literally cried the whole way home the whole way home. I was so upset because the first time in my life, I had voted for a republican for president and it just broke my heart. I just I just didn't know what to do. I did get over it. Thank goodness so um fast forward to 2016 and trump was running for president, and I couldn't believe it. I'm like you got to be kidding, he's a businessman, a game show host and who does he think he is he's, not a politician, but I held my nose and voted for him and I was happy that he won because there was no way I wanted hillary to win. There was just no way in hell. I was going to ever cast my vote for her ever so, and I started talking on facebook about it, and I got into really serious arguments with longtime friends and they just they unfriended me. They blocked me, they and their friends were bullying me. It was awful, so I I blocked all their friends. I I just didn't need to put up with that kind of crap. I just didn't need it in my life, so you know, and my family members are not happy. My immediate family is fine. They're all they've all walked away with me, my husband and my kids. They all walked away with me, but other family members, I'm sure they think I'm just a lunatic. I don't speak to them, speak to one. I keep in touch with another family member, but it's it's tense. It really gets tense because I know they think I'm just an idiot and I'm not. I don't think I'm an idiot at all. I think I'm smart, so that's really pretty much. My story really not much to it, but I am happier I'm calmer, I'm not as angry as I was. When I was a democrat. I just feel more at ease around conservatives. It just seems to fit my my values the way I feel that I should live my life more with freedom and less government. I don't want our rights being taken away, our first and second amendment rights, that's very important to me, and I know if biden gets in they're, going to be they're going to be taking those rights away. They've already said they want to so to me that is just frightening. It's just it's a horrible horrible thing, so I'm going to be uh voting red for the rest of my life. So, like I said, I walked away. I'm proud to have done it and I'm proud to belong to this beautiful group."
72,7xOSXqyysjA,hi this is my walkaway video I wanted to I had done one before and it got cut off so we're doing it and I'm really glad I'm doing a second one because I've it's more in-depth that I think we might phrase it as it's not walking away from the Democrats or democratic plantation although that's part of it but we're really walking away from is the erosion of the Constitution is the disparaging and diminishing attitude towards what the Founding Fathers established as the United States of America so mine I'll make it short what could be long but I've seen some really short ones and they're fantastic um is that I was raised in a very left-wing household my father was I won't even say a rabid liberal though I used to frame him that way or refer to him that way but he have she was communistic he tried to join the Communist Party during I think it was World War two he dodged getting into he wasn't even he was a draft dodger basically he pretended he was insane so they wouldn't draft him into the army which is really shameful but his brother went in I think he was in the Marines but anyway hate my father was not into that I think he was terrified to death to be honest in any case he fed me and my sister daily on what his belief system was which was anti-government anti-american he was a first generation immigrant on second generation on his side his parents could literally came over from Sicily on Ellis Island you know they'd have a name change cuz her name wasn't that difficult otherwise they would and my grandparents made a real life here they my grandmother was a seamstress my grandfather was a tailor ray Sicilian traditional occupations and they may have their own businesses and own property and even a little oil derrick and they did well for themselves here and they didn't complain about America or hate it in fact they were so blessed and so appreciative my father for whatever reason hated it and transferred that to me like through osmosis and and through very definite statements continually through my childhood so I grew up that way and I was a bleeding-heart liberal and I did all liberal things in protests and it's just you know had that view that worldview and and the worldview where you don't think for yourself where you don't examine you don't question you know it's important to question any side so in the end when my son right after my son was born nineteen years ago I came to Christ and in that amazing transformation of becoming a new creature in him over a period of probably two years I would say two to three years my politics completely changed and I started realizing that conservatism wasn't the enemy that it I had shared the same morals the same values and I was changed on the inside so I wasn't this renegade person who just wanted my own way to do what I wanted and nobody tell me what to do that was gone for me and I renounced all that stuff I didn't want it in my life because it's just self-centered really and then you justify yourself centered missing in any case now once when in the 2016 elections just before and I was I'd been living in Australia for many many years where I came to Christ and I came back the Lord was leading me back I worked with Native American kids on a reservation and that was during the election and they were incredibly blue there but the most of the state I was in South Dakota was red in any case but it was like you felt you could not say anything and when I came back to America I couldn't believe how divided it was it wasn't it was just shocking and so disheartening in nonetheless I got to vote in the snow for president Trump before he was president I'd been praying for him for months I hadn't wanted to vote for him initially I was a ben Carson person but when he decided to stop campaigning and he withdrew I just looked to the Lord and said well Who am I going to support now what is this Lord and when he told me it was Trump I was like huh what that man and then he showed me behind the scenes what was really going on and how we needed a man like that for this time someone who could you know we didn't pull any punches someone who in the dogfight of the media would actually come up on top because they are vicious and people who are soft-spoken or not fighters are just not gonna make it in this kind of system and the dog chooses who he chooses like he chose Cyrus and he brought Israel back to its senses and I believe this is part of the plan for a present Trump to bring America back to its senses and and to honor the Constitution it's like the Constitution is absolutely been desecrated for four decades now and whether it's a second Amendment whether it's the lack of value for life life itself inside we're outside the womb where the people's rights are diminished the surveillance all of that it's we need to return to what this country was founded on and I believe that's what we're really walking away from the corruption not just the left yes the left it can be it can be a myriad of different stances but yeah the left embodies it but it's walking away from the line that this country is to be run by money mongers by the political elite by globalists know this country is to be run for buy and leave the people and I'm so thankful that I was shown through the Lord what really matters and each one of us does and that's what this country should be about so god bless you all and that's my walk away [Music],"Hi this is my walkaway video I wanted to I had done one before and it got cut off so we're doing it and I'm really glad I'm doing a second one, because I've it's more in-depth. That I think we might phrase it as it's not walking away from the Democrats or democratic plantation, although that's part of it, but we're really walking away from is the erosion of the Constitution is the disparaging and diminishing attitude towards what the Founding Fathers established as the United States of America? So mine I'll make it short what could be long but I've seen some really short ones and they're fantastic um is that I was raised in a very left-wing household. My father was I, won't even say a rabid liberal though I used to frame him that way or refer to him that way, but he have she was communistic.

Basically, he pretended he was insane, so they wouldn't draft him into the army, which is really shameful, but his brother went in I think he was in the Marines, but anyway hate. My father was not into that I think he was terrified to death. To be honest, in any case, he fed me and my sister daily on what his belief system was, which was anti-government anti-american. He was a first generation immigrant on second generation. On his side. His parents could literally came over from Sicily on Ellis Island. You know, they'd have a name change, cuz, her name. Wasn't that difficult, otherwise they would, and my grandparents made a real life here. They, my grandmother, was a seamstress. My grandfather was a tailor ray Sicilian, traditional occupations and they may have their own businesses and own property and even a little oil derrick, and they did well for themselves here and they didn't complain about America or hate it. In fact they were so blessed and so appreciative. My father, for whatever reason hated it and transferred that to me, like, through osmosis and and through very definite statements continually through my childhood. So I grew up that way and I was a bleeding-heart. Liberal and I did all liberal things in protests, and it's just you know had that view that worldview and and the worldview where you don't think for yourself, where you don't examine you, don't question, you know it's important to question any side. So in the end, when my son, right after my son, was born nineteen years ago, I came to Christ and in that amazing transformation of becoming a new creature in him over a period of probably two years, I would say two to three years. My politics completely changed and I started. Realizing that conservatism wasn't the enemy that it I had shared the same morals. The same values and I was changed on the inside. So I wasn't this renegade person who just wanted my own way to do what I wanted and nobody tell me what to do. That was gone for me and I renounced all that stuff. I didn't want it in my life because it's just self-centered really and then you justify yourself centered missing in any case now, once when in the 2016 elections just before and I was I'd been living in Australia for many many years where I came to Christ and I came back, the Lord was leading me back. I worked with Native American kids on a reservation, and that was during the election and they were incredibly blue there, but the most of the state I was in South. Dakota was red in any case, but it was like you felt. You could not say anything and when I came back to America I couldn't believe how divided it was. It wasn't. It was just shocking and so disheartening in nonetheless, I got to vote in the snow for president Trump before he was president I'd been praying for him for months. I hadn't wanted to vote for him. Initially I was a ben Carson person, but when he decided to stop campaigning- and he withdrew I just looked to the Lord and said well, Who am I going to support. Now. What is this Lord and when he told me it was Trump I was like huh what that man and then he showed me behind the scenes what was really going on and how we needed a man like that for this time. Someone who could you know we didn't pull any punches. Someone who, in the dogfight of the media would actually come up on top because they are vicious and people who are soft-spoken or not fighters are just not gonna, make it in this kind of system and the dog chooses who he chooses like he chose Cyrus and he brought Israel back to its senses and I believe this is part of the plan for a present Trump to bring America back to its senses and and to honor the Constitution. It's like the Constitution is absolutely been desecrated for four decades now, and whether it's a second Amendment, whether it's the lack of value for life life itself inside we're outside the womb, where the people's rights are diminished, the surveillance. All of that, it's we need to return to what this country was founded on and I. Believe that's what we're really walking away from the corruption, not just the left. Yes, the left it can be. It can be a myriad of different stances, but yeah the left embodies it, but it's walking away from the line that this country is to be run by money mongers by the political elite by globalists know this country is to be run for, buy and leave the people and I'm so thankful that I was shown through the Lord. What really matters and each one of us does and that's what this country should be about. So god bless you all and that's my walk away. [Music]."
73,7zYnHYGbtSw,my name is Nicole I'm from North Carolina and I've got some notes here because I don't want to ramble on and I do want to make a couple of points so you'll send me look down every once in a while I just want to give you quickly my background I'm a registered independent I am in my 50s and I had always voted kind of a mixture of both Democrats and Republicans and I did that early on because I felt like it was a good balance like we needed a balance of thought in our government and among policy makers but as time progressed through the 80s into the 90s I could see kind of the fringes of the radical left beginning to creep into the Democrats and I had become concerned about that and so I started still voting a mixture of Democrats and Republicans but I kept that mixture more on a local level and voted more conservative on the federal level then kind of move into the early 2000s I have a friend who is very active in women's issues she's a strict feminist and she was part of her local Democrat Party organization and we were discussing some issues and she kept coming back around to the phrase of well the ends justify the means and I cannot get on board with that and I know when at first I thought it was just her but then when I came to learn more about the Democrats that's really where they come from and I'm not gonna say all Democrats actually my mother is a registered Democrat and she walked away from the Democrat Party a long time ago she just never changed her affiliation officially at the at the voting office because she said that she likes to get into discussions and then when people accuse her of oh well you're just a Republican you won't understand and she says no I'm a registered Democrat so she's one of those who says that the Democrat Party walked away from her a long time ago so my mother is a registered Democrat I have a sister that's a registered Republican who votes straight Republican ticket and has for a long time so we come from a pretty diverse you know political thought within our family but anyway getting back to my friend yeah they pretty much hold the the thought of the ends justify the means that means that they can lie if they need to cheat if they need to exhort you know or move into violence if they need to and to them as long as they meet there in game it doesn't matter to them how they get there and I cannot go along with that you know there's you have to have a moral compass which guides you in your everyday life and how you approach problems and how you approach policy so that was one thing that really put my radar up regarding the Democrats now that was back in early 2000 they have since continued to move in that direction I started to do some homework for myself and I found out more about the infiltration of the Democrat Party by the Communist Party USA and the agenda of the Communist Party and the agenda of the Communist Party if you go and do your own homework really is to is to conquer different enterprises within the United States which gives them power and those enterprises are academia Hollywood the media healthcare that was a big one there's several others but those are some of the and you can see it exactly where they have crept in and then taken a foothold in those things in order to sway Americans their thought and for them to gain power in American politics and their agenda in that sense has worked and you know that's been something that's been going on for decades they've been progressing slowly but surely but it comes from a Marxist background so when Barack Obama came on the scene in 2008 excuse me my husband and I my husband who's actually from North Africa he is Jewish and we were watching all the things about you know the 2008 campaign and we began to at first we were kind of impressed with Barack Obama and I you know I began to think hey listen maybe this is somebody I can get behind I kind of I like to swagger I like the way he spoke he was you know but that was very early in his campaign and said my husband and I did some homework on him and found out that he was actually very entrenched in Marxism I could not get behind that I already haven't done my homework on what was going on with the Democrats and the infiltration by the Communist Party USA and what their agenda was and and the fact that the ends justifies the means so it didn't matter that he could stand up there and lie to everybody's faces knowing that that he had an agenda towards something else because that's what they do when I found out about his background more about his background more about his upbringing more about who it was that was his mentor then you know I was I was totally mm-hmm I was like there's no way I'm pulling the lever for him of course he won and we endured eight years of him and then along came Hillary Clinton and with Hillary then we just got more of the continuation of the same thing of the ends justifies the means now we're going to resort to violence now we're going to divide people even further Barack Obama did a good job of that during his eight years alienating people dividing people stirring up hate and that's what the Democrats do they create a crisis then they blame the crisis on other people and then they they introduce their solution to the crisis which is themselves so because for them the ends justifies the means so you know back in the 2000 2000s I just quit voting for Democrats even though I had voted a mixture before so I walked away from them during that time my mother walked away from them a long time ago and my husband has never voted for a Democrat my sister votes straight Republican ticket so I'm still a registered independent and I will continue to be I lean more toward conservative and libertarian and my thoughts on the Constitution is is the strongest document ever written by any government trying to secure the freedom of people and given giving them a voice in their government so if it is applied correctly and it needs to be applied correctly but it is not outdated it is a very strong document and I think it's the best one ever written for any country to the people that have walked away and are you know were caught up in Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and all the pomp and circumstance we you know surrounding them and still have friends entrenched in that that mindset I just want you to know by coming you know to this group I think that you're finding a home it does not mean that you have to go and register as a Republican it doesn't mean that that it doesn't mean anything other than you have a place here to have freedom of thought freedom of speech each and piece in your life that you're not going to be attacked for your thoughts that we all love you and you're accepted here and one thing that I will tell you and this is for my fellow you know Christians out there anybody who's God believing if that's not you and you're not into that just give me a moment now come back around but I'm speaking to those other ones you know I've been praying for a long time for God to begin to wake people up and I've been praying what Jesus said that there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed and I'm glad that things are being revealed and I'm glad that there's peace coming to all of our citizens as Americans so continue to pray with me on that on that in but the last thing that I'm going to say is the only wave I think that the Democrats are going to see coming up is this group of people waving goodbye okay so we love you all I'm glad that you're here I'm glad that you're part of free thinkers independent thinkers I want you to continue to do your homework I want you to continue to research the Constitution if you've never done that and I want you to find out more about the convention of states article five convention of states and the movement going on across our nation right now regarding that which has already been passed in several state houses which is very important because that gives a lot more power and voice to the people so anyway I love you all America I'm glad to be a part of this I will be a part of Brandon's walk on Washington when that's organized so I hope to see you there okay love you up bye you my name is Nicole I'm from North Carolina and I've got some notes here because I don't want to ramble on

In American politics and their agenda in that sense has worked, and you know that's been something that's been going on for decades. They've been progressing slowly but surely, but it comes from a Marxist background.

So you know back in the 2000 2000s I just quit. Voting for Democrats, even though I had voted a mixture before so I walked away from them. During that time, my mother walked away from them a long time ago and my husband has never voted for a Democrat. My sister votes straight Republican ticket, so I'm still a registered independent and I will continue to be I lean more toward conservative and libertarian, and my thoughts on the Constitution is: is the strongest document ever written by any government trying to secure the freedom of people and given giving them a voice in their government?

You know to this group I think that you're finding a home it does not mean that you have to go and register as a Republican. It doesn't mean that that it doesn't mean anything other than you have a place here to have freedom of thought, freedom of speech each and piece in your life that you're not going to be attacked for your thoughts that we all love you and you're accepted here, and one thing that I will tell you- and this is for my fellow you know- Christians out there- anybody who's God, believing if that's not you and you're not into that. Just give me a moment now come back around but I'm speaking to those other ones. You know I've been praying for a long time for God to begin to wake. People up and I've been praying what Jesus said that there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed and I'm glad that things are being revealed and I'm glad that there's peace coming to all of our citizens as Americans, so continue to pray with me on that on that in. But the last thing that I'm going to say is the only wave I think that the Democrats are going to see coming up. Is this group of people waving goodbye? Okay? So we love you all I'm glad that you're here I'm glad that you're part of free thinkers, independent thinkers I want you to continue to do your homework. I want you to continue to research, the Constitution, if you've never done that and I want you to find out more about the convention of states, article five convention of states and the movement going on across our nation right now regarding that which has already been passed in several state houses, which is very important, because that gives a lot more power and voice to the people so anyway, I love, you all America I'm glad to be a part of this I will be a part of Brandon's walk on Washington when that's organized so I hope to see you there. Okay, love you up! Bye! You."

76,8cRm2VpQ8Z4,patriots uh my name is susan and uh i have been with this walk away campaign since i found out about it the first time i saw brandon talking about a time he went into a video store and tried to buy some video cameras and the guy wouldn't serve him and i haven't heard him talk about that again since since that time but i think it was pretty pretty close to the beginning and uh i told him i would make a video and here i am it is quarter to 12 on saturday night making a video uh so i am a canadian i've been here though in the states for 27 years i got married to an american he took me from my country and dragged me kicking and screaming down no just kidding he he he was conservative he's always been conservative but he took me to alabama where we first started out our our adventure or my adventure and uh i really got to see uh that the states was a lot different than i had thought i'd been to seattle i'd been you know many many countries in the world but i didn't really understand what made the america so great i was like you know they're all us canadians we always think you guys are full of yourselves and way too patriotic and just like ugh you know oh those americans they're just really stuck on themselves what's up with that you know well now i really understand the patriotism is like really here i mean i i've cried so many times during the anthems it's really ridiculous and i feel like the more i live here the more i realize what a special place this is and what freedoms we do have that we take for granted and um everybody sh i mean really we should be teaching this in school um about our our rights of citizens and the constitution i mean we should have a really freaking whole class on the constitution in in middle school and then again in high school should be like a you know another language because it really is so important uh to understand why we fought for the freedom why this country you know fought for its freedom from england and why what makes it different i grew up in you know canada and my parents were british and i was definitely raised conservative i would say but they were definitely on the more liberal side of of everything i and i don't really understand why except that i think because they had noble no faith in god no religion that they realized they did i don't think they realized how important um god was to the health of a country i think you know people i've talked to at my church from cuba they understand how valuable it is they um people from you know mexico venezuela everybody people who who don't have it they realize how important it is the canadians are just kind of waking up now i think i'm talking to you know a few of my friends some of them think i have lost my mind and i am a traitor and i lost my canadian values but of course i have all of the same values that i did when i lived there i want i want justice i want the truth i want freedom of expression and religion and freedom of speech and all of these things i just don't want to um be indebted to the government i want to be able to you know leave lead my own life the way i wanted i want to see it go and i don't want to have restrictions put on by the government that they the more more laws we have the more government we have the harder it is to get things done especially i know in this state of new jersey wow i mean the licensing and the fees are abs they're absolutely ridiculous like if you compare them to the rest of the country it's ridiculous i don't even know why i'm living here except that i have now a good job and i told my boss i would not leave but um and he's a great he's a great guy so i think that you know walking away is it's really it's a no-brainer i mean we just have to wake up the people who are still asleep and just following this mainstream media off the cliff and believing all this ridiculousness about the you know i don't know just everything is ridiculous that it comes out of their mouths sometimes oh yeah i heard um i heard you can get coven now they tested men's semen there's covet in the semen so that means we're going to be passing it on like a venereal disease to our kids yuck oh my gosh it's crazy anyways i digress um but i wanted to say thank you to everybody for supporting me because i feel have i've felt very alone for a long time um and it's hard to be the one that has the odd opinion and doesn't you know doesn't feel comfortable voicing it but now i've got a lot more support and i feel like there's no no way you can't you can't not talk about it and you can't be quiet and silent so i will see you all at the march in october and uh hopefully before that but um yes i am glad to be a part of this group and i thank you brandon for starting it and uh i love you guys all right talk to you later,"Patriots uh, my name, is susan and uh. I have been with this walk away campaign since I found out about it the first time I saw brandon talking about a time he went into a video store and tried to buy some video cameras and the guy wouldn't serve him, and I haven't heard him talk about that again since since that time, but I think it was pretty pretty close to the beginning and uh. I told him I would make a video- and here I am, it is quarter to 12 on saturday night making a video uh. So I am a canadian I've been here, though, in the states for 27 years I got married to an american. He took me from my country and dragged me kicking and screaming down no just kidding he he he was conservative, he's always been conservative, but he took me to alabama where we first started out our our adventure or my adventure and uh. I really got to see uh that the states was a lot different than I had thought. I'd been to seattle. I'd been, you know many many countries in the world, but I didn't really understand what made the america so great. I was like you know, they're all us canadians. We always think you guys are full of yourselves and way too patriotic and just like ugh, you know, oh those americans, they're, just really stuck on themselves. What's up with that, you know! Well now I really understand the patriotism is like really here I mean I I've cried so many times during the anthems. It's really ridiculous and I feel like the more I live here. The more I realize what a special place this is and what freedoms we do have that we take for granted and um everybody sh I mean really. We should be teaching this in school um about our our rights of citizens and the constitution. I mean we should have a really freaking whole class on the constitution in in middle school and then again in high school should be like a you know, another language, because it really is so important uh to understand why we fought for the freedom why this country, you know, fought for its freedom from england and why? What makes it different I grew up in you know. Canada and my parents were british and I was definitely raised conservative I would say, but they were definitely on the more liberal side of of everything I- and I don't really understand why, except that I think, because they had noble no faith in god, no religion that they realized they did. I don't think they realized how important um god was to the health of a country. I think you know people I've talked to at my church from cuba. They understand how valuable it is they um people from you, know: mexico, venezuela, everybody people who who don't have it. They realize how important it is. The canadians are just kind of waking up now. I think I'm talking to you know a few of my friends. Some of them think I have lost my mind and I am a traitor and I lost my canadian values, but of course I have all of the same values that I did when I lived there. I want. I want justice, I want the truth. I want freedom of expression and religion and freedom of speech and all of these things I just don't want to um, be indebted to the government I want to be able to. You know, leave lead my own life. The way I wanted, I want to see it go, and I don't want to have restrictions put on by the government that they, the more more laws. We have the more government we have the harder it is to get things done, especially, I know in this state of new jersey wow I mean the licensing and the fees are abs, they're, absolutely ridiculous, like if you compare them to the rest of the country. It's ridiculous. I don't even know why I'm living here, except that I have now a good job, and I told my boss, I would not leave but um and he's a great he's, a great guy. So I think that you know walking away. Is it's really it's a no-brainer? I mean we just have to wake up the people who are still asleep and just following this mainstream media off the cliff and believing all this ridiculousness about the you know. I don't know just everything is ridiculous that it comes out of their mouths. Sometimes oh yeah, I heard um, I heard you can get coven now they tested men's semen, there's covet in the semen, so that means we're going to be passing it on like a venereal disease to our kids yuck. Oh my gosh, it's crazy anyways. I digress um, but I wanted to say thank you to everybody for supporting me because I feel have I've felt very alone for a long time. Um and it's hard to be the one that has the odd opinion and doesn't you know, doesn't feel comfortable voicing it. But now I've got a lot more support and I feel like there's no, no way you can't you can't not talk about it and you can't be quiet and silent. So I will see you all at the march in october and uh. Hopefully, before that, but um, yes, I am glad to be a part of this group and I thank you brandon for starting it and uh. I love you guys all right talk to you later."
77,8CVCZxAWn6c,this would be my luck with walk away vidiian here on the streets of Los Angeles white guy can't wear a trump hat can't have a bumper sticker on my car for fear of you know damages fear of people getting angry and attacking me or doing bad things my car scratching it up flatten our desires and beating it up of whatever but uh you know when I first say thank you thank you for a people that's branding Straka that's you know people at candis's people that have walked away from democrat party people that are renouncing that hatred you know renouncing the idea that because somebody's white with the racist walking away from the bad policies and the sword losing whatever you want to call it the establishment walking away from the establishment thank you you know making a video it's not easy I tried to make one it turned out 40 minutes long too long and it's too much to say you know I'm an independent he never was a Democrat and if I was a Republican but I walked away from the establishment a long time ago you know I walked away from the supporters then that's a walk away from the super super conservative Republicans that in a preach whatever all the time I walked towards the policies at Donald Trump that together I walked towards those because they're they're related that's he knows what our country needs it's all related this starts with jobs in the American Dream you can't have the American Dream without jobs you end up on welfare without the jobs you end up depressed when you're on welfare without a job you end up doing drugs because you're depressed or you end up doing crime because you don't have a way to get any you end up you know without health insurance because you can't afford it you end up you know sick and other things it's all a downhill spiral if you don't take care of the jobs and if you don't take care of the balance of the job market supply and demand works in the job market just like every other market we have a supply of workers an overabundance of workers they're not worth anything they're not worth anything when you have too many of something and we've had an overabundance of workers and not a big good enough supply of jobs and that has allowed the big companies to hire almost all minimum-wage workers and get rid of their higher paid employees and drive wages down for the last couple decades walk away from that walk away from that walk away from people that want to add more people to the mix until we can correct the market until we can fix our wages fix our American dream you know so we can get our suburbs and our communities out of poverty and off of the welfare to the best degree that we possibly can until we can do that we have to we have to keep keep track of what's going on if to keep track of what's going on with the job market we have to keep track of what's going on with integration and we do need we do need some kind of immigration reform that we need to fix it we need to get it so that people who come here illegally but at a balance that works with our not only job market ok but also our infrastructure okay we've got crumbling cities you know the roads bridges whatever blah blah blah okay but yeah we got I live in Los Angeles we have some of the worst roads in the nation and we paid the most taxes and we're bringing in the most people to just make it that much worse and we're paying 24 million or 240 million whatever it was towards their legal defense to come here illegally hey why are we gonna pay a legal offense to do something illegal anyways walk away from this thank you [Music],"This would be my luck with walk away. Vidiian here on the streets of Los, Angeles white guy, can't wear a trump hat. Can't have a bumper sticker on my car, for fear of you know, damages fear of people getting angry and attacking me or doing bad things. My car scratching it up flatten our desires and beating it up of whatever but uh. You know when I first say. Thank you. Thank you for a people, that's branding Straka! That's you know people at candis's, people that have walked away from democrat party people that are renouncing that hatred. You know renouncing the idea that, because somebody's white with the racist walking away from the bad policies and the sword losing whatever you want to call it, the establishment walking away from the establishment. Thank you. You know making a video. It's not easy. I tried to make one. It turned out 40 minutes long too long, and it's too much to say you know, I'm an independent. He never was a Democrat and if I was a Republican but I walked away from the establishment a long time ago. You know I walked away from the supporters, then that's a walk away from the super super conservative Republicans that in a preach, whatever all the time I walked towards the policies at Donald Trump that together I walked towards those because they're they're related. That's, he knows what our country needs. It's all related. This starts with jobs in the American Dream. You can't have the American Dream without jobs, you end up on welfare without the jobs you end up depressed when you're on welfare without a job, you end up doing drugs because you're depressed or you end up doing crime, because you don't have a way to get any. You end up. You know without health insurance because you can't afford it. You end up. You know, sick and other things. It's all a downhill spiral, if you don't take care of the jobs and if you don't take care of the balance of the job market supply and demand works in the job market. Just like every other market. We have a supply of workers, an overabundance of workers, they're not worth anything they're, not worth anything. When you have too many of something and we've had an overabundance of workers and not a big good enough supply of jobs, and that has allowed the big companies to hire almost all minimum-wage workers and get rid of their higher paid employees and drive wages down for the last couple decades, walk away from that walk away from that walk away from people that want to add more people to the mix. Until we can correct the market until we can fix our wages, fix our American dream, you know, so we can get our suburbs and our communities out of poverty and off of the welfare to the best degree that we possibly can until we can do that, we have to. We have to keep keep track of what's going on if to keep track of. What's going on with the job market, we have to keep track of what's going on with integration and we do need. We do need some kind of immigration reform that we need to fix it. We need to get it so that people who come here illegally, but at a balance that works with our not only job market, ok, but also our infrastructure. Okay, we've got crumbling cities, you know the roads, bridges, whatever blah blah blah. Okay, but yeah. We got I live in Los Angeles. We have some of the worst roads in the nation and we paid the most taxes and we're bringing in the most people to just make it that much worse and we're paying 24 million or 240 million whatever it was towards their legal defense to come here illegally, hey. Why are we gonna pay a legal offense to do something illegal, anyways, walk away from this? Thank you. [Music]."

This is my walk away. Campaign: video I'm, not a Russian bot I am an anti-war protester. I am Pro peace and peace. Promoting I was raised a Navy brat I support our troops and love our veterans. I. Remember the Gulf War Desert shield/desert storm I. Remember the first battle of mogadishu. There's been nine since 1993. These events stuck with me since childhood I, remember: every conflict, war, operation and invasion loss of life I have studied all I can about these events in my pursuit of peace, someone once said the Clintons are so great because they gave them free school lunch as a kid. Well, they gave me free suspicious package and bomb drill. Training and I got a little bit of free lunch as well. I was in my final year of high school when 9/11 happened. This is when my anti-war protests truly began. Even then, those around me on the Left were ready to cause violence. Most were too scared, but the misguided anger was there. Many things have happened since the Bush years. That proved to me that the Democrats are pro-war. Pro aggression, Pro violence, I, was very disappointed with President Obama's change. Very disappointed. I've never had much hope. I'm a bit of a pessimist. I was not surprised that Obama became the first two-term president, with the distinction of having US military forces at war for all eight years of his tenure Plus. So much worse than that, I was told in 2016. I have to pick the lesser of two evils: I was not sure who or what that was so I abstained entirely from voting I'm, certainly not voting for evil. I was very relieved when Hillary lost, probably the only liberal, to be crying tears of joy, though I was still having some anxiety about Trump and the uncertainty of what happens next. That is why I chose to walk away. I got angry after 9/11 and I have been angry ever since the only difference now is I know everyone I should be angry with I. Don't need your civil war.

79,8GVxdpgZTeU,hey Ivy easily make this video an hour two hours long I tend to ramble so I'm going to a little bit of editing to make sure that I am getting some main points I wonder across and so first BAM obviously I'm a drag queen so I wanted to share this video in drag because I want to break some stereotypes about being a drag queen being trans being in the queer community being a minority you don't need to follow a certain set of rules you don't need to follow certain restrictions and in fact this time the opposite of what we're all working towards in terms of getting to a place where we can have self-government and not have to worry about what other people think about us I am someone who is always had been against big corporations big banks rough government unfair policing I was actually in st. Louis during the Mike Brown shooting and I was part of my clubs matter rallies wanting to make sure that there weren't people being mistreated there weren't unjust policies in place so I'm someone who cares very much about the underdog and I want to make sure that everyone is getting a voice and being heard when I do drag I don't really do a lot of performing I don't do it to make money and I like to go out make people feel special help people kind of find that inner energy in themselves to feel special about themselves I think in society there's a very low level of interaction that we currently have and a lot of times in the grand scheme of things we kind of forget about individual people I didn't know my parents I was abused as a child and that kind of upbringing raised me to field I always need to question authority and I always need to make sure that people are being heard and that we're understanding that people need to be understood of where they might have come from that you don't know what that is you don't know what they've been through I always thought the liberal side of the argument was the correct side aside for justice and goodwill and caring about people and I tended to see that conservative side as being kind of overzealous religious not trying much about people and kind of focusing on money somebody's back I moved to recive area and I think that saturation of seeing a lot of progressive people in the same spot has kind of started to show me what's going on I started to notice a lot of people who were extremely intolerant but they said they were the most tolerant people around you had to watch everything you sat around them you know to watch everything you did around them your freedom was pretty much gone and subject to their control there was still a lot of jokes and negativity around but it was basically decided that you needed to direct that at the groups that we don't like why straight says Christian male and as a minority if you didn't join in with that if he didn't join in with attacking those groups so if you said hey maybe we should attack them quite so harshly maybe we should accept people then you kind of lost your minority card so like if you're black they'd say oh why are you white if you're gay you lose your gay card really silly stuff and the weird thing is that can't treat you like you're not on minority anymore like you're part of the problem now which is weird because you are still a minority if you really think about it all these people everyone talking about how they're other how they have concerns about the liberal community is still very much minority and the fact that their voices aren't being respected by the community is a huge red flag and the people they attack they attack with hate and malice and spite and and disturbing comments if you took some of the comments on Twitter and Facebook and you replace the majority groups with minority groups the comments would be obviously disgusting hate speech but they always have some kind of excuse the new definition of racism oh I'm I have I'm a minority I'm a minority so I have a lot of aggression built up oh they had it coming they had their time they were mean to us and I mean be mean to them that wasn't the biggest wake up rose for me scene was supposed to be an inclusive community attacking and eating itself and the people that it was supposed to be supporting and protecting it really wasn't doing that anymore it started to be obvious that the progressive movement was only really interested in protecting itself people in the progressive campaign are entirely disposable as more and more people are added there always needs to be someone else who's the problem so they keep finding someone who's the new problem I'm seeing new articles were now gay black and Asian men are the new problem and it's silly it's absolutely ridiculous to keep just moving the blame from group to group to group to group in fixing nothing understand sharing a helpful ideology like explaining why you want to protect minority is why you might want to support a certain cause but that's not what's happening what's happening is that no one's teaching anyone anything that's just hateful attacks and shaming while I was slowly losing my liberal faith and not hiding it very much I had many drag queens and weird people come up to me and tell me oh my God thank you for talking about this topic I can't believe people are attacking you for this and I wish more people were talking about it but I can't talk about it because I don't want to be attacked because I don't want to lose my job because I don't want to be ostracized so that's solidified to me what kind of authoritarian takeover has been happening for quite a while in the day community we lost a freedom we lost our voices we lost the ability to take the community and say hey I don't like the direction we're going with this you can't do that anymore it's not in your hands because we're listening to politicians and if we're just listening to politicians then what's the point of any of this why have pride why have gay gay rights marches if it's not really about the people that you're supposed to be protecting why do any of it it's all a sham at the end of the day it ends up being a group of individuals and a close-minded community that stays silent out of fear so that's the story of why I chose to hashtag walk away I'm blessed to have a group of friends who are very tolerant and intelligent I have friends that we don't agree and that's fine and that's how it should be we sit down if we have something that we disagree with we said riah disagree let's have a drink and that's what we need to do in the queer community not attack each other like children I love all of you and I hope this video gets out to the people that it needs so desperately to get to a lot of people feel alone a lot of people feel helpless and if you have the ability and you have the strength to be strong and talked out and say something about it you need to do it and it's the time to do it there's a there's a lot more of us than anyone realizes and when we all come together we can't be shut down we can't be made silent and we will make a change hey Ivy easily make this video an hour two hours long I tend to ramble so I'm going to a little bit of editing to make sure that I am getting some main points I wonder across and so first BAM obviously I'm a drag queen so I wanted to share this video in drag because I want to break some stereotypes about being a drag queen being trans being in the queer community being a minority you don't need to follow a certain set of rules you don't need to follow certain restrictions and in fact this time the opposite of what we're all working towards in terms of getting to a place where we can have self-government and not have to worry about what other people think about us I am someone who is always had been against big corporations big banks rough government unfair policing I was actually in st.

saturation of seeing a lot of progressive people in the same spot has kind of started to show me what's going on I started to notice a lot of people who were extremely intolerant but they said they were the most tolerant people around you had to watch everything you sat around them you know to watch everything you did around them your freedom was pretty much gone and subject to their control there was still a lot of jokes and negativity around but it was basically decided that you needed to direct that at the groups that we don't like why straight says Christian male and as a minority if you didn't join in with that if he didn't join in with attacking those groups so if you said hey maybe we should attack them quite so harshly maybe we should accept people then you kind of lost your minority card so like if you're black they'd say oh why are you white if you're gay you lose your gay card really silly stuff and the weird thing is that can't treat you like you're not on minority anymore like you're part of the problem now which is weird because you are still a minority if you really think about it all these people everyone talking about how they're other how they have concerns about the liberal community is still very much minority and the fact that their voices aren't being respected by the community is a huge red flag and the people they attack they attack with hate and malice and spite and and disturbing comments if you took some of the comments on Twitter and Facebook and you replace the majority groups with minority groups the comments would be obviously disgusting hate speech but they always have some kind of excuse the new definition of racism oh I'm I have I'm a minority I'm a minority so I have a lot of aggression built up oh they had it coming they had their time they were mean to us and I mean be mean to them that wasn't the biggest wake up rose for me scene was supposed to be an inclusive community attacking and eating itself and the people that it was supposed to be supporting and protecting it really wasn't doing that anymore it started to be obvious that the progressive movement was only really interested in protecting itself people in the progressive campaign are entirely disposable as more and more people are added there always needs to be someone else who's the problem so they keep finding someone who's the new problem I'm seeing new articles were now gay black and Asian men are the new problem and it's silly it's absolutely ridiculous to keep just moving the blame from group to group to group to group in fixing nothing understand sharing a helpful ideology like explaining why you want to protect minority is why you might want to support a certain cause but that's not what's happening what's happening is that no one's teaching anyone anything that's just hateful attacks and shaming while I was slowly losing my liberal faith and not hiding it very much I had many drag queens and weird people come up to me and tell me oh my God thank you for talking about this topic I can't believe people are attacking you for this and I wish more people were talking about it but I can't talk about it because I don't want to be attacked because I don't want to lose my job because I don't want to be ostracized so that's solidified to me what kind of authoritarian takeover has been happening for quite a while in the day community we lost a freedom we lost our voices we lost the ability to take the community and say hey I don't like the direction we're going with this you can't do that anymore it's not in your hands because we're listening to politicians and if we're just listening to politicians then what's the point of any of this why have pride why have gay gay rights marches if it's not really about the people that you're supposed to be protecting why do any of it it's all a sham at the end of the day it ends up being a group of individuals and a close-minded community that stays silent out of fear so that's the story of why I chose to hashtag walk away I'm blessed to have a group of friends who are very tolerant and intelligent I have friends that we don't agree and that's fine and that's how it should be we sit down if we have something that we disagree with we said riah disagree let's have a drink and that's what we need to do in the queer community not attack each other like children I love all of you and I hope this video gets out to the people that it needs so desperately to get to a lot of people feel alone a lot of people feel helpless and if you have the ability and you have the strength to be strong and talked out and say something about it you need to do it and it's the time to do it there's a there's a lot more of us than anyone realizes and when we all come together

80,8k-6DFIToIQ,hey y'all um i've been kind of afraid to really speak out and say much about my views over the past few years but in 2016 um i decided to walk away and i've been i've been scared to really at the time i was i was scared to admit that i voted trump in 2016 because i'm i'm gay um and being gay you're not allowed to be conservative or a republican it's um unorthodox but in 2016 i started realizing that the liberal platform really is about taking away fundamental rights i believe in the constitution i believe in the declaration of independence i i believe in the bill of rights it is my right that i have all of these freedoms and the bigger government that the uh liberal side wants like uh universal healthcare gun reform to where they they take and ban guns from us that's that's invoking on my or infringing on my freedoms and liberties that as a citizen i'm given by right and i don't agree with that because a lot of why we broke away from england is because of the infringements that the king of england at the time was putting on us and i just want to show you all something and that is and i'm not going to stand for somebody who wants to take away those rods and that's pretty well the liberal party but this guy right here it says revolutionary and the constitution um that's what i'm going to stand for not right it is my right and my freedoms to make my own decisions about who i do my free trade with i shouldn't be provided it's not a right for me to have health care health care as a service i'm i shouldn't have to pay for yours you shouldn't have to pay for mine we should be responsible for paying our own i can't support the left side any longer because of how many of our undeniable like rights like they want to infringe on i just can't stand for it i can't support it immigration it is my right as a citizen to have these freedoms these freedoms that i am given should not be given to anybody who wants to come to this country illegally there's processes there's ways to come across the border legally whether it's you know right out the gate with immigrating whether it's uh seeking asylum if it's um a student visa a work visa they can come here legally the illegal ones are what's driving up the cost of everything that healthcare is ridiculous now because i'm having to pay just like everybody else for illegals health care costs that's not right not it's not right when obamacare came into play my income my personal income and i'm i know i'm not alone in this was dramatically affected one-fourth of what you make a year is supposed to go to a household today since obamacare one third of my insur or of my pay goes to my benefits the majority of that being my health care one third so far this year i've made i'm gonna i'm just gonna throw that out i was laid off for three months i did not work for uh a while during this pandemic but on a recent pay stub it wasn't the most up to date is probably end of mid july somewhere in there it said that i had grossed 21 000 and given i've been i was out of work for three months so this is just three four months five maybe months worth of income 21 000 gross this year after taxes and insurance and benefits all come out only 13 000 have i netted the majority of it is not taxes it is not 401k the majority of it is healthcare obamacare has put a hindrance on the middle class work in america so much more than it has benefited anybody else that is ridiculous when one-fourth of your income is supposed to go to a home but yet one-third goes to your healthcare one-third let that sink in i can show you the numbers i can't support universal healthcare i can't it's going to cost you and i and everybody else who pays taxes it's going to cost us we're already paying it but we ain't benefiting the left has gone so far left wing like so far they are they're so socially socialist driven today that it don't even meet the standards of being a democracy the more they get in power the more rights we're going to lose the more of our freedoms we're going to lose and that's not what my ancestors fought for and i showed you my ancestors rock it said revolutionary war that i just learned that this year i did not know i had an ancestor who fought in a revolutionary war but knowing that today makes me even believe even stronger in the conservative side in the smaller government and protecting our freedoms because he fought for those he fought for the rights my sixth time great grandfather fought for those rights that you and i enjoy and that's all the liberal side wants to is encourage on them and remove them and take them away from us and we cannot stand for that no one should be standing for any of that,"Hey y'all um, I've been kind of afraid to really speak out and say much about my views over the past few years, but in 2016 um I decided to walk away and I've been I've been scared to really at the time I was. I was scared to admit that I voted trump in 2016, because I'm I'm gay, um and being gay you're not allowed to be conservative or a republican, it's um unorthodox, but in 2016 I started realizing that the liberal platform really is about taking away fundamental rights. I believe in the constitution, I believe in the declaration of independence. I I believe in the bill of rights. It is my right that I have all of these freedoms and the bigger government that the uh liberal side wants, like uh universal healthcare gun reform to where they they take and ban guns from us. That's that's invoking on my or infringing on my freedoms and liberties, that as a citizen I'm given by right- and I don't agree with that- because a lot of why we broke away from england is because of the infringements that the king of england at the time was putting on us, and I just want to show you all something, and that is- and I'm not going to stand for somebody who wants to take away those rods and that's pretty well the liberal party, but this guy right here it says revolutionary and the constitution um. That's what I'm going to stand for, not right. It is my right and my freedoms to make my own decisions about who I do my free trade with. I shouldn't be, provided it's not a right for me to have health care health care as a service. I'm I shouldn't have to pay for yours. You shouldn't have to pay for mine. We should be responsible for paying our own. I can't support the left side any longer because of how many of our undeniable like rights like they want to infringe on. I just can't stand for it. I can't support it immigration. It is my right as a citizen to have these freedoms. These freedoms that I am given should not be given to anybody who wants to come to this country illegally. There's processes there's ways to come across the border legally, whether it's you know right out the gate with immigrating, whether it's uh seeking asylum. If it's um a student visa, a work visa, they can come here legally, the illegal ones are what's driving up the cost of everything that healthcare is ridiculous. Now, because I'm having to pay just like everybody else for illegals, health care costs, that's not right, not it's not right! When obamacare came into play my income, my personal income and I'm- I know I'm not alone in this- was dramatically affected. One-Fourth of what you make a year is supposed to go to a household today since obamacare, one third of my insur or of my pay, goes to my benefits, the majority of that being my health care one. Third, so far this year, I've made I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, throw that out. I was laid off for three months. I did not work for uh a while during this pandemic, but on a recent pay stub it wasn't. The most up to date is probably end of mid july somewhere in there. It said that I had grossed 21 000 and given I've been, I was out of work for three months, so this is just three four months: five, maybe months worth of income, 21 000 gross this year after taxes and insurance and benefits all come out only 13 000. Have I netted the majority of it is not taxes, it is not 401k. The majority of it is healthcare. Obamacare has put a hindrance on the middle class work in america, so much more than it has benefited anybody else. That is ridiculous when one-fourth of your income is supposed to go to a home, but yet one-third goes to your healthcare one-third. Let that sink in. I can show you the numbers. I can't support universal healthcare. I can't it's going to cost you and I and everybody else who pays taxes. It's going to cost us we're already paying it, but we ain't benefiting the left has gone so far. Left wing like so far, they are they're so socially socialist, driven today that it don't even meet the standards of being a democracy, the more they get in power, the more rights we're going to lose, the more of our freedoms, we're going to lose, and that's not what my ancestors fought for, and I showed you my ancestors rock. It said revolutionary war that I just learned that this year I did not know, I had an ancestor who fought in a revolutionary war, but knowing that today makes me even believe even stronger in the conservative side in the smaller government and protecting our freedoms, because he fought for those he fought for the rights. My sixth time, great grandfather fought for those rights that you and I enjoy, and that's all the liberal side wants to is encourage on them and remove them and take them away from us, and we cannot stand for that. No one should be standing for any of that."
81,8vz2iiORlVU,hi walk away movement I'm Sabrina and this is kind of my little walk away story whatever I can't say that I was I don't know when I was younger you know I voted for Clinton I really liked what he said things he did I felt he did really good for the economy I didn't really care what was going on with all the sexual bedroom stuff that was between him and his wife and then came Bush and I liked him so I voted for him and then he fast-forward up to Obama and I didn't like him uh I didn't know anything about him I felt that he wasn't qualified enough that he didn't have enough experience I didn't even think about him being black or white because he was mixed you know white mama raised by his white mama and I didn't like him some about him and when he talked I felt like a used car salesman talking or something and I'd get the little hairs on the back of my neck stand up so you know I was like hmm I'm not voting for him I don't know much about him I I just I didn't like him and I didn't really like I think it was what McCain or something that was running I didn't care for him either and but I did like Sarah Palin and so I went that direction cuz I liked heard the Bulldog mom you know I related to her the issues that she had you know she lived a real life and that was me so that's the way I had voted well my daughter who is probably won't very one of the least racist persons I've ever right she had black friends many of them okay with the houses she went to their house who they hug out dated black guys she I guess her friends have found out I wasn't voting for Obama and they decided they couldn't be friends with her no more brought the bus home the wrong bus home several of them got off at her bus stop and proceeded to jump her I ended up having to take her to the emergency room they broke her nose busted her eyes up nothing like deadly serious or anything but it was enough for me to step back whoa what what why you know these are your friends they know you're not racist and that's when I noticed the divide start happening right then it was like I watched people who had been friends for 20 years you know become unfriend because you're racist all of a sudden you don't like Obama you're racist oh you're racist you know like Obama oh you're right it was like a nine stop thing and he hadn't even been elected yet and it was already starting fast-forward through his um presidency the first term I just I saw it the divide was I've never seen it so bad you know of course I'm not old enough to have been back in those days but for my life I had never seen racism come out so badly as it was becoming you know everybody was racist all of a sudden and you know I was watching my country become tore apart so come the second time I was like I am definitely not voting for this guy you know I I didn't like him didn't like him nails on a chalkboard when he talked I couldn't watch him I'm watching the debates on the second time and every time he talked I could just cringe and don't get me wrong because they didn't like the other two either but of course I voted the other two because at least their beliefs were more in standing with mine in at the time I was very angry with Obama for the divide that was happening in our country so then you fast forward you know to the Trump saying he he's gonna run well I've always liked Trump and if you know anything about trunk he leaned more democratic anyways he only ran Republican because that was the ticket he had to have to run on because you know they were already going for Hillary on the Democrat side but I liked him I've always liked him when I was younger and I was taking a psychology course we had to do a paper on Sam Walton and Trump and the differences and how they were raised and how they did their businesses all this stuff so I had to research both of them and I found Trump to be very generous he was he's very generous he does a lot of behind the scene things that you don't even know about and then you know he was always with people like Oprah you know him an Oprah really good friends and this is a black woman and he was friends with a lot of black people that are out there in the public eye right now that hate him but they were friends and loved him and loved the money he gave to their causes and you know things he helped them do and I blame Obama for the racism stuff I just I really blame Obama for the racism stuff but anyways I'm sorry I got off-track this is a man who has put his life on hold to come in and help America to become what it once was you know the the land of the free you know you used to always hear those things where people say you know 2.5 kids white picket fences the American Dream you no that's been caught a long time people have been struggling for a very long time and here he comes and he's like I'm gonna fix this I'm gonna fix this and he's been trying and he's done a lot so far but he could only do so much without the Congress and the Senate's help I guess people don't understand that oh you can just write executive orders but that's not what he wants he wants us to come together as a unit yes he's harsh yes he says things that but that's who he is what you see is what you get and he that's who he is but he is not racist and I'm watching how our Democratic Party has just I mean they they've gone too far they are you've got homeless people living in tent cities all across the country you've got what do they say one in five children go to bed hungry at night you know we have all these issues right here we have like my parents who are finding it very difficult now that they're retired to get because they're not at the age for Medicare yet or whatever to get insurance and you hear them go oh well we'll just give illegals insurance for free and I'm going whoa my mother and father have worked their entire lives entire lives paid in their entire lives and they can't get free health insurance but you're just gonna give people come across the border come get you some free health insurance you know they're more worried about taking care of all of them than they are the people right here you know their abortion stuff is too far left for me they're just I look in their ideology is just not with my values anymore and not only that they've gone so far to the other side it's I don't know what's happening in my country and I cry and I pray and it worries me and it stresses me you know I am raising two white conservative boys and I fear for them because of the rhetoric on the other side you know I fear for them their lives being in jeopardy over this so I've been on walk away for a year now and I never said anything or wrote anything I've just watched and read and Brandon I love what you're doing I love what you stand for you you don't stand for like Republican conservative Democrat liberal you stand for people you know and you you stand for thinking on your own and you stand for the fact that we can all be different and have different ideas and it's not [Music],"Hi walk away movement, I'm Sabrina, and this is kind of my little walk away story. Whatever I can't say that I was I, don't know when I was younger. You know, I voted for Clinton I, really liked what he said things he did. I felt he did really good for the economy. I didn't really care what was going on with all the sexual bedroom stuff, that was between him and his wife and then came Bush and I liked him. So I voted for him and then he fast-forward up to Obama and I. Didn't like him, uh I, didn't know anything about him. I felt that he wasn't qualified enough, that he didn't have enough experience. I didn't even think about him being black or white because he was mixed. You know white mama raised by his white mama and I, didn't like him, some about him and when he talked I felt like a used car salesman talking or something and I'd get the little hairs on the back of my neck stand up. So you know, I was like hmm I'm, not voting for him. I, don't know much about him. I I! Just I didn't like him and I didn't really like I think it was what McCain or something that was running. I didn't care for him either and but I did like Sarah, Palin and so I went that direction. Cuz I liked heard the Bulldog mom. You know I related to her the issues that she had. You know she lived a real life, and that was me. So that's the way I had voted well, my daughter, who is probably won't very one of the least racist persons I've ever right. She had black friends, many of them. Okay with the houses she went to their house who they hug out, dated black guys. She I guess her friends have found out, I wasn't voting for Obama and they decided they couldn't be friends with her. No more brought the bus home the wrong bus home. Several of them got off at her bus stop and proceeded to jump. Her I ended up having to take her to the emergency room. They broke her nose, busted her eyes up, nothing like deadly serious or anything, but it was enough for me to step back whoa what what why you know. These are your friends. They know you're, not racist and that's when I noticed the divide start happening right. Then it was like I watched people who had been friends for 20 years. You know become unfriend because you're racist all of a sudden, you don't like Obama you're racist, oh you're, racist. You know like Obama, oh you're, right. It was like a nine stop thing and he hadn't even been elected yet, and it was already starting fast-forward through his um presidency. The first term I just I, saw it. The divide was I've, never seen it so bad. You know, of course, I'm not old enough to have been back in those days, but for my life, I had never seen racism come out so badly as it was becoming. You know, everybody was racist. All of a sudden and you know, I was watching my country become tore apart, so come the second time I was like I am definitely not voting for this guy. You know I I didn't like him, didn't like him nails on a chalkboard when he talked I couldn't watch him I'm watching the debates on the second time and every time he talked I could just cringe and don't get me wrong because they didn't, like the other two either, but of course, I voted the other two, because at least their beliefs were more in standing with mine in at the time, I was very angry with Obama for the divide that was happening in our country. So then you fast forward. You know to the Trump saying he he's gonna run well, I've always liked Trump, and if you know anything about trunk, he leaned more democratic anyways. He only ran Republican, because that was the ticket he had to have to run on, because you know they were already going for Hillary on the Democrat side, but I liked him I've, always liked him. When I was younger and I was taking a psychology course. We had to do a paper on Sam, Walton and Trump and the differences and how they were raised and how they did their businesses all this stuff. So I had to research, both of them and I found Trump to be very generous. He was he's very generous. He does a lot of behind the scene, things that you don't even know about, and then you know he was always with people like Oprah. You know him an Oprah, really good friends, and this is a black woman and he was friends with a lot of black people that are out there in the public eye right now that hate him, but they were friends and loved him and loved the money he gave to their causes, and you know things he helped them do and I blame Obama for the racism stuff, I, just I, really blame Obama for the racism stuff, but anyways I'm, sorry I got off-track. This is a man who has put his life on hold to come in and help America to become what it once was. You know the the land of the free. You know you used to always hear those things where people say you know: 2.5, kids, white, picket fences, the American Dream, you no that's been caught a long time. People have been struggling for a very long time, and here he comes and he's like. I'm gonna fix this I'm gonna fix this and he's been trying and he's done a lot so far, but he could only do so much without the Congress and the Senate's help I. Guess people don't understand that. Oh you can just write executive orders, but that's not what he wants. He wants us to come together as a unit. Yes he's harsh! Yes, he says things that, but that's who he is. What you see is what you get and he that's who he is, but he is not racist and I'm watching how our Democratic Party has just I mean they they've gone too far. They are you've got homeless people living in tent cities all across the country. You've got what do they say? One in five children go to bed hungry at night. You know we have all these issues right here. We have like my parents, who are finding it very difficult now that they're retired to get because they're not at the age for Medicare yet or whatever, to get insurance, and you hear them go. Oh well, we'll just give illegals insurance for free and I'm going whoa. My mother and father have worked their entire lives, entire lives paid in their entire lives and they can't get free health insurance, but you're just gonna give people come across the border. Come get you some free health insurance. You know they're more worried about taking care of all of them than they are the people right here. You know their abortion stuff is too far left for me, they're just I. Look in their ideology is just not with my values anymore and not only that they've gone so far to the other side. It's I, don't know what's happening in my country and I cry and I pray, and it worries me and it stresses me, you know: I am raising two white conservative boys and I fear for them because of the rhetoric on the other side, you know I fear for them their lives being in jeopardy. Over this, so I've been on, walk away for a year now and I, never said anything or wrote anything I've just watched and read and Brandon I love what you're doing I love. What you stand for you, you don't stand for. Like Republican, conservative, Democrat liberal, you stand for people, you know and you you stand for thinking on your own and you stand for the fact that we can all be different and have different ideas and it's not [Music]."

Big risk are involved right. Let's learn it from Carnegie can be like you know, it's big risk being independent thinker, I mean for a free thinker, and you can keep being you just keeping you and you'll be fine right anyway. I voted for Donald Trump, 2016 primaries. I'm, not gonna lie I'm vote for my despite nothing because I agree with his politics or him in general. Anything sort I am voting for Donald Trump, because I thought funny sanders and funny. Sanders got screwed screwed on the Democratic primary. Therefore I wasn't there was absolutely no way. I was gonna vote for Hillary Clinton. Now what I didn't pop a little concerned, I expressed I was gonna vote for Donald Trump I was Bosch. Prices are a bit of a light way of putting it I people. My inbox for days, calling me all this Uncle Tom sellout, yeah, yeah, yeah, I dunno. That affects me right away. I I don't give a I, don't care whatever. You call me in the face with uh we face with our messages in the I'm friend like a female okay, yeah yeah, get it out, I understand getting that wage out. That way to haul out trust me I, get it and I'm going to be man anyway. What I know I know it's a bit of shift down from when the election, the one strike you down something the election. I certainly did it, but we almost a bit of a seismic shift with Donald Trump what presidential election and that's when the madness began, though I will admit, are those a little bit US Capitol bit of us. You know me being skeptical after off y'all Occupy, Wall, Street I, said initially when I start off with my eyes, watered down stuff that people started to start doing in the Democratic Party and the pandering in August just dump dump stuff, but um I first started to walk away the minute literally the day after the dump, someone presidency I, remember: I, remember specifically the Democrats going on and on on about my own election. Luckily reactors it'll be a fun election. This and, like you know, I wish is acceptable, wins to win and they were. They were specifically saying this for the Trump supporters. By the way they exactly I'm. Trying even is I, can try and support this for themselves because that's exactly needs here after election, but they immediately immediately start going on and on about how the Russians allow how to hack the election won. The fair election she's got the popular vote as if the electoral vote isn't the main [ __ ] thing um, it was a real plus. There wasn't it it was. It was such a little getting this stuff I'm like wow wow, wait what is happening right now. What is like a Wyatt like? Why? Are they self imploding like this, like it's such an obvious self implosion I can't even comprehend it, and now we got these fake news going on right. We got that Democrats are refusing to take responsibility for anything. Really, the kid can take control their states, the can take control their people, they refused survive. Bylaws I eat immigration, it's mass madness, it's mass madness! Everyone I can't believe the last two years of had we had a greater economy. Black a black unemployment is down. I, know P, but I couldn't get a job. They have. They have great jobs. Now in the black community, because I they're opening up the steel mills over here in the Midwest they're bringing back jobs from overseas, the trade deals are very promising. They're showing every other country that we're not gonna be stepped on. America has never seen such a promising future, and yet they get stepped on, get squashed every day by the media. Why? Why cuz a good, because this guy that you don't like it I like it- is that why you want America, then flow right now, cuz, you don't like them. We got bricks. We got our UK trying to uh new Trump blooms, embarrassing Trump blooms of him being a baby. This embarrassing yourself, I, don't understand how any adult can support that and like just not be embarrassed automatically run for by by just like standing next to it. I really do not get a picture with me. In a backdrop alone. This is ridiculous. I want absolutely nothing to do with it. Come on now come on weirdos we got come on really guys like it was just madness man, and then we got all these silly silly protests and trust me I'm. A big supporter of the protest, but you gotta know how to protest. You gotta understand you, do a protest about anywhere about anything. I get that, but you gotta know exactly our protest when you protest without meaning you sort of make the calls of like a little cause of fraudulent, and you make yourselves like idiots, don't you like when you protest when you make a protest for illegal immigrants and you don't acknowledge the fact that they broke the law, you kind of pick yourself like a [ __ ], because I didn't like the Republicans, are gonna post videos of Obama, saying that he supports getting rid of illegal immigrants in America like and they're gonna win, because, like that, you supported it. When Obama did it, why don't you support it? Now you sound ridiculous. You sound like hypocrites. I can go on and on don't even make I can go on about fake news all day. Does the fake news, the fake news didn't do it the fake news and turn me off from Democrats come on like that? Did it that's a good pun, so I was like I was still like kind of leaning, liberal, not one I was still leaning like I and maybe like they can give me back until they start doing all this like. Oh all, the Trump news on anti Trump news is fake. News and stuff is absolutely ridiculous and it's all article saying that Trump is forgetting Hillary, which was yes, just just just fantastic, because they're finally admitting that Hillary Clinton is a dirty dirty rat. They wouldn't really admit it within the last three years. But now, like you know now that Hillary Clinton is off the radar they. Why do you feel safer to actually admit I would feel defensive, - use of fraudulent scammer. This way, hey better than Trump craziness, guys its mass madness just walk away. Anyone watching this video right now, don't listen to me right, I'm, just giving you my first-hand experience of what made me walk away. But anyone like do your research on it. Do your research, don't least follow anything the dead, they're saying right, they're calling us Russian box now by anyone that ain't was doing the hashtag Walker would not like a Russian bot got ah do I like a big potato vodka, no I'm, not a Russian, but CNN, alright, I'm walking away! You made me walk away, I pack, my bags getting on that plane country roads. Take me home right. Take me Tennessee I, don't go I'm off I'm, walking away right here, oh good anyway, hello! There I'm Ross I'm here to happily report that we have left the Democratic plantation. We are off the plantation hashtag, walk away. Everyone and our one wasn't happy to appoint it I'm for a start or address our black people. That may be watching my video skeptically I. Thank you for your view. I do want to say, even if you have, even if your opinions lined up for one of the things that I say, don't let other black people put you down for agreeing for her agreeing with something that no black people do normally agree with you gotta be on plastic gotta, be on, didn't, think. I know it's a little hard when you talk down to humiliated and guilt trips and to believe in something you really don't believe in don't believe in, but part of being an independent thinker being risk is the risk. Big risk are involved right. Let's learn it from Carnegie can be like you know, it's big risk being independent thinker, I mean for a free thinker, and you can keep being you just keeping you and you'll be fine right anyway. I voted for Donald, Trump 2016 primaries. I'm, not gonna lie I'm vote for my despite nothing because I agree with his politics or him in general. Anything sort I am voting for Donald Trump, because I thought funny sanders and funny. Sanders got screwed screwed on the Democratic primary. Therefore I wasn't there was absolutely no way. I was gonna vote for Hillary Clinton. Now what I didn't pop a little concerned, I expressed I was gonna vote for Donald Trump I was Bosch. Prices are a bit of a light way of putting it I people. My inbox for days, calling me all this Uncle Tom sellout yeah, yeah, yeah, I dunno. That affects me right away: I I, don't give a I, don't care whatever. You call me in the face with uh we face with our messages in the I'm friend like a female okay, yeah yeah, get it out, I understand getting that wage out. That way to haul out trust me I, get it and I'm going to be man anyway. What I know I know it's a bit of shift down from when the election, the one strike you down something the election. I certainly did it, but we almost a bit of a seismic shift with Donald Trump what presidential election and that's when the madness began, though I will admit, are those a little bit US Capitol bit of us. You know me being skeptical after off y'all Occupy, Wall, Street I, said initially when I start off with my eyes, watered down stuff that people started to start doing in the Democratic Party and the pandering in August just dump dump stuff, but um I first started to walk away the minute literally the day after the dump, someone presidency I, remember, I, remember specifically the Democrats going on and on on about my own election. Luckily reactors it'll be a fun election. This and, like you know, I wish is acceptable, wins to win and they were. They were specifically saying this for the Trump supporters. By the way they exactly I'm. Trying even is I, can try and support this for themselves, because that's exactly needs here after election, but they immediately immediately start going on and on about how the Russians allow how to hack the election won. The fair election she's got the popular vote as if the electoral vote isn't the main [ __ ] thing um, it was a real plus. There wasn't it it was. It was such a little getting this stuff I'm like wow wow, wait what is happening right now. What is like a Wyatt like? Why are they self imploding like this, like it's such an obvious self implosion I can't even comprehend it, and now we got these fake news going on right. We got that Democrats are refusing to take responsibility for anything. Really, the kid can take control their states, the can take control their people, they refused survive. Bylaws I eat immigration, it's mass madness, it's mass madness! Everyone I can't believe the last two years of had we had a greater economy. Black a black unemployment is down. I, know P, but I couldn't get a job. They have. They have great jobs now in the black community, because I they're opening up the steel mills over here in the Midwest they're bringing back jobs from overseas. The trade deals are very promising.

83,9N86_BIphN8,walkawayers my name is brooke lesher and i have grown up in the south to start off i guess i should say i'm probably what you would call a combination of a walk with and a walkawayer because my journey to walk away started way way back in the late 90s early thousands when i was studying for my first bachelor's degree i was at one of my local colleges where i'd chosen to go to school from an early age and i was studying journalism at the time one of my instructors one day was teaching us about the quote unquote big five and that was the point that i learned that 93 of the world's news media outlets are owned by five companies this was where i learned that you will never see anything that is not family friendly on abc because they are owned by disney this will come into play much later on after hillary got the nomination anyway during my time at the university one of the requirements in my department was that you had to do an internship well it just so happened that my internship was to take place in 2000 2000 if you guys will recall was the election where the supreme court eventually had to decide that george bush won the election because it was too close to call well my internship was with al gore's presidential campaign in 2000 i worked in the communications area which is just a fancy word for saying that i worked in the mail room i was a hardcore democrat at that time of course because i grew up in a family full of democrats my grandmother was into local politics here in the county that i now live as a school teacher because we lived in tennessee she worked pretty heavily with the gore family she actually received an invitation to the inauguration after clinton was elected which would have been really exciting if we could have gotten a hotel room but anyway so i went to work for al gore's campaign at the campaign headquarters in nashville so that was where i first got my my insider's view on how politics works because the dnc headquarters were there in the building where i was working the first thing that i saw that i that just struck me as being odd was i would see members of the public come through the door right next to my office in the mailroom with stacks and stacks of bush signs in their hands and i couldn't figure out why i mean they would disappear around the corner and i was busy doing my work so it didn't occur to me to ask where they were going or what they were doing it just so happened that i found out from my supervisor one day i kind of often mentioned seeing a guy come in with a stack like like this of signs and i said why are we bringing bush signs into the building and she left she said oh you don't know about the bonus program and i said what bonus program and she said we pay members of the public 25 cents a sign and i was like are you kidding they're going into people's yards and taking their signs to bring them in to get paid and she left and she said yeah i mean we don't want people to to know that there are people in nashville that are voting for bush and i was like that doesn't quite pass the smell test shall we say i mean i was i was probably let's see i was 18 when i voted for clinton the first time so by that point in time i had already voted for clinton twice and was very excited at the prospect of being able to vote for al gore because he would have been the third election that i had voted in by that point because i spent 10 years studying for my first bachelor's degree so i'm like nearing the the very end at that point so i'm kind of watching the way that the campaign is being run i reached the point where i became so jaded working in the mail room my job in the mail room was to open up letters figure out what subject the person was writing about and then we had little baskets scattered around the room for letters where we would take the envelope and staple it to the back of the letter if it had the person's return address on it if you wrote a letter to al gore in 2000 and received a form letter chances are good i was the person that put your name and address in the database to have a letter sent to you so that was my job well you can imagine along with letters people also mailed checks and it was at that point that i learned if the check is up to a certain amount staple the check to the letter and put it in this basket over here but if the check is over this amount which of course i didn't realize was the limit to how much a person could write a check for to donate to a campaign i was to take the check and the letter in hand to al gore's war room and pass it off to a member of their staff i'll get more into that later on but anyway i reached the point where i did not watch the news anymore because i knew every time we made a mistake because we would get an influx of letters telling us exactly why we made a mistake i tracked how well the campaign was doing from the number of letters that we got in my mail room every week so you can imagine as the election progressed it's getting closer to election time they brought all of us in communications together and explain that after a certain day we wouldn't be sending out any more letters because they wanted to make sure that the letters got to people before election day not an uncommon practice but instead of putting people's names in the computer like that was my normal job the last two weeks of the campaign because i wasn't sending out letters anymore they brought me with a chair and a shredder they sat me down in the big open area where the where the campaign office was and explained to me that i was going to be shredding documents for the campaign because i had to do something i mean i was i was already there so they brought a box like big box of letters set them down next to me and told me run these through the shredder when it when the bag is full take it off put it off to the side here's another bag so on and so forth so i'm thinking okay that's fine until i start looking at the letters most if not all the letters that i was shredding were in regards to those those checks that i had to take to the war room because they were more than people were supposed to be able to donate they had me shredding evidence that people had mailed checks at that point i realized quickly you know what it's always the little guy that gets sent to leavenworth and i'm just saying they just assume that i'm a stupid intern that's not going to know that i'm essentially being asked to cover up illegal activity that was the first moment the very first moment the second was when donna brazile let all of us interns people that were that were basically working for free because we were college students that we were that we were going to be required to work 40 hours a week in the weeks leading up to the election or they would not sign off on our hours for college i ended up being on school suspension for a year after that because my grades fell through the floor because i had to skip classes every day for like two weeks because of this so yeah no love lost especially not now that she's on fox anyway skipping on ahead that was when i learned studying to be a member of the news media we were trained to write articles at an eighth grade understanding level that was my first time really realizing that the news media assumes that the people that they're writing for have a distinct lack of intelligence i knew my family members people that that were hardcore democrats that deserve so much better than the way they were treated but even then i still continue to vote democrat i voted democrat every election until 2016. my husband and i have been married for 12 years he he was with me i mean he had voted democrat pretty much all his life up until the point that we moved back to texas my husband is originally from texas and in 2010 my husband and i moved from tennessee all the way down to texas that was where i first started to really get into politics so we were kind of watching and i knew that i didn't like hillary because of how badly she had treated the women that had accused her husband of sexual assault i'm not talking about monica i'm talking about the others the one that trump had the ones that trump had at that press conference right after the access hollywood tape came out so i knew that i couldn't vote for her because she used every ounce of political capital she had to bury those women and then had the audacity to claim that she and the democrats were the party of women i was like no when i was working for gore's campaign i was very impressed with john mccain not a popular opinion at the campaign headquarters as you can imagine until he chose sarah palin for his running mate and i knew the reason that he chose her was because he was trying to appeal to women and that was the first time that i ever thought i am not going to vote for you just because you chose a woman to be your running mate i'm not going to vote for somebody just because she's a woman she has to be qualified she has to have views that i agree with so when hillary's entire campaign centered around the fact that it was her turn and that she just she gave off the air of somebody that just believed that it was her turn and i'm thinking to myself you're gonna have to give me more than just the fact that i should vote to not betray my gender something of course that i was told after the campaign and his election so we were still living in texas preparing to move back to tennessee when the primary happened in 2016. my husband voted for marco rubio i voted for bernie because i was still on the democrat side but knew that i couldn't stomach voting for her so i voted for him because i liked a lot of his ideas having not really a lot of understanding about how they would get paid for that was my first mistake but anyway so after the primary when trump got the nomination that was when the media completely lost their minds but i think the true moment when i finally just said you know what never again was when hillary came out and called half of trump supporters she could put them in a basket of deplorables and i'm thinking to myself let's be real you don't mean half of us you mean all of us all of us that didn't vote for you all of us that disagree with you all of us in the flyover states one of my favorite favorite videos to watch from election night is the young turks because it's it epitomizes the disdain that people have for people that come from states like mine if you don't live on the coast or you're not part of the coastal elites they have no use for you at all i mean i watch the news okay i'll give you a good example something that i learned from from studying for my degree in journalism on inauguration day they had well first they had the pictures of the empty the empty spaces where they claim that nobody showed up for the inauguration which i knew was a load of crap because one of my local organizations said that there were people turned away at the gate because there were so many people so i knew that was a lie immediately but then i watched them disparage donald for when he and melania came down in the car where they were supposed to meet with the obamas for breakfast they criticized donald for jumping out of the car and leaving melania behind but the video that they shot cut off at a certain point so i did some searching and i looked for the video that the rest of it because i knew from the abruptness of the way they cut it off that there was something we weren't supposed to see sure enough it's donald rushing ahead while the driver opens the door from melania so that he can run up and open the door for the obamas in a sign of respect they cut that part off of the video to show that he's a misogynist that leaves his wife behind he's a racist two of his wives are immigrants for god's sake you know i grew up around democrats i always thought that the republicans were the racists until i learned after doing some research that the republican party was founded to eliminate slavery that was the purpose for the entire republican party being founded in the first place but then i started getting arguments from people that i worked with saying yeah but that was so long ago and i'm like well how about the voting rights act of 64. is that close enough for you and they were like what do you mean i said the democrats voted unanimously against that hillary raised barry goldwater and margaret sanger i can't begin to tell you how shocked i was when i found the video of her talking about eliminating the numbers in the black community and then i started to think all the planned parenthoods in the areas where i grew up are in the poor areas why do we think that is are we trying to get rid of people that we think are a drain on society are you kidding me but sure i'm the racist are you kidding so there's that there's the open disdain that the entire democrat establishment has held and the media who i view is nothing more than a than a bunch of propagandists for the democratic party so these are just some of the many many many reasons that i chose to walk away i went from being an absolute vehement liberal all my life to taking that red pill in the fall of 2016 unless they fix the the links that they've fallen down i will never vote democrat again 2016 was the first time that i had ever voted straight party all the way down before that i was a person that would vote for the person whether they were republican or democrat i kind of tended to think of myself as a modder kind of a moderate i have family friends that have all turned their backs on me because they think that i am against gay people because i voted for donald trump i believe that every person deserves the right to be happy and the right to have their voices heard in fact on election night they scheduled me to close at the store that i was working at when the return started to come in every person that i worked with at that store voted democrat i was like maybe one of maybe three people that didn't i sat and held their hands when they cried because i remember standing in the legislative plaza in nashville when gore lost until two in the morning when he had his campaign manager come down to tell us to go home you can imagine when hillary didn't address her supporters after the election i was like well that looks familiar stop showing disdain for the people that that give their blood sweat and tears to you trying to use every nasty trick that you can pull to accomplish your goals stop clinging to power with with all your bony fingers you have to recognize the people that put you there in the first place and i don't think the democratic party at this point does that i have found so much love and acceptance in this group when i found your video brandon it was a lifesaver thank you so much hashtag walk away,"Walkawayers,

She actually received an invitation to the inauguration after clinton was elected, which would have been really exciting if we could have gotten a hotel room, but anyway, so I went to work for al gore's campaign at the campaign headquarters in nashville, so that was where I first got my my insider's view on how politics works, because the dnc headquarters were there in the building where I was working. The first thing that I saw that I that just struck me as being odd was, I would see members of the public come through the door right next to my office in the mailroom with stacks and stacks of bush signs in their hands, and I couldn't figure out why I mean they would disappear around the corner and I was busy doing my work, so it didn't occur to me to ask where they were going or what they were doing. It just so happened that I found out from my supervisor one day I kind of often mentioned seeing a guy come in with a stack like like this of signs, and I said why are we bringing bush signs into the building and she left? She said. Oh, you don't know about the bonus program and I said what bonus program and she said we pay members of the public, 25 cents a sign and I was like. Are you kidding they're going into people's yards and taking their signs to bring them in to get paid? And she left and she said yeah I mean we don't want people to to know that there are people in nashville that are voting for bush and I was like that doesn't quite pass the smell test. Shall we say I mean I was I was probably let's see I was 18 when I voted for clinton the first time so by that point in time I had already voted for clinton twice and was very excited at the prospect of being able to vote for al gore because he would have been the third election that I had voted in by that point, because I spent 10 years studying for my first bachelor's degree. So I'm like nearing the the very end at that point, so I'm kind of watching the way that the campaign is being run. I reached the point where I became so jaded working in the mail room. My job in the mail room was to open up letters figure out what subject the person was writing about, and then we had little baskets scattered around the room for letters where we would take the envelope and staple it to the back of the letter if it had the person's return address on it. If you wrote a letter to al gore in 2000 and received a form letter, chances are good. I was the person that put your name and address in the database to have a letter sent to you. So that was my job. Well, you can imagine, along with letters, people also mailed checks, and it was at that point that I learned if the check is up to a certain amount, staple the check to the letter and put it in this basket over here. But if the check is over this amount, which of course I didn't realize, was the limit to how much a person could write a check for to donate to a campaign. I was to take the check and the letter in hand to al gore's war room and pass it off to a member of their staff I'll get more into that later on. But anyway, I reached the point where I did not watch the news anymore, because I knew every time we made a mistake, because we would get an influx of letters telling us exactly why we made a mistake. I tracked how well the campaign was doing from the number of letters that we got in my mail room every week, so you can imagine, as the election progressed it's getting closer to election time, they brought all of us in communications together and explain that after a certain day, we wouldn't be sending out any more letters because they wanted to make sure that the letters got to people before election day, not an uncommon practice, but instead of putting people's names in the computer, like that was my normal job. The last two weeks of the campaign, because I wasn't sending out letters anymore. They brought me with a chair and a shredder. They sat me down in the big open area where the where the campaign office was and explained to me that I was going to be shredding documents for the campaign, because I had to do something I mean I was. I was already there, so they brought a box like big box of letters set them down next to me and told me run these through the shredder when it when the bag is full, take it off, put it off to the side, here's another bag so on and so forth. So I'm thinking! Okay, that's fine! Until I start looking at the letters most, if not all the letters that I was shredding were in regards to those those checks that I had to take to the war room because they were more than people were supposed to be able to donate. They had me shredding evidence that people had mailed checks. At that point, I realized quickly. You know what it's always the little guy that gets sent to leavenworth and I'm just saying they just assume that I'm a stupid intern, that's not going to know that I'm essentially being asked to cover up illegal activity. That was the first moment the very first moment. The second was when donna brazile, let all of us interns people that were that were basically working for free, because we were college students that we were that we were going to be required to work 40 hours a week in the weeks leading up to the election, or they would not sign off on our hours for college. I ended up being on school suspension for a year after that, because my grades fell through the floor because I had to skip classes every day for like two weeks because of this, so yeah no love lost, especially not now that she's on fox anyway skipping on ahead. That was when I learned studying to be a member of the news media. We were trained to write articles at an eighth grade, understanding level. That was my first time really realizing that the news media assumes that the people that they're writing for have a distinct lack of intelligence. I knew my family members, people that that were hardcore democrats that deserve so much better than the way they were treated. But even then I still continue to vote democrat. I voted democrat every election until 2016. my husband and I have been married for 12 years. He he was with me. I mean he had voted democrat, pretty much all his life up until the point that we moved back to texas. My husband is originally from texas and in 2010 my husband and I moved from tennessee all the way down to texas. That was where I first started to really get into politics, so we were kind of watching, and I knew that I didn't like hillary because of how badly she had treated the women that had accused her husband of sexual assault. I'm not talking about monica I'm talking about the others, the one that trump had the ones that trump had at that press conference right after the access hollywood tape came out. So I knew that I couldn't vote for her because she used every ounce of political capital. She had to bury those women and then had the audacity to claim that she and the democrats were the party of women. I was like no. When I was working for gore's campaign, I was very impressed with john mccain, not a popular opinion at the campaign headquarters, as you can imagine until he chose sarah palin for his running mate, and I knew the reason that he chose her was because he was trying to appeal to women, and that was the first time that I ever thought. I am not going to vote for you just because you chose a woman to be your running mate. I'm not going to vote for somebody just because she's a woman she has to be qualified. She has to have views that I agree with so when hillary's entire campaign centered around the fact that it was her turn and that she just she gave off the air of somebody that just believed that it was her turn and I'm thinking to myself. You're gonna have to give me more than just the fact that I should vote to not betray my gender, something of course, that I was told after the campaign and his election, so we were still living in texas preparing to move back to tennessee when the primary happened in 2016.. My husband voted for marco rubio. I voted for bernie because I was still on the democrat side but knew that I couldn't stomach voting for her. So I voted for him because I liked a lot of his ideas, having not really a lot of understanding about how they would get paid, for that was my first mistake, but anyway, so after the primary, when trump got the nomination, that was when the media completely lost their minds, but I think the true moment when I finally just said you know what never again was when hillary came out and called half of trump supporters. She could put them in a basket of deplorables and I'm thinking to myself. Let's be real, you don't mean half of us. You mean all of us all of us that didn't vote for you all of us that disagree with you all of us in the flyover states. One of my favorite favorite videos to watch from election night is the young turks, because it's it epitomizes the disdain that people have for people that come from states like mine. If you don't live on the coast or you're, not part of the coastal elites, they have no use for you at all. I mean I watch the news. Okay, I'll, give you a good example, something that I learned from from studying for my degree in journalism on inauguration day. They had well. First, they had the pictures of the empty, the empty spaces where they claim that nobody showed up for the inauguration, which I knew was a load of crap, because one of my local organizations said that there were people turned away at the gate because there were so many people. So I knew that was a lie immediately. But then I watched them disparage, donald for when he and melania came down in the car where they were supposed to meet with the obamas. For breakfast they criticized donald for jumping out of the car and leaving melania behind, but the video that they shot cut off at a certain point. So I did some searching, and I looked for the video that the rest of it, because I knew from the abruptness of the way they cut it off that there was something we weren't supposed to see sure enough. It's donald rushing ahead, while the driver opens the door from melania so that he can run up and open the door for the obamas in a sign of respect. They cut that part off of the video to show that he's a misogynist that leaves his wife behind he's. A racist two of his wives are immigrants. For god's sake, you know I grew up around democrats. I always thought that the republicans were the racists until I learned after doing some research that the republican party was founded to eliminate slavery. That was the purpose for the entire republican party being founded in the first place. But then I started getting arguments from people that I worked with saying yeah, but that was so long ago and I'm like well how about the voting rights act of 64.? Is that close enough for you and they were like? What do you mean? I said the democrats voted unanimously against that hillary raised barry, goldwater and margaret sanger. I can't begin to tell you how shocked I was when I found the video of her talking about eliminating the numbers in the black community, and then I started to think all the planned parenthoods in the areas where I grew up are in the poor areas. Why do we think that is? Are we trying to get rid of people that we think are a drain on society? Are you kidding me but sure I'm, the racist? Are you kidding so there's that there's the open disdain that the entire democrat establishment has held and the media, who I view, is nothing more than a than a bunch of propagandists for the democratic party. So these are just some of the many many many reasons that I chose to walk away. I went from being an absolute vehement liberal, all my life to taking that red pill in the fall of 2016 unless they fix the the links that they've fallen down. I will never vote democrat again. 2016 was the first time that I had ever voted straight party all the way down before that I was a person that would vote for the person whether they were republican or democrat. I kind of tended to think of myself as a modder kind of a moderate. I have family friends that have all turned their backs on me because they think that I am against gay people, because I voted for donald trump. I believe that every person deserves the right to be happy and the right to have their voices heard. In fact, on election night, they scheduled me to close at the store that I was working at when the return started to come in every person that I worked with at that store voted democrat. I was like maybe one of maybe three people that didn't. I sat and held their hands when they cried, because I remember standing in the legislative plaza in nashville when gore lost until two in the morning when he had his campaign manager come down to tell us to go home. You can imagine when hillary didn't address her supporters after the election. I was like well that looks familiar, stop showing disdain for the people that that give their blood, sweat and tears to you, trying to use every nasty trick that you can pull to accomplish your goals, stop clinging to power. With with all your bony fingers, you have to recognize the people that put you there in the first place, and I don't think the democratic party at this point does that I have found so much love and acceptance in this group. When I found your video brandon, it was a lifesaver. Thank you. So much hashtag walk away."

almost two decades hardcore Democrat and never had a problem disputing politics with Republicans never experienced hate or anything like that and then I voted for Obama definitely I mean who wouldn't if you're a Democrat perfect candidate and an interesting thing happened I went back to school to study a different subject outside of animal science which led me to take American history classes and a lot of constitutional study classes where you learn about the Constitution in the history of the Constitution and I started having thoughts that you know now that I'm getting a better understanding of the history and liberty and freedom and what it means that maybe I've been wrong all these years and so I kind of delve into the whole political scene and got really involved in it and then I started noticing something my Republican friends on my facebook were very thoughtful debaters never a harsh word to me ever when I supported Obama and liked what he was doing for a certain period of time but then I noticed when I started speaking out against left-leaning ideology that I kind of felt had changed since the Kennedy Democrats I noticed that my liberal friends rather than engaging and thoughtful debate or using facts started calling me names I mean I don't even know if I should say what names they're calling me but one particular comes to mind where someone who is raised in the exact circumstances is mean not that far away from me growing up called me a dick-sucker racist bigoted hillbilly and watch go suck some or caulk I mean come on I mean how misogynist is that anyways to start with but anyways one night like I said I'd for a couple years now they I have been researching politics one night at dawned on me that I am NOT a Republican I mean I am NOT a Democrat I am a Republican and I aligned with Republican ideology and I cried all night long to my husband admitting to the horrible mistake that I had meet I felt like I really betrayed my country voting Democrat for all those years and here I stand I was not a trump supporter I campaigned against him I was a Carson fan and now with Trump being president absolutely I support him want the best for our country just like I've supported every other President of the United States of America and I really want Trump to do well and I really like what he's done so far I don't particularly like his tact I think he lacks that a bit but as far as policy I like it I agree and I really hope that he wins the second term I'm in California so it's kind of normal that I was Democrat for so long but I am NOT a bot I was

85,A2LhqdIyqxM,my name is Mike I was a huge Obama supporter in 2008 along with my husband you know we were very excited when when he was elected and after about a year or two of his presidency at this point I really had nothing to do with him but I was doing a lot of research Monsanto and GMO and throughout that research I found out that Obama had appointed Michael Taylor to the FDA and that's what I would kinda consider when I swallowed the red pill I love that analogy by the way I know it's everyone's using it but I just love it so after that happened I started doing doing more research on my own and digging deeper and deeper down that rabbit hole come 2012 I had already made the decision that I wasn't gonna vote for Obama again and so I started researching other candidates and I came across Ron Paul and his message of individual freedom and liberty really resonated with me so I picked up his books and I read his books I started paying attention to what he was saying and it was kind of amazing because when I would hang out with friends or family at that point I would kind of bring Ron Paul up and not all the time but a lot of the time the first words out of their mouth were the same words were hearing now the same rather rhetoric we hear now oh that guy's a racist that guy's a homophobe that guy's a bigot and it kind of threw me back because I have been paying attention to what this guy was saying and I and and and I had read his books and I were and I thought to myself he's me he's none of those things and another big thing to me in 2012 was gay marriage and of course I looked into Ron Paul's stance on gay marriage the end his stance was that the government shouldn't even be a marriage and that that blew my mind I had never even considered thinking of it that way before and and that's that's really when you can say that that the red pill took effect and I haven't looked back so by 2016 there's not a whole lot I got to say about the last election besides I had already made the decision to walk away from from the Democratic Party you know one thing that really sticks out for me it was the Berkeley riots which you know they downplayed his protests but but we all know that they were they were riots and and the home of free speech Berkeley the home of free speech and they're they're rioting because they don't want somebody to speak that was the nail in the coffin and if there wasn't already a nail in the coffin for me and the Democratic Party of course I looked up my lowly innopolis and I started listening to what he had to say and Milo's Milo but but he definitely wasn't the monster that they portrayed him to be so what I what I what I really want to say is the beauty I'm finding in this movement is it's it's not necessarily that you have to jump on the Trump train I fully respect you if you do I love it if you do that's that's your choice my husband supported Trump but but what really what really gets to me is is I think the message is about seeing understanding and walking away from the toxicity that the Democratic Party has become you know now is the time to stand up against the mob and that that hive mentality will only last so long before it collapses and you to self -

whereas the individual will last lifetime so free yourselves my friends and thank you for listening you,"My name is Mike. I was a huge Obama supporter in 2008, along with my husband. You know we were very excited when, when he was elected and after about a year or two of his presidency at this point, I really had nothing to do with him, but I was doing a lot of research, Monsanto and GMO, and throughout that research I found out that Obama had appointed Michael Taylor to the FDA and that's what I would kinda consider when I swallowed the red pill. I love that analogy by the way. I know it's everyone's using it, but I just love it. So after that happened, I started doing doing more research on my own and digging deeper and deeper down that rabbit hole. Come 2012, I had already made the decision that I wasn't gonna vote for Obama again and so I started researching other candidates and I came across Ron Paul and his message of individual freedom and liberty really resonated with me. So I picked up his books and I read his books. I started paying attention to what he was saying, and it was kind of amazing, because when I would hang out with friends or family at that point, I would kind of bring Ron Paul up and not all the time. But a lot of the time. The first words out of their mouth were the same words were hearing now the same rather rhetoric. We hear now, oh, that guy's a racist that guy's a homophobe that guy's a bigot and it kind of threw me back because I have been paying attention to what this guy was saying and I and and and I had read his books and I were and I thought to myself. He's me he's none of those things and another big thing to me in 2012 was gay marriage and, of course, I looked into Ron Paul's stance on gay marriage. The end his stance was that the government shouldn't even be a marriage and that that blew my mind. I had never even considered thinking of it. That way before, and- and that's that's really when you can say that that the red pill took effect and I haven't looked back. So by 2016, there's not a whole lot. I got to say about the last election. Besides I had already made the decision to walk away from from the Democratic Party. You know one thing that really sticks out. For me it was the Berkeley riots which you know they downplayed his protests, but but we all know that they were. They were riots and and the home of free speech, Berkeley the home of free speech and they're they're rioting, because they don't want somebody to speak. That was the nail in the coffin and if there wasn't already a nail in the coffin for me and the Democratic Party of course, I looked up. My lowly innopolis and I started listening to what he had to say and Milo's Milo, but but he definitely wasn't the monster that they portrayed him to be so what I? What I? What I really want to say is the beauty I'm finding in this movement is it's it's not necessarily that you have to jump on the Trump train, I, fully respect you! If you do I love it. If you do that's that's your choice, my husband supported Trump, but but what really? What really gets to me is is I. Think the message is about seeing understanding and walking away from the toxicity that the Democratic Party has become. You know now is the time to stand up against the mob and that that hive mentality will only last so long before it collapses and you to self -, whereas the individual will last lifetime.

87,AdyNvvKWOTI,hi I'm Pam and this is punky pumpkin and this is my walk away Mookie and I are not really walking away from the Democratic Party as much as the Democratic Party has walked away from us I am a 58 year old proud and happy bag I was with Mary Jo woman for 13 years training for three and a half now real man so I'm telling you kind of run the gamut so I always been pretty living I didn't think I was a conservative at all until now thanks to the Democratic Party I'm conservative I have been turned away by the hate the vitriol violence the ignorance the damn witness juvenile illness I mean it just gets worse and worse it's like the mentality of the people who are believing in that baloney is just diminishing it's going down down down I didn't win it down it's just over so I'm glad that I've made that move that's it sir I just want to say I have split the Democratic Party there's a lot more than I'd like to say anything I feel like America's been subverted and of course it happened a long time ago thankfully Trump came along I was shocked I used to watch The Apprentice all the time never thought the man would be president I remember when they would make fun of it I'm some kind of cartoon back in the 80s Oh making fun of the fact that he'd be President one day is it thing you're already thinking or something but I think very impressed and surprised I remember I was a kool-aid record with Obama big-time kool-aid drinker fried when he first you know did it you know was inaugurated even though he said hail Satan I thought he was saying something else and I was clapping just like the rest of the Sheep well I learned after the first four years I was offended you know I felt kind of dude there's no stupid but I couldn't admit it to anybody because everybody was believing in this man first black guy forget that you know inside let's just look at the skin color oh okay let's just look at the skin color well no we will yes we do unfortunately that's what happened with that guy and what did he do with black community and the Latino or the agent is white rub what screwed it up big time but he was just doing what he was supposed to do did an excellent job Manchurian Candidate man was great slick slick but not like slick Willie boy Oh Hitler II took care of her man he doesn't have to worry about anything and neither does she I don't even think they have to worry about courts I think they're immune to everything I live here in Mendocino California as far as I'm concerned it's America Amerika Amerika sorry I don't wanna start shaking it stop crying I never thought I would want to sing silly something like that isn't a dope and I really didn't think much of the young men that gave their lives to make this place what it is right now I sure feel differently now coming close to leaving losing America now I have such an appreciation I'm so grateful to the Patriots it's a Trump and all the military man that stood behind him during his inauguration to let all the other guys know we got his back I didn't realize the significance of it until now that's why I'm so incredibly grateful for all of the things that I am it's uh I've been alive for 58 years I've never seen anything but lives lies back-to-back and smiles pretty quite smiles and once lies people that live in you know mansions and stuff that have nothing to do with the rest of the population yet instill they can tell a crystal population err they should live so I am what can I say happy to be here happy to be alive at this time on the planet never thought I care so much about this place if only President Bush many moons ago had told the truth instead of saying the New World Order if only he had been honest and said we want to destroy America we want to completely eradicate America I think we would have had a completely different set of experiences a lot sooner if he had been honest like that [Music] hi I'm Pam and this is punky pumpkin and this is my walk away Mookie and I are not really walking away from the Democratic Party as much as the Democratic Party has walked away from us I am a 58 year old proud and happy bag I was with Mary Jo woman

I have split the Democratic Party there's a lot more than I'd like to say anything I feel like America's been subverted and of course it happened a long time ago thankfully Trump came along I was shocked I used to watch The Apprentice all the time never thought the man would be president I remember when they would make fun of it I'm some kind of cartoon back in the 80s Oh making fun of the fact that he'd be President one day is it thing you're already thinking or something but I think very impressed and surprised I remember I was a kool-aid record with Obama big-time kool-aid drinker fried when he first you know did it you know was inaugurated even though he said hail Satan I thought he was saying something else and I was clapping just like the rest of the Sheep well I learned after the first four years I was offended you know I felt kind of dude there's no stupid but I couldn't admit it to anybody because everybody was believing in this man first black guy forget that you know inside let's just look at the skin color oh okay let's just look at the skin color well no we will yes we do unfortunately that's what happened with that guy and what did he do with black community and the Latino or the agent is white rub what screwed it up big time but he was just doing what he was supposed to do did an excellent job Manchurian Candidate man was great slick slick but

88,AE4putuUJiM,how are you doing everyone i wanted i was really thinking of making this video i just didn't want to really like i wanted to get my thoughts together and try to see if i could break this down and try to see if i could bring some sense into some people i've been uh i've been i've been living in the bronx for half of my life i was born in puerto rico and i came here uh i was raised back and forth i used to live in puerto rico come to new york i wouldn't even lived in chicago for a little bit and my deals has always been democrat they're brew and i recently started moving more to the right and for the reason is that uh i see there's a lot of uh toxic negativity going on in the democratic party and in the liberal side everything bothers them they want to abolish everything everything will everything is racist and they don't really see what it's straight they don't really think straight and why i say that is that all this thing going on right now with the police uh one of the phone police accusing every white men of being racist accusing everybody you know it's just a whole bunch of nonsense that to me really needs to be addressed and really needs to be we need to sit down and talk about this as a country because i see this country going down the hill and it's particularly the democratic party that is pushing for this and accusing trump of being the one that uh is actually destroying the country when it's actually dumb pushing to destroy this country and it's and it's crazy it's like everything they they do they actually do and everything that they actually push for and everything they always blame the other side of being the ones doing it when it's done that's doing it it's like it's crazy and for example they like to accuse trump of being a pedophile or rapist when it's the democratic party in particular this bit mostly there's mostly evidence of that and also the uh election meddling there's an election fraud they always accuse the the republicans of being the ones doing it when it's dumb there's more evidence out there that they actually are the ones that always do this frauds in elections and it's just really getting out of hand are we after me as a puerto rican i had to sit down and think about this because we are black and we are white and we are indians and we have all these combinations in our in our race that i feel that we are the only ones that can clear have a clear voice and unite the country i understand people have different um views of economic systems some people want socialism others love capitalism i used to be a socialist i used to be i used to be a fidel castro fan check about a fan i used to have i used to follow that that division i used to um participate a lot in all puerto rican nationals activities um i used to be very anti-american i used to always hate america and everything was racism the government was the most evil but it came to a point in my life that i really had to think this through is america that bad this is the greatest country in the world why i say that because we have the best freedoms we have the best constitution created by man now are we gonna sit here and blame our founding fathers for what the they did hundreds of years ago it doesn't make any sense to me it's like if i want to destroy we have a we have a monument in puerto rico it's called the castillo de motor it's a beautiful castle in old san juan and it's a very touristic place i usually every time i gotta i go to puerto rico i have to stop by and and be in that area because this just brings so much peace to me and i don't know it just i just love it and it's a beautiful um infrastructure and it i just appreciate it i appreciate the history i appreciate everything about it and i think about it should we destroy a cathedral just because slave owners created it are we really gonna go down that road are we really going to go down the road destroying old san juan the whole of san juan just because spanish slave owners created it it doesn't make any sense to me it's our history we need to love it and appreciate it regardless of what happened it's over with it doesn't exist anymore why can't we just move on as a country and just face the issues that actually exist right now we are fighting against things that doesn't even exist anymore we're not facing slavery we're not facing any oppression stop it stop crying like a baby you are stupid and you're silly you see everything i don't know what kind of what kind of i don't understand how can these people that think that you're smart they're actually some academics think this way it's just doesn't i you know i don't get it through my head how can you be so dumb and so ignorant and so missed in four are we gonna go down the road destroying this country just because we're fighting a ghost literally we're fighting ghosts this doesn't make any sense to me it's just crazy i hear my family hear my friends and hear people that i know for so long talk like this it just it's mind-blowing it's just how the hell do you even fight a ghost how you fight things that happened hundreds of years ago that doesn't affect you anyway how do you want to bring those statues it doesn't affect you at all and oh it doesn't affect you and i'm canceling shows like it doesn't make any sense to me why you canceling shows for just because you don't like it doesn't mean somebody else might not like it might like it you know it's if you don't want to wash it don't wash it it's as simple as that you don't got to go get a fit catch a fit over something that doesn't make any doesn't really affect you literally it's like so many ignorant people nowadays is crazy and that's why i had to move away from the left because the life is toxic it's poisoned to your soul it's poisoned to your brain you really people when you really need to think this through we have the greatest country we have moved past a lot of issues there's always gonna be problems in our system cops are not all racist i see listen when i used to live in the south bronx i still live in the bronx but now i live more in the north side but when i used to live in the south bronx by 138 in brook avenue there was an officer called ramirez he was a puerto rican officer he used to abuse everybody everybody used to be scared of this he used to abuse particularly the puerto ricans that's the crazy part i've seen black officers kill black people i've seen why officers kill white people i see indian officers kill people of color it doesn't matter p the problem with this country is that police got too much immunity they'll abuse their power and since they know they could get away with it most of the time they use it and abuse it that's the problem with this with the situation right here right now not that the old cops are racist not the old white people are racist we have a problem with this country that police think that they could get away with anything that's the problem and we that's what we need to address not accuse everybody not not go crazy not catch a fit not just by destroying the country we need to address the problem from its roots if we don't really face the problem of what it is we're not going to fix it we're going to continue escalating problem after problem because we're not going to the root of the issue and that's what i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to my video take care peace out,"How are you doing everyone I wanted? I was really thinking of making this video. I just didn't want to really like. I wanted to get my thoughts together and try to see if I could break this down and try to see if I could bring some sense into some people. I've been uh, I've been I've been living in the bronx for half of my life. I was born in puerto rico, and I came here uh I was raised back and forth. I used to live in puerto rico. Come to new york, I wouldn't even lived in chicago for a little bit and my deals has always been democrat. They're brew and I recently started moving more to the right and for the reason is that uh I see there's a lot of uh toxic negativity going on in the democratic party and in the liberal side everything bothers them. They want to abolish everything. Everything will everything is racist and they don't really see what it's straight. They don't really think straight and why I say that is that all this thing going on right now with the police uh one of the phone police, accusing every white men of being racist, accusing everybody- you know it's just a whole bunch of nonsense. That to me really needs to be addressed and really needs to be. We need to sit down and talk about this as a country, because I see this country going down the hill and it's particularly the democratic party that is pushing for this and accusing trump of being the one that uh is actually destroying the country when it's actually dumb pushing to destroy this country, and it's and it's crazy. It's like everything they they do. They actually do and everything that they actually push for and everything they always blame the other side of being the ones doing it. When it's done, that's doing it. It's like it's crazy and, for example, they like to accuse trump of being a pedophile or rapist when it's the democratic party in particular this bit mostly there's mostly evidence of that and also the uh election meddling. There's an election fraud. They always accuse the the republicans of being the ones doing it when it's dumb, there's more evidence out there that they actually are the ones that always do this frauds in elections, and it's just really getting out of hand. Are we after me, as a puerto rican? I had to sit down and think about this because we are black and we are white and we are indians and we have all these combinations in our in our race that I feel that we are the only ones that can clear, have a clear voice and unite the country. I understand people have different um views of economic systems. Some people want socialism, others love capitalism. I used to be a socialist I used to be I used to be a fidel castro fan check about a fan I used to have I used to follow that that division I used to um participate a lot in all puerto rican nationals activities. Um, I used to be very anti-american. I used to always hate america and everything was racism. The government was the most evil, but it came to a point in my life that I really had to think this through is america that bad this is the greatest country in the world. Why? I say that because we have the best freedoms, we have the best constitution created by man. Now are we gonna sit here and blame our founding fathers for what the they did hundreds of years ago? It doesn't make any sense to me it's like. If I want to destroy, we have a. We have a monument in puerto rico. It's called the castillo de motor, it's a beautiful castle in old san juan, and it's a very touristic place. I usually every time I gotta I go to puerto rico. I have to stop by and and be in that area, because this just brings so much peace to me, and I don't know it just I just love it and it's a beautiful um infrastructure and it I just appreciate it. I appreciate the history, I appreciate everything about it and I think about it. Should we destroy a cathedral just because slave owners created it? Are we really gonna? Go down that road? Are we really going to go down the road destroying old san, juan the whole of san juan? Just because spanish slave owners created it? It doesn't make any sense to me it's our history. We need to love it and appreciate it. Regardless of what happened it's over with it doesn't exist anymore. Why can't we just move on as a country and just face the issues that actually exist right now we are fighting against things that doesn't even exist anymore, we're not facing slavery, we're not facing any oppression. Stop it stop crying like a baby. You are stupid and you're silly. You see everything. I don't know. What kind of what kind of I don't understand? How can these people that think that you're, smart they're, actually some academics think this way? It's just doesn't I you know, I don't get it through my head: how can you be so dumb and so ignorant and so missed in four? Are we gonna go down the road destroying this country just because we're fighting a ghost literally we're fighting ghosts? This doesn't make any sense to me. It's just crazy. I hear my family hear my friends and hear people that I know for so long. Talk like this it just it's mind-blowing, it's just how the hell. Do you even fight a ghost how you fight things that happened hundreds of years ago that doesn't affect you anyway? How do you want to bring those statues? It doesn't affect you at all and oh, it doesn't affect you and I'm canceling shows like it doesn't make any sense to me why you canceling shows for just because you don't like it doesn't mean somebody else might not like it might like it. You know it's. If you don't want to wash it, don't wash it it's as simple as that you don't got to go, get a fit catch a fit over, something that doesn't make any, doesn't really affect you literally, it's like so many ignorant. People nowadays is crazy and that's why I had to move away from the left, because the life is toxic. It's poisoned to your soul, it's poisoned to your brain. You really people when you really need to think this through we have the greatest country. We have moved past a lot of issues. There's always gonna be problems in our system. Cops are not all racist. I see. Listen when I used to live in the south bronx. I still live in the bronx, but now I live more in the north side. But when I used to live in the south bronx by 138 in brook avenue, there was an officer called ramirez. He was a puerto rican officer. He used to abuse everybody. Everybody used to be scared of this. He used to abuse, particularly the puerto ricans. That's the crazy part. I've seen black officers kill black people. I've seen why officers kill white people. I see indian officers kill people of color, it doesn't matter p. The problem with this country is that police got too much immunity, they'll abuse their power, and since they know they could get away with it most of the time they use it and abuse it. That's the problem with this with the situation right here right now, not that the old cops are racist. Not the old white people are racist. We have a problem with this country that police think that they could get away with anything. That's the problem and we that's what we need to address. Not accuse everybody, not not go crazy, not catch a fit not just by destroying the country. We need to address the problem from its roots. If we don't really face the problem of what it is, we're not going to fix it, we're going to continue escalating problem after problem, because we're not going to the root of the issue and that's what I wanted to say. Thank you. So much for listening to my video take care peace out."
89,aMsHqwNME-c,how's it going everybody Zack here and I'm back with a video for you today today is actually a great day to be able to make this video because I only just discovered that this was actually a movement that I was not the only person that felt this way for such a long time as you probably have figured it out by the title of this video this is going to be my walk away story about how I was raised conservative and then I became a Democratic Party supporter and a liberal social justice warrior as its evidenced in my previous video and I want to talk a little bit of a my journey kind of just transitioning away from that and why I decided to walk away from liberalism and the Democratic Party um it's just amazing first of all to actually feel like I'm not the only one who feels this way and even though it may not be evident there's probably a lot of people who also feel this way and the fact that this is actually a thing is pretty crazy because I've been feeling this way for months you know up until maybe about eight nine or ten months ago I'd say this year in general 2018 probably the end of 2017 I had a bit of a red pill moment and I just kind of went into the details and I was I think what started it all was the Miley innopolis protests at Berkeley and that was in basically my neighborhood Berkeley just down the street it's a town that's close to Oakland and it made me investigate that a little bit and as probably a lot of other people who are embracing you know a different idea now whether it's more conservative or anything which is where I'm at now is more of a conservative standpoint it made me kind of just really really take a look as to why this guy is generating so much controversy and I really really listened to what he had to say and of course with that I discovered other people like ben shapiro and dave rubin and a lot of other folks but I didn't get there because I was just looking on the Internet over time I had felt pretty disenfranchised with the Democratic Party and that there were a lot of promises to help minority ISM to help fight racism and everything yet nothing's been done in the past few years you know I had voted for Hillary in the 2016 election and had seen and that was kind of Reich right around the end when I was a social justice warrior I have just finished college and was thinking about that but then I started to investigate it further one of the biggest defining factors was ben shapiro there was there's a video online of ben and how he talks about pro-choice i believe it's either pro-choice or abortion and I had been raised conservative and after having looked into abortion and just what it's about I realized that it's something that i morally cannot support it's just there's a part of me that after seeing how horrific it is no part of me actually agrees with that so I started investigating it further looking into really really researching what the facts were and eventually I found out that this is what the truth is okay I'm liberalism on college campuses and social justice has basically put the blame on everybody else and the thing is of course I mean that's how you would feel if you're a minority in America is you're gonna want to hear that and go yeah my struggle I am oppressed because of somebody else when in reality that's not the case in a land like America in a country like America you can make it what you want for yourself and if you're a US citizen you have the ticket to basically creating the life that you want to create and foster your own beliefs but unfortunately um it just made no sense anymore you know I started listening to arguments surrounding third wave feminism and I actually go into this in my other video about why I when I talked about social justice and that is just there's so much intolerance belligerence with people and especially in a place like the San Francisco Bay it's just that's all you hear is just people protesting about what and not really really making any chain in their own lives and I mean my thoughts are not very structured in this video but it this video that I'm making about my walk away is exactly why I'm no longer social justice warrior it's also why I decided to leave the left and I'm in pursuit of facts not feelings facts are what get things done at the end of the day and it's not about the feelings and it's also when I started to learn a little bit more about the history of the Democratic Party about how the original KKK were all Democrats or the fact that um originally the Democrats were brought into play is to keep poor people poor you know and as long as they had your vote you could keep them in office and I started investigating it further and then I just felt disenfranchised you know all of this happened at the same time as me kind of becoming red pill aware which is another thing but it was about taking the facts of the world and evaluating on what you believe is right and to be honest I made that social justice video about what I used to be one before I realized that this walkaway thing was an actual thing and this is amazing because now there's thousands of or perhaps even millions of Americans young people like myself who used to be democratic who used to believe in liberalism and no longer want to associate with that because it's nothing but a movement of hate about blaming the patriarchy for all your problems not taking responsibility for yourself that you know as long as you just listen as long if you don't agree with what I have to say and then you're automatically a racist or you're automatically a homophobe and I just want nothing to do with it anymore it's just about that's essentially it you know and it's all based in the facts the facts or what is going to affect change and create long-lasting progress in America and not feelings that's really the bottom line is it comes down to facts you govern a country based on the facts not on the biases and the prejudices of its people so that's my story that's my walkaway story I just want to kick out a quick video for you guys today let me know what you think of this video and what your

going everybody Zack here and I'm back with a video for you today. Today is actually a great day to be able to make this video, because I only just discovered that this was actually a movement. That I was not the only person that felt this way for such a long time, as you probably have figured it out by the title of this video. This is going to be my walk away story about how I was raised. Conservative and then I became a Democratic Party supporter and a liberal social justice warrior, as its evidenced in my previous video and I want to talk a little bit of a my journey kind of just transitioning away from that, and why I decided to walk away from liberalism and the Democratic Party um. It's just amazing, first of all, to actually feel like I'm, not the only one who feels this way, and even though it may not be evident, there's probably a lot of people who also feel this way, and the fact that this is actually a thing is pretty crazy, because I've been feeling this way for months. You know up until maybe about eight nine or ten months ago, I'd say this year in general, 2018, probably the end of 2017 I had a bit of a red pill moment and I. Just kind of went into the details and I was I. Think what started it all was the Miley innopolis protests at Berkeley, and that was in basically my neighborhood Berkeley just down the street. It's a town, that's close to Oakland, and it made me investigate that a little bit and as probably a lot of other people who are embracing, you know a different idea. Now, whether it's more conservative or anything which is where I'm at now is more of a conservative standpoint. It made me kind of just really really take a look as to why this guy is generating so much controversy and I really really listened to what he had to say and of course, with that I discovered other people like ben shapiro and dave rubin and a lot of other folks, but I didn't get there, because I was just looking on the Internet over time. I had felt pretty disenfranchised with the Democratic Party and that there were a lot of promises to help minority ISM to help fight racism and everything. Yet nothing's been done in the past few years. You know I had voted for Hillary in the 2016 election and had seen, and that was kind of Reich right around the end, when I was a social justice, warrior I have just finished college and was thinking about that. But then I started to investigate it. Further one of the biggest defining factors was ben shapiro. There was there's a video online of ben and how he talks about pro-choice. I believe it's either pro-choice or abortion and I had been raised. Conservative and after having looked into abortion and just what it's about I realized that it's something that I morally cannot support. It's just there's a part of me that, after seeing how horrific it is, no part of me actually agrees with that. So I started investigating it further, looking into really really researching what the facts were, and eventually I found out that this is what the truth is. Okay, I'm liberalism on college campuses and social justice has basically put the blame on everybody else, and the thing is of course I mean that's how you would feel if you're a minority in America is you're. Gonna want to hear that and go yeah. My struggle I am oppressed because of somebody else when in reality, that's not the case in a land like America in a country like America, you can make it what you want for yourself and if you're a US citizen, you have the ticket to basically creating the life that you want to create and foster your own beliefs, but unfortunately um it just made no sense anymore. You know I started listening to arguments surrounding third wave. Feminism and I actually go into this in my other video about. Why I, when I talked about social justice- and that is just there's so much intolerance, belligerence with people and especially in a place like the San Francisco Bay, it's just that's all you hear is just people protesting about what and not really really making any chain in their own lives and I mean my thoughts are not very structured in this video, but it this video that I'm making about my walk away is exactly why I'm no longer social justice warrior. It's also why I decided to leave the left and I'm in pursuit of facts, not feelings. Facts are what get things done at the end of the day and it's not about the feelings, and it's also when I started, to learn a little bit more about the history of the Democratic Party about how the original KKK were all Democrats or the fact that um originally the Democrats were brought into play, is to keep poor people poor. You know, and as long as they had your vote, you could keep them in office and I started, investigating it further and then I just felt disenfranchised.

It's just about that's essentially it. You know, and it's all based in the facts, the facts or what is going to affect change and create long-lasting progress in America and not feelings. That's really the bottom line. Is it comes down to facts. You govern a country based on the facts, not on the biases and the prejudices of its people. So that's my story. That's my walkaway story. I just want to kick out a quick video for you guys today. Let me know what you think of this video and what your story is and yeah. My name is Zack I come out with videos every day do hit that subscribe button. If you like what you see, I'll link the video to my, why I used to be a social justice warrior down below, so you can watch that as well. I, go into a little bit more details as to why thank you so much for your time and I will see you in the next video you how's it going everybody Zack here and I'm back with a video for you today. Today is actually a great day to be able to make this video, because I only just discovered that this was actually a movement. That I was not the only person that felt this way for such a long time, as you probably have figured it out by the title of this video. This is going to be my walk away story about how I was raised. Conservative and then I became a Democratic Party supporter and a liberal social justice warrior, as its evidenced in my previous video and I want to talk a little bit of a my journey kind of just transitioning away from that, and why I decided to walk away from liberalism and the Democratic Party um. It's just amazing, first of all, to actually feel like I'm, not the only one who feels this way, and even though it may not be evident, there's probably a lot of people who also feel this way, and the fact that this is actually a thing is pretty crazy, because I've been feeling this way for months. You know up until maybe about eight nine or ten months ago, I'd say this year in general. 2018, probably the end of 2017 I had a bit of a red pill moment and I. Just kind of went into the details and I was I think what started it all was the Miley innopolis protests at Berkeley, and that was in basically my neighborhood Berkeley just down the street. It's a town, that's close to Oakland, and it made me investigate that a little bit and as probably a lot of other people who are embracing, you know a different idea. Now, whether it's more conservative or anything which is where I'm at now is more of a conservative standpoint. It made me kind of just really really take a look as to why this guy is generating so much controversy and I really really listened to what he had to say and of course, with that I discovered other people like ben shapiro and dave rubin and a lot of other folks, but I didn't get there, because I was just looking on the Internet over time. I had felt pretty disenfranchised with the Democratic Party and that there were a lot of promises to help minority ISM to help fight racism and everything. Yet nothing's been done in the past few years. You know I had voted for Hillary in the 2016 election and had seen, and that was kind of Reich right around the end, when I was a social justice, warrior I have just finished college and was thinking about that. But then I started to investigate it. Further one of the biggest defining factors was ben shapiro. There was there's a video online of ben and how he talks about pro-choice. I believe it's either pro-choice or abortion and I had been raised. Conservative and after having looked into abortion and just what it's about I realized that it's something that I morally cannot support. It's just there's a part of me that, after seeing how horrific it is, no part of me actually agrees with that. So I started investigating it further, looking into really really researching what the facts were, and eventually I found out that this is what the truth is. Okay, I'm liberalism on college campuses and social justice has basically put the blame on everybody else, and the thing is of course, I mean that's how you would feel if you're a minority in America is you're. Gonna want to hear that and go yeah. My struggle I am oppressed because of somebody else when in reality, that's not the case in a land like America in a country like America, you can make it what you want for yourself and if you're a US citizen, you have the ticket to basically creating the life that you want to create and foster your own beliefs, but unfortunately um it just made no sense anymore. You know I started listening to arguments surrounding third wave. Feminism and I actually go into this in my other video about. Why I, when I talked about social justice- and that is just there's so much intolerance, belligerence with people and especially in a place like the San Francisco Bay, it's just that's all you hear is just people protesting about what and not really really making any chain in their own lives and I mean my thoughts are not very structured in this video, but it this video that I'm making about my walk away is exactly why I'm no longer social justice warrior. It's also why I decided to leave the left and I'm in pursuit of facts, not feelings. Facts are what get things done at the end of the day and it's not about the feelings, and it's also when I started, to learn a little bit more about the history of the Democratic Party about how the original KKK were all Democrats or the fact that um originally the Democrats were brought into play, is to keep poor people poor. You know, and as long as they had your vote, you could keep them in office and I started, investigating it further and then I just felt disenfranchised. You know all of this happened at the same time as me, kind of becoming red pill, aware, which is another thing, but it was about taking the facts of the world and evaluating on what you believe is right and, to be honest, I made that social justice video about what I used to be one before I, realized that this walkaway thing was an actual thing, and this is amazing, because now there's thousands of or perhaps even millions of, Americans young people like myself, who used to be democratic, who used to believe in liberalism and no longer want to associate with that, because it's nothing but a movement of hate about blaming the patriarchy for all your problems, not taking responsibility for yourself that you know as long as you just listen as long, if you don't agree with what I have to say and then you're automatically a racist or you're automatically a homophobe and I just want nothing to do with it anymore. It's just about that's essentially it. You know, and it's all based in the facts, the facts or what is going to affect change and create long-lasting progress in America and not feelings. That's really the bottom line. Is it comes down to facts. You govern a country based on the facts, not on the biases and the prejudices of its people. So that's my story. That's my walkaway story. I just want to kick out a quick video for you guys today. Let me know what you think of this video and what your story is and yeah. My name is Zack I come out with videos every day do hit that subscribe button. If you like what you see, I'll link the video to my, why I used to be a social justice warrior down below, so you can watch that as well. I, go into a little bit more details as to why thank you so much for your time and I will see you in the next video you how's it going everybody Zack here and I'm back with a video for you today. Today is actually a great day to be able to make this video, because I only just discovered that this was actually a movement. That I was not the only person that felt this way for such a long time, as you probably have figured it out by the title of this video. This is going to be my walk away story about how I was raised. Conservative and then I became a Democratic Party supporter and a liberal social justice warrior, as its evidenced in my previous video and I want to talk a little bit of a my journey kind of just transitioning away from that, and why I decided to walk away from liberalism and the Democratic Party um. It's just amazing, first of all, to actually feel like I'm, not the only one who feels this way, and even though it may not be evident, there's probably a lot of people who also feel this way, and the fact that this is actually a thing is pretty crazy, because I've been feeling this way for months. You know up until maybe about eight nine or ten months ago, I'd say this year in general. 2018, probably the end of 2017 I had a bit of a red pill moment and I. Just kind of went into the details and I was I think what started it all was the Miley innopolis protests at Berkeley, and that was in basically my neighborhood Berkeley just down the street. It's a town, that's close to Oakland, and it made me investigate that a little bit and as probably a lot of other people who are embracing, you know a different idea. Now, whether it's more conservative or anything which is where I'm at now is more of a conservative standpoint. It made me kind of just really really take a look as to why this guy is generating so much controversy and I really really listened to what he had to say and of course, with that I discovered other people like ben shapiro and dave rubin and a lot of other folks, but I didn't get there, because I was just looking on the Internet over time. I had felt pretty disenfranchised with the Democratic Party and that there were a lot of promises to help minority ISM to help fight racism and everything. Yet nothing's been done in the past few years. You know I had voted for Hillary in the 2016 election and had seen, and that was kind of Reich right around the end, when I was a social justice, warrior I have just finished college and was thinking about that. But then I started to investigate it. Further one of the biggest defining factors was ben shapiro. There was there's a video online of ben and how he talks about pro-choice. I believe it's either pro-choice or abortion and I had been raised. Conservative and after having looked into abortion and just what it's about I realized that it's something that I morally cannot support. It's just there's a part of me that, after seeing how horrific it is, no part of me actually agrees with that. So I started investigating it further, looking into really really researching what the facts were, and eventually I found out that this is what the truth is. Okay, I'm liberalism on college campuses and social justice has basically put the blame on everybody else, and the thing is of course, I mean that's how you would feel if you're a minority in America is you're. Gonna want to hear that and go yeah. My struggle I am oppressed because of somebody else when in reality, that's not the case in a land like America in a country like America, you can make it what you want for yourself and if you're a US citizen, you have the ticket to basically creating the life that you want to create and foster your own beliefs, but unfortunately um it just made no sense anymore. You know I started listening to arguments surrounding third wave. Feminism and I actually go into this in my other video about. Why I, when I talked about social justice- and that is just there's so much intolerance, belligerence with people and especially in a place like the San Francisco Bay, it's just that's all you hear is just people protesting about what and not really really making any chain in their own lives and I mean my thoughts are not very structured in this video, but it this video that I'm making about my walk away is exactly why I'm no longer social justice warrior. It's also why I decided to leave the left and I'm in pursuit of facts, not feelings. Facts are what get things done at the end of the day and it's not about the feelings, and it's also when I started, to learn a little bit more about the history of the Democratic Party about how the original KKK were all Democrats or the fact that um originally the Democrats were brought into play, is to keep poor people poor. You know, and as long as they had your vote, you could keep them in office and I started, investigating it further and then I just felt disenfranchised. You know all of this happened at the same time as me, kind of becoming red pill, aware, which is another thing, but it was about taking the facts of the world and evaluating on what you believe is right and, to be honest, I made that social justice video about what I used to be one before I, realized that this walkaway thing was an actual thing, and this is amazing, because now there's thousands of or perhaps even millions of, Americans young people like myself, who used to be democratic, who used to believe in liberalism and no longer want to associate with that, because it's nothing but a movement of hate about blaming the patriarchy for all your problems, not taking responsibility for yourself that you know as long as you just listen as long, if you don't agree with what I have to say and then you're automatically a racist or you're automatically a homophobe and I just want nothing to do with it anymore. It's just about that's essentially it. You know, and it's all based in the facts, the facts or what is going to affect change and create long-lasting progress in America and not feelings. That's really the bottom line. Is it comes down to facts. You govern a country based on the facts, not on the biases and the prejudices of its people. So that's my story. That's my walkaway story. I just want to kick out a quick video for you guys today. Let me know what you think of this video and what your story is and yeah. My name is Zack I come out with videos every day do hit that subscribe button. If you like what you see, I'll link the video to my, why I used to be a social justice warrior down below, so you can watch that as well. I, go into a little bit more details as to why thank you so much for your time and I will see you in the next video you."
90,aqGANUGUD3k,so today i was told that i need to go myself because of who i support i've been a democrat at hearts way i was raised they were for equality gay rights black rights doesn't matter who you are they're for equality it's the way i was raised i've been against president trump since he was elected up until this year i finally stopped and did research of my own found out everything that i was told that he's a racist a liar everything else was just to make me hate him i haven't seen any evidence of it never have and never will but today when my so-called party that i'm part of says that peaceful protesting involves burning down buildings looting stores ruining other people's lives that to me is not peaceful protesting and that's what made me walk away from the democratic party tonight i was told by one of my liberal friends to go myself because i support trump for 2020. it's funny though growing up democrat you're taught love everybody respect everybody everybody has their right to do what they wish but when it comes down to it you start viewing things differently than they do all of a sudden that policy goes right out the window do i support trump for 2020 yes i do do i support the democratic party in the future most likely not this year i have walked away i have lost a lot of friends actually over the last couple weeks especially all because of who i support myself i am a gay man and i've been called a right-winged traitor because i support trump and became a republican this year i just don't get how people who preach nothing but peace and kindness and love for everybody can be so hateful but in turn call us hateful because of our support for trump who's supposed to be this big racist sexist bigot and you know what i believed everything the media said about that up until this year when i finally started realizing stuff hey was it from trump's side of the racist sexist bigotry it was the democratic side that i've seen to it and i've lost a lot of friends this year because of my support for trump and walking away from the democratic party just hope in the future i can make some new ones that actually either support the same views i have or doesn't matter to them what views i have hashtag walk away 20 20. have a good day,"So today I was told that I need to go myself because of who I support. I've been a democrat at hearts way I was raised. They were for equality, gay rights, black rights doesn't matter who you are they're for equality. It's the way I was raised. I've been against president trump since he was elected up until this year. I finally stopped and did research of my own found out everything that I was told that he's a racist, a liar. Everything else was just to make me hate him. I haven't seen any evidence of it, never have and never will, but today, when my so-called party, that I'm part of says that peaceful protesting involves burning down buildings, looting stores, ruining other people's lives. That to me, is not peaceful protesting and that's what made me walk away from the democratic party tonight. I was told by one of my liberal friends to go myself because I support trump for 2020.. It's funny, though growing up democrat you're taught love everybody respect everybody. Everybody has their right to do what they wish, but when it comes down to it, you start viewing things differently than they do all of a sudden. That policy goes right out the window. Do I support trump for 2020? Yes, I do do I support the democratic party in the future, most likely not this year, I have walked away. I have lost a lot of friends actually over the last couple weeks, especially all because of who I support myself. I am a gay man and I've been called a right-winged traitor, because I support trump and became a republican this year. I just don't get how people who preach nothing, but peace and kindness and love for everybody can be so hateful, but in turn call us hateful because of our support for trump who's supposed to be this big racist, sexist bigot- and you know what I believed everything the media said about that up until this year, when I finally started realizing stuff, hey was it from trump's side of the racist, sexist bigotry? It was the democratic side that I've seen to it, and I've lost a lot of friends this year because of my support for trump and walking away from the democratic party just hope in the future. I can make some new ones that actually either support the same views. I have or doesn't matter to them. What views I have hashtag walk away. 20 20. have a good day."
91,aRoj_2fY7sc,so I I had not been paying much attention to the quote walkaway movement you're all familiar with hashtag walkaway so I read a little bit about the thinking behind it and I was wondering what policy is it in particular is is it because you know my assumption which was incorrect my assumption was that maybe it's policy related or maybe it's you know they just prefer the Republican policies after all or maybe it's they're just saying that the president is being effective in a general way that's what I thought before I read the details oh oh my viewers this is way more interesting on that I don't know if you quite caught it but let me put it in context I like to talk about the most you know how I talk about the persuasion filter it's a way of looking at the world as if everything is persuasion and the facts and reason are things we pretend we care about but sort of don't and I've also said that President Trump and I said this I know two years ago would quote punch a hole in the universe or or put a tear in the universe so that you could look through the hole and see reality for the first time because we all walk around in this little little bubble movie of our own making and I said that he's gonna let you see reality at least a little bit of it not all of it cuz we're not we're not able but he would put a hole in your current bubble so you could just peek out and see what's on the other side and you'd say holy cap I'm in a bubble so really the most you're gonna get out of this is the knowledge certain that you've been living in a bubble of truth that you created in your own head as opposed to truth that exists at the universe and apparently that's what happened to Brendon Straka because here's how he describes his thinking behind the walk away was it about policy here's what it was about he realized that the Democrats were using fear to manipulate people that's a big deal that's a big deal that's peeking through the hole in the universe it wasn't about policies wasn't about out you know which leaders a little more effective was it about who cares about you wasn't about who's got the best plans for the future he realized that one side was manipulating them with fear and that that's all that was going on well that's not all this going on but that was the big picture the big picture was persuasion that was fear-based and the fear wasn't real now you're saying to yourself Trump uses fear to manipulate you to here's the difference the fear that Trump uses and and he does use the fear to manipulate he's talking about fear of people outside the country in many cases who have actually killed lots of people like Isis and terrorists so when he's tough on the border he's pointing to ms-13 who are real people ms-13 actually kills people and apparently we're only just learning that the although immigrants as a group have an unusually low crime rate yeah immigrants a very Pro immigrant low crime rate great addition to the country but among the class of illegal ones were breaking the law to get in it turns out that the rate of murder and violent crime and stuff is is far higher than their percentage in the population so they are literally a high crime group just the illegal immigrants in general awesome people contributing to the country lower cried in the normal lower crime than average so Trump's fear is based on people who really exist and really are hurting people those are things you actually should be worried about Trump's fear would be you know you could argue that he's scared everybody with North Korea but that's a real fear and he got a pretty good result there or at least it seems to add in the right direction so but if you look at now look at the Democrats version of fear their fear is of your fellow citizen is that a sexist term can you say that anymore can you say your fellow citizen is that sexist what's what's the generic ways that your other citizens your teammates your your country people comrade citizen somebody says so notice the huge difference there so Brendon Straka has realized that the Democrats are creating fear of each other Trump is creating fear almost entirely I can't think of an example of people who are outside our borders who are literally armed and dangerous people with actual guns and weapons who are actually using them it's a little bit different right there's one thing you should be afraid of and there's one thing that's largely invented and enough time has now passed so that any reasonable citizen can see that the things that people said about Trump were clearly untrue that there was a fear that he would tank the economy not true there was a fear that you would blow up the world with nuclear weapons and never get anywhere with North Korea cuz he's a he was a crazy man he's crazier than kim jungeun and not true and you know what it wasn't even true that kim jungeun is crazy and anyway that matters for negotiating negotiated what else is oh there was a fear that you would he would round up gay people and you know put them in camps obviously not true there was a fear that you know he would do this or that anyway so it's becoming more and more clear to the people on the left that they've been taken by their own side that they're their own side is using fear of their of their own country people I don't want to say countrymen you know you realize how sexist all of our old terms are but that is a powerful it's a very powerful thought and if this walk away thing had been you know based on oh I think I've changed my mind and I like the Republican policies better I'd say to myself yeah that's not much you know a few people will change change parties because the policy is no big deal but when people are talking about changing parties because they realized that they're being taken that they're just being taken manipulated by fear and that they're let me let me put this in perspective I imagine if you will that all of the coverage of this President had been just straight objective coverage that then nobody ever gave an opinion of what they thought he would do or what they thought he was thinking what if the only coverage you'd seen had been coverage of Trump as a person who does stuff and you just observe what he does you know compared to maybe what he promised and say yeah yeah he's he's doing the things that we got elected for etc here's what people think of it here's what they don't you know the but but if the news had not become let's say participants in the political process had they moved had they not moved from an observer watchdog role to actual participants they're trying to to you know move the needle would the left be afraid of this president a little maybe just because you know it's a big country and a lot of different opinions a lot of different individuals but probably nothing like we're seeing I would argue that close to a hundred percent of the fear that people have about this president is based on you know non objective coverage would you say that's true would you agree with me that almost a hundred percent of the fear the the I'm talking about the irrational fear the the thing that makes people vomit and and shake because that's what people are experiencing right you know joke all you will about you know the the left you know howling at the moon and stuff like that but this is a real medical problem they're they've lived for 18 months in in total fear where is that fear coming from well they've been manipulated into believing it's coming from the president that it's because of the things he's doing the things he's thinking which is crazy because they don't know what he thinks and the things that in their imagination he might do those things all come from the press you know in the the opinion part of the press mostly that's not coming from the president what has the president said recently that would scare a citizen of the United States now I do think there's a role of the press and that the public opinion and everything has changed this president's policy preferences so for example when he was campaigning he was talking about deporting 14 million people who are here undocumented but otherwise good citizens and of course he's not doing that it doesn't look like there's anything any real chance of that happening so there are some big things that we see the public pretty much immediately causes president to change opinions take the children in cages for example you know the public had its say and it looked like a public had his say and he changed now somebody saying what about the repeal of Roe versus Wade we'll talk about that in a minute anyway so my point is that this Brandon Straka what he's doing is far more important than I imagined when I was just reading the headline about it and I didn't read the detail once you see his reason that he realized that Democrats are manipulating people into this permanent unhealthy unhealthy unhealthy very very physically and mentally unhealthy have I mentioned unhealthy state so the Democrats for their their political for their political benefit have caused the entire left to be in physical and mental distress for two years policies mala see does policy matter to you if you realize that your own team has made you deeply unhealthy for two years intentionally for their own game let me ask you this if you want to get mad you know you probably won't get as mad the people who are watching this periscope but if you are on the Left let me ask you this do you believe that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are as afraid for the future as they have made you feel let that just hang there for a minute if you're a Democrat do you think that Schumer and Pelosi are as afraid about what might happen with this president with the country as they have made you the voter feel not a chance not even a slight chance and you know what you could tell you could tell just by looking at them have you ever seen an actual anti-trump are like a citizen you know like a just a regular citizen who has fear of the future for the country because of the president have you watched them this is no joke their fear is physical they are physically shaking they are you can see it in their eyes there is a deep real fear who put that there their own people their own leaders do those leaders share that feel not that fear not a chance so I I had not been paying much attention to the quote walkaway movement you're all familiar with hashtag walkaway so I read a little bit about the thinking behind it and I was wondering what policy is it in particular is is it because you know my assumption which was incorrect my assumption was that maybe it's policy related or maybe it's you know they

hashtag walkaway, so I read a little bit about the thinking behind it and I was wondering what policy is it in particular is? Is it because you know my assumption, which was incorrect? My assumption was that maybe it's policy related or maybe it's you know they just prefer the Republican policies. After all, or maybe it's they're, just saying that the president is being effective in a general way. That's what I thought before I read the details. Oh oh, my viewers. This is way more interesting on that I. Don't know if you quite caught it, but let me put it in context. I like to talk about the most. You know how I talk about the persuasion filter it's a way of looking at the world as if everything is persuasion and the facts and reason are things we pretend we care about, but sort of don't and I've also said that President, Trump and I said this. I know two years ago would quote punch a hole in the universe or or put a tear in the universe, so that you could look through the hole and see reality for the first time, because we all walk around in this little little bubble, movie of our own making and I said that he's gonna, let you see reality at least a little bit of it, not all of it. Cuz we're not we're not able, but he would put a hole in your current bubble, so you could just peek out and see what's on the other side and you'd say holy cap I'm in a bubble, so really the most you're gonna get out of this is the knowledge certain that you've been living in a bubble of truth that you created in your own head as opposed to truth that exists at the universe and apparently that's what happened to Brendon Straka, because here's how he describes his thinking behind the walk away. Was it about policy? Here's what it was about. He realized that the Democrats were using fear to manipulate people. That's a big deal! That's a big deal! That's peeking! Through the hole in the universe, it wasn't about policies wasn't about out. You know which leaders a little more effective was it about. Who cares about you wasn't about who's, got the best plans for the future. He realized that one side was manipulating them with fear and that that's all that was going on. Well, that's not all this going on, but that was the big picture. The big picture was persuasion that was fear-based and the fear wasn't real. Now, you're saying to yourself, Trump uses fear to manipulate you to here's the difference, the fear that Trump uses and- and he does use the fear to manipulate he's talking about fear of people outside the country in many cases who have actually killed lots of people like Isis and terrorists. So when he's tough on the border he's pointing to ms-13 who are real, people, ms-13 actually kills people and apparently we're only just learning that the although immigrants as a group have an unusually low crime rate, yeah immigrants, a very Pro immigrant, low crime rate, great addition to the country, but among the class of illegal ones, were breaking the law to get in. It turns out that the rate of murder and violent crime and stuff is is far higher than their percentage in the population, so they are literally a high crime group. Just the illegal immigrants in general, awesome people contributing to the country lower cried in the normal, lower crime than average, so Trump's fear is based on people who really exist and really are hurting people. Those are things you actually should be worried about. Trump's fear would be you know, you could argue that he's scared everybody with North Korea, but that's a real fear and he got a pretty good result there, or at least it seems to add in the right direction. So, but if you look at now, look at the Democrats version of fear, their fear is of your fellow citizen. Is that a sexist term? Can you say that anymore? Can you say your fellow citizen? Is that sexist? What's what's the generic ways that your other citizens, your teammates, your your country, people, comrade citizen somebody says so notice, the huge difference there so Brendon Straka has realized that the Democrats are creating fear of each other. Trump is creating fear almost entirely I, can't think of an example of people who are outside our borders, who are literally armed and dangerous people with actual guns and weapons who are actually using them. It's a little bit different right. There's one thing you should be afraid of and there's one thing, that's largely invented and enough time has now passed so that any reasonable citizen can see that the things that people said about Trump were clearly untrue, that there was a fear that he would tank the economy not true. There was a fear that you would blow up the world with nuclear weapons and never get anywhere with North Korea cuz he's a. He was a crazy man, he's crazier than kim jungeun and not true, and you know what it wasn't even true that kim jungeun is crazy and anyway that matters for negotiating negotiated. What else is? Oh, there was a fear that you would. He would round up gay people and you know, put them in camps, obviously not true. There was a fear that you know he would do this or that anyway, so it's becoming more and more clear to the people on the left that they've been taken by their own side that they're their own side is using fear of their of their own country. People I, don't want to say, countrymen. You know you realize how sexist all of our old terms are, but that is a powerful. It's a very powerful thought, and if this walk away thing had been, you know, based on oh I, think I've changed my mind and I like the Republican policies, better I'd say to myself: yeah, that's not much. You know a few people will change change parties, because the policy is no big deal, but when people are talking about changing parties because they realized that they're being taken that they're just being taken manipulated by fear and that they're, let me let me put this in perspective I. Imagine if you will that all of the coverage of this President had been just straight objective coverage that then nobody ever gave an opinion of what they thought he would do or what they thought. He was thinking. What, if the only coverage you'd seen had been coverage of Trump as a person who does stuff- and you just observe what he does you know compared to maybe what he promised and say, yeah yeah he's he's doing the things that we got elected for, etc. Here's what people think of it, here's what they don't. You know the, but, but if the news had not become, let's say participants in the political process had they moved had they not moved from an observer watchdog, role to actual participants. They're trying to to you know, move the needle. Would the left be afraid of this president? A little, maybe just because you know it's a big country and a lot of different opinions, a lot of different individuals, but probably nothing like we're seeing I- would argue that close to a hundred percent of the fear that people have about this, president is based on. You know non objective coverage. Would you say that's true? Would you agree with me that almost a hundred percent of the fear, the the I'm talking about the irrational fear, the the thing that makes people vomit and and shake because that's what people are experiencing right? You know joke all you will about. You know the the left. You know howling at the moon and stuff like that, but this is a real medical problem. They're they've lived for 18 months in in total fear. Where is that fear coming from well they've, been manipulated into believing it's coming from the president that it's because of the things he's doing the things he's thinking which is crazy because they don't know what he thinks and the things that in their imagination he might do those things all come from the press. You know in the the opinion part of the press, mostly that's not coming from the president. What has the president said recently that would scare a citizen of the United States now I do think, there's a role of the press and that the public opinion and everything has changed this president's policy preferences. So, for example, when he was campaigning, he was talking about deporting 14 million people who are here undocumented, but otherwise good citizens and, of course, he's not doing that it doesn't look like there's anything any real chance of that happening. So there are some big things that we see the public. Pretty much immediately causes president to change opinions take the children in cages. For example, you know the public had its say and it looked like a public had his say and he changed now. Somebody saying what about the repeal of Roe versus Wade we'll talk about that in a minute anyway. So my point is that this Brandon Straka, what he's doing is far more important than I imagined when I was just reading the headline about it and I didn't read the detail once you see his reason that he realized that Democrats are manipulating people into this permanent unhealthy, unhealthy, unhealthy, very, very physically and mentally unhealthy have I mentioned unhealthy state, so the Democrats for their their political for their political benefit have caused the entire left to be in physical and mental distress for two years policies mala see does policy matter to you. If you realize that your own team has made you deeply unhealthy for two years intentionally for their own game. Let me ask you this: if you want to get mad, you know you probably won't get as mad the people who are watching this periscope. But if you are on the Left, let me ask you this: do you believe that Chuck, Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are as afraid for the future as they have made? You feel let that just hang there for a minute, if you're a Democrat, do you think that Schumer and Pelosi are as afraid about what might happen with this president with the country as they have made you, the voter, feel not a chance, not even a slight chance, and you know what you could tell you could tell just by looking at them. Have you ever seen an actual anti-trump are like a citizen. You know like a just a regular citizen who has fear of the future for the country because of the president. Have you watched them? This is no joke. Their fear is physical. They are physically shaking they are. You can see it in their eyes. There is a deep, real fear who put that there, their own people, their own leaders. Do those leaders share that feel? Not that fear not a chance. So I I had not been paying much attention to the quote: walkaway movement you're all familiar with hashtag walkaway, so I read a little bit about the thinking behind it, and I was wondering what policy is it in particular is? Is it because you know my assumption, which was incorrect? My assumption was that maybe it's policy related or maybe it's you know they just prefer the Republican policies after all, or maybe it's they're, just saying that the president is being effective in a general way. That's what I thought before I read the details. Oh oh, my viewers. This is way more interesting on that I. Don't know if you quite caught it, but let me put it in context. I like to talk about the most. You know how I talk about the persuasion filter it's a way of looking at the world as if everything is persuasion and the facts and reason are things we pretend we care about, but sort of don't and I've also said that President, Trump and I said this. I know two years ago would quote punch a hole in the universe or or put a tear in the universe, so that you could look through the hole and see reality for the first time, because we all walk around in this little little bubble, movie of our own making and I said that he's gonna. Let you see reality at least a little bit of it, not all of it. Cuz we're not we're not able, but he would put a hole in your current bubble, so you could just peek out and see what's on the other side and you'd say holy cap I'm in a bubble, so really the most you're gonna get out of this is the knowledge certain that you've been living in a bubble of truth that you created in your own head as opposed to truth that exists at the universe and apparently that's what happened to Brendon Straka, because here's how he describes his thinking behind the walk away. Was it about policy? Here's what it was about. He realized that the Democrats were using fear to manipulate people. That's a big deal. That's a big deal, that's peeking through the hole in the universe. It wasn't about policies wasn't about out. You know which leaders a little more effective was it about. Who cares about you wasn't about who's, got the best plans for the future. He realized that one side was manipulating them with fear and that that's all that was going on. Well, that's not all this going on, but that was the big picture. The big picture was persuasion that was fear-based and the fear wasn't real. Now, you're saying to yourself, Trump uses fear to manipulate you to here's the difference, the fear that Trump uses and- and he does use the fear to manipulate he's talking about fear of people outside the country in many cases who have actually killed lots of people like Isis and terrorists. So when he's tough on the border, he's pointing to ms-13 who are real, people, ms-13 actually kills people and apparently we're only just learning that the although immigrants as a group have an unusually low crime rate, yeah immigrants, a very Pro immigrant, low crime rate, great addition to the country, but among the class of illegal ones, were breaking the law to get in. It turns out that the rate of murder and violent crime and stuff is is far higher than their percentage in the population, so they are literally a high crime group. Just the illegal immigrants in general, awesome people contributing to the country lower cried in the normal lower crime than average. So Trump's fear is based on people who really exist and really are hurting people. Those are things you actually should be worried about. Trump's fear would be. You know, you could argue that he's scared, everybody with North Korea, but that's a real fear and he got a pretty good result there, or at least it seems to add in the right direction. So, but if you look at now, look at the Democrats version of fear, their fear is of your fellow citizen. Is that a sexist term? Can you say that anymore? Can you say your fellow citizen? Is that sexist? What's what's the generic ways that your other citizens, your teammates, your your country, people, comrade citizen somebody says so notice, the huge difference there so Brendon Straka has realized that the Democrats are creating fear of each other. Trump is creating fear almost entirely I, can't think of an example of people who are outside our borders, who are literally armed and dangerous people with actual guns and weapons who are actually using them. It's a little bit different right. There's one thing you should be afraid of and there's one thing, that's largely invented and enough time has now passed so that any reasonable citizen can see that the things that people said about Trump were clearly untrue, that there was a fear that he would tank the economy not true. There was a fear that you would blow up the world with nuclear weapons and never get anywhere with North Korea cuz he's a. He was a crazy man, he's crazier than kim jungeun and not true, and you know what it wasn't even true that kim jungeun is crazy and anyway that matters for negotiating negotiated. What else is? Oh, there was a fear that you would he would round up gay people and you know, put them in camps, obviously not true. There was a fear that you know he would do this or that anyway, so it's becoming more and more clear to the people on the left that they've been taken by their own side that they're their own side is using fear of their of their own country. People I, don't want to say, countrymen. You know you realize how sexist all of our old terms are, but that is a powerful. It's a very powerful thought, and if this walk away thing had been, you know, based on oh I, think I've changed my mind and I like the Republican policies, better I'd say to myself: yeah, that's not much. You know a few people will change change parties because the policy is no big deal, but when people are talking about changing parties because they realized that they're being taken that they're just being taken, manipulated by fear and that they're, let me let me put this in perspective I. Imagine if you will that all of the coverage of this President had been just straight objective coverage that then nobody ever gave an opinion of what they thought he would do or what they thought. He was thinking. What, if the only coverage you'd seen had been coverage of Trump as a person who does stuff- and you just observe what he does you know compared to maybe what he promised and say: yeah yeah he's he's doing the things that we got elected for, etc. Here's what people think of it, here's what they don't. You know the, but, but if the news had not become let's say participants in the political process had they moved had they not moved from an observer watchdog role to actual participants. They're trying to to you know, move the needle. Would the left be afraid of this president? A little? Maybe just because you know it's a big country and a lot of different opinions, a lot of different individuals, but probably nothing like we're seeing I would argue that close to a hundred percent of the fear that people have about this, president is based on.

I never even watched his show, but when he came down that escalator I said you know, we really do need a change, not the hope and change. Obama promised us, though I did vote for him the first time, but change shake up the White House shake up other countries who have been taking advantage of us who have been treating us like second-class citizens. We need to shake up the world. Do I, agree with Trump 100% of the time. No, but do I know where he's coming from absolutely Obama promised us the world and gave us nothing he promised for that wonderful change. Well, the change was what people out of work race, fights like I, have I I, can't even remember them being this bad in the 70s we were getting along with our brother and sister. The color of us concern Oh longer a thing: were they bad whites? Yes, still are. Were there bad blacks? Yes still are, but we were walk working towards a common goal. The jobless rate was unbelievable. It took such a hit and Obama said all those jobs, they're not gonna, come back. They are coming back. Do people hate that Trump doesn't only not walk softly, he worked walk side and he does carry a big stick, but isn't it better than a little pen that does nothing and says nothing or a red line in the sand that gets washed away on the next high tide. I love our president, I stand by him. I will vote Republican, not because they're the best of the bunch, but because I gave the Democrats 40 years of my life and I have nothing to show for it, but a double-wide.

94,AWhvwegeoOE,my name is ellen yaskowitz and i'm a walk with but this is my walk away video nonetheless politically i am conservative and i have been for a long time but i haven't been confident enough of myself to stand for what i am that has changed i have walked away from my fear of the social stigma the left tries to place on the right and 40-somethings and younger and i realize it is more important that i have faith in my beliefs and the courage to stand up for them than to maintain friendships with people who refuse to respect me for who i am and what i believe the science fiction writer and the martial arts instructor 30 years of taekwondo and i can tell you that the second is the one place in my life i have never really run into politics but back to why i'm here this is about a problem i've had for many years with how the entertainment industry is run in general written television movies and otherwise and how they look to conservatism like it's something unacceptable it's not a nice way to get looked at brandon made his points well and he's inspired i can't imagine how many people to stand up and make their beliefs known to help them not be afraid to do it if you ask me there are a whole lot more people out here who agree with you folks and share the same kind of nervousness i do but now they understand that if the people in question people like when i'm like who i'm thinking about are really your friends really my friends then they'll respect my views and the right to have them god bless you all and keep walking strong,"My name is ellen yaskowitz and I'm a walk with, but this is my walk away, video nonetheless politically, I am conservative and I have been for a long time, but I haven't been confident enough of myself to stand for what I am that has changed. I have walked away from my fear of the social stigma the left tries to place on the right and 40-somethings and younger, and I realize it is more important that I have faith in my beliefs and the courage to stand up for them than to maintain friendships with people who refuse to respect me for who I am and what I believe, the science fiction writer and the martial arts instructor 30 years of taekwondo, and I can tell you that the second is the one place in my life. I have never really run into politics, but back to why I'm here. This is about a problem. I've had for many years with how the entertainment industry is run in general, written television movies and otherwise, and how they look to conservatism like it's something, unacceptable. It's not a nice way to get looked at brandon made his points. Well and he's inspired, I can't imagine how many people to stand up and make their beliefs known to help them not be afraid to do it. If you ask me, there are a whole lot more people out here who agree with you folks and share the same kind of nervousness. I do, but now they understand that if the people in question people like when I'm like, who I'm thinking about, are really your friends really my friends, then they'll respect my views and the right to have them. God bless you all and keep walking strong."
95,B-iuczcExCg,hey everybody this is writer and citizen journalist Leslie Sol here so some interesting things have happened in California I used to work for the agricultural Labor Relations Board of course their corrupt little agency created by Jerry Brown they just reconfirmed my old boss Catherine Rivera Hernandez for another term no matter what she's done because the Democrats in this state seemed to support each other no matter what so no matter what corrupt evil things they do no matter how badly they act so I think that's part of the reason that that there is this mass exodus out of California right now I'm considering becoming part of that Exodus myself because things have gotten so out of hand here so bureaucratic that nothing nothing can be done no progress can be made I can't even clear my state file after two years of having quit the agency so and with no answer no lawyers are coming to help me no one's coming to my aid on this no matter how much effort I've put in trying to get this taken care of and resolved somehow so that I can just continue on with my life they are bound and determined to to just try and destroy me as best they can so and I think this is a reason why we see things like the walk away hashtag on Twitter becoming such a popular thing it's people are sharing their stories like mine about the Democrat Party about how evil vicious they're and stating that you should just walk away I'm saying you should run the hell away don't walk away so at any rate you know what I don't know what to do at this point I might just leave the state I'm

96,b6VaQnyRetY,well as a friend of mine once said once upon a time I was a liberal I'm not quite as good at the smoldery blue-steel sort of stares Brandon is but I'll do my best we are raised to be leftist we are raised to be loyal soldiers to the Democratic Party even when I was in high school but in public school the history teacher took the class on an illegal trip to Cuba to teach about the joys of socialism and when they asked him why he was like oh well I'm a communist you know of course um you know this school they had no debate Club no civics club but there was communism club so you know it is just impounded in our heads at an early age I had always been a liberal but I never really bought into this whole collective [ __ ] I was always a rebel I was always different even in terms of being gay I never felt accepted by the gay community I never felt like I was part of them I always felt judged and they're mainly all about groupthink and conformity and looking speaking acting thinking exactly as they do and that was just never what I was about so I guess my red pill story is a little bit darker than some people's so I guess I'll just say that in summer of 2012 I had a home invasion sort of thing and I was raped sorry there's weird to talk about so openly you know without going into all the details I guess I was living in an apartment in Brooklyn with like five roommates and you know they were all leftist activists and all into drugs and one guy who was my roommate at the time was very closeted and so you know they moved out and I guess he kept his keys you know I was there alone five in the morning you know but anyway the point is at the time all of my friends were radical leftists you know male feminist social justice warriors rape activists the works those are favorite words all they ever talked about rape rape culture I hate the term by the way so I really thought that going to these people like wow they're experts in rape they you know it's all they talk about that I really thought they would support me and have my back and help me seek justice and all that that wasn't quite the reception I I learned very quickly that when this happens to a guy nobody wants to hear about it nobody will let you talk about it nobody cares I would try and talk about I needed to talk about it you know with my friends and nobody cared they would smile nod and immediately change the subject yet then every moment of every day I would be told by them well imagine how women feel and women have it worse and you know these women they can't walk down the street without being raped and you know oh these women they get raped and it ruins their lives and women women when you know it's as if they were telling me to just shut up because women have it worse I just couldn't believe the hypocrisy of these people at this time - it was all in the news about comedians and rape jokes and wanting to ban that so these same people then everyday we're just talking about how you know they're protesting some comedian and rape jokes and rape is never funny rape is never funny and I just thought to myself in that moment I was like you know I don't know how I don't know when but someday I'm gonna find a way to laugh about what happened to me just to spite them so it is this time to that I noticed how politically correct everyone was becoming that you could not say a word without being called some sort of name this one time I had gone on a really awkward date with this guy where he asked if he could kiss me um so when I like told friends about this I wrote a post that you know it's very unattractive when someone asks to kiss you these same people then jump down my throat you're a sexist and you need affirmative consent and you're advocating rape you're a rape apologist you know knowing what I had just gone through so this is how they treat people that they claim to champion you know but anyway there were a couple of instances that led to my red pill hang so if that was the first one the second was this now after this happened obviously I had to get out of that apartment I couldn't be there but it was the middle of the month I know where to go I had no money I couldn't find an apartment so I ended up calling some room rental service where you can just move in that day so they said they had a place super cheap Lower East Side in Manhattan great neighborhood I was like perfect I'll take it so I show up there with my things it's in the projects I lived in the projects for about a month and a half now let me tell you something you cannot live in the projects for any amount of time and come out of there illiberal it's not possible I think I was very ignorant as to just how dangerous it was you know in retrospect I really don't know how I survived especially looking like an emaciated albino alien vampire like I do but I think people don't realize just how bad the situation is in places like that it's bad the people there are so dangerous you know assaulting people mugging people there's piss and [ __ ] everywhere and you know needles hanging out of their arms and those are the good ones you know so anyway the woman who I was renting the room in her apartment she was 26 years old for kids from four different fathers most of them incarcerated and you know when I asked her what do you do she said I'm in the system as her parents were as her kids will be you know that's the situation when you are put on welfare you are meant to stay there so you know and she would tell me about how like the buzzwords she would use to get more money and if you have more kids you get more money and you know meanwhile every day she would come home with shopping bags of like X boxes and iPads and her TV went from like the floor to the ceiling the thing is though you cannot cannot cannot blame these people they have never known anything else that you are born into the system you know what Democrats do is that they basically get people hooked on drugs the drug of free money you know and then they say that if you want your fix you have to keep voting for us I've seen firsthand the destruction caused by these Democrat policies and it's bad um you know it's very frustrating trying to discuss this subject with liberals about the welfare state because they are coming from a place that is theoretical that they've heard about in a classroom I've lived this and people do not realize just how toxic it is and how generational it is and how people are just being set up for failure it's bad so anyway I eventually clawed my way out of there I found my own place and now I had to deal with all of these things that had happened um you know I'm not gonna lie it was difficult for a long time I really struggled and you know I had a lot of depression and it was sort of you know almost like suicidal for a while you know I still have a scar on my hand from all the nights I went to sleep clutching a knife yes I know what you're thinking yes it changed my views on the Second Amendment but you know I got better I had to put the work in to be mentally well and be healthy and you know that's my responsibility I'm not a victim with these left it's as if they encourage emotional instability they want you to just do in your victimhood and you can't do that you know we can't help the cards were dealt in life we can't help the things that happen to us but whether you're a victim or a survivor is how you handle it is how you play those cards is what happens after I eventually got through it and found my strength and you know and the thing is the thing that made me feel better throughout this time were offensive off-color rape jokes I would seek out every one I could find every comedian and it is the only thing that like got me over it and these are the things they want to ban so anyway these things sort of stayed in the back of my mind but I never really connected the dots between them so a couple of years went by and now trigger warnings were everywhere you could not read a news article without a trigger warning especially on this subject so you know I'd put in all this work to be strong and be healthy and be well-adjusted and now I was being told that I'm some sort of victim who is too fragile and too damaged to even read a news article without a warning so anyway I'm a writer so I had a blog at the time that was basically like short stories funny things from my life and I decided to write a blog about this whole experience you know because I wanted to show a few things I wanted to show that this happens to men it happens to way more guys than anyone realizes it just isn't talked about there isn't the same level of education you know and I also want to give a perspective of strength and hue and not victimhood you know I wanted to show that people who have been through things like this in their life are tough strong resilient people we are not these fragile mentally ill china dolls that they'll have you believe and I also want to call out the hypocrisy of these activists so I wrote this blog and within 48 hours I had hundreds of messages from angry leftists and social justice warriors calling me every name in the world you know how dare you write this how dare you say you're not a victim women have it worse you know how dare you call out these activists when you should be thanking them thanking them that's funny you know telling me I'm making it up my favorite thing that they said was that simply by talking about how I fought back against my attacker that I am marginalizing and victimizing anyone who didn't first of all where do they all learn to talk the same no they all say the same buzzwords so according to them I have no ownership over my life and my story to even talk about it and this really showed me how liberals treat the people they claim to champion when one says something that they don't want to hear these people they didn't like how I was talking about it they want their victims to be crying and quivering and shaking in a corner and dependent on them and I was somebody who's standing tall not crying and saying I don't need you to trigger warnings so the thing is if the things that had happened years prior were set off the little spark in my mind this was the tank of gasoline on top of that because this happened right as the election was heating up it was like early 2016 so I'd always been very involved in politics I went to Iowa to campaign for Obama in 2008 I voted for him three times all my family are Democrats so initially I was like okay I'll be for Bernie but then I started researching things and realizing wait this doesn't add up none of this makes sense I you know I voted for him very half-heartedly because I didn't know what else to do and then I was like okay I'll be for Hillary and then I fell down the rabbit hole of research and I found out the history of the Democratic and I found out things that I had no clue were going on all this time you know I've been in a bubble for years of just watching MSNBC all day and I was finding out things that I had no clue were happening I didn't know that Obama took us from two wars to seven wars I didn't know that his cabinet was handpicked by Citigroup I didn't know all of these things about the Clinton Foundation all the things with foreign governments in Saudi Arabia Morocco and like all of the corruption all the things have been going on for so long and we're continuing to go on and the thing is all of these things that I was now learning were in such contrast to what I was hearing in the media and from friends and people saying oh you just hate her because she's a woman you know when no that was literally the only reason I even considered voting for her if you put a moment of thought into all of the things and think about what Democrats ever done for the people if they claimed to champion you know even every ounce of gay rights that has been made the past decade has simply been undoing Bill Clinton's policies my parents are both cancer survivors and the cost of their health insurance doubled and tripled under Obama care they really got screwed by it but it's as if it never even occurred to any of us you don't have to vote Democrat it is so programmed into you from school onwards that there are basically two identities that you can have in life you're one or the other Democrat or Nazi and that doesn't work for me my entire life I was led to believe that if somebody isn't a leftist and isn't a Democrat that they are just a homophobic racist sexist Nazi and I always believed that because I had never met anybody in New York who wasn't a Democrat but during that summer of 2016 I started making new friends and I started meeting all of these people who were conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and Republicans and I realized that they are nothing of the sort that we have most things in common even where we disagree and person after person that I would meet honestly showed me more kindness and more acceptance than these liberals ever did and certainly more than the gay community ever did and it really showed me how wrong these narratives are that are impounded into our heads so you know long story short or not short but long story long a sorry you guys for rambling so um but um anyway I left the Democratic Party and I became very outspoken against the left because I think that these are toxic bad regressive ideas that are bringing us backwards and making every group hate each other and they need to be actively fought against especially when you think about how much power they have they control every cultural institution so anyway in doing so I lost all my friends I lost probably about 90% of my friends for me at least it was a thousand times harder coming out as a centrist against the left than it was coming out as gay you know and then I found people like Dave Rubin and christina hoff sommers people who were finally saying the things that I had been feeling for years but just didn't have the language to be able to identify them as regressive leftist and that's what they are the thing is what Democrats do that is so genius but so evil is that they fuse their partisan policies together with people's identities so if you don't want the Christian Baker to be forced to bake the gay wedding cake you just take gay people if you oppose you know things like illegal immigration or the welfare state or whatever you just hate black people if you don't vote Hillary you just hate women and this is how they are able to control people by instilling fear if you don't go along if you ask questions if you don't just agree with them then you will be these names they call you and what I would really say to anybody who is like-minded that's afraid to speak out is to remember one thing there's no such thing as an insult something is either true or it is not true so it doesn't matter what they call you because a lot of people are afraid of being called all these things I've been called every name you can imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jew rape sir for all these things that they're supposed to stand for me I'm supposed to be I should have property of the DNC tattooed on my ass but you see how they treat anybody who asks questions anybody who challenges their dogma it is a religion and what I would really say to anybody who still supports this is where are things better where is one thing where we're better off where is one in since where people are more unified or get along better or anything of the sort I only see negative things what good is this doing who is this helping and if nothing maybe it's time to walk away and try something else so in conclusion I would just like to say that I think one thing that's really important for us who have walked away from the left is for us to not then take on the qualities that we walked away from to not buy into groupthink and tribalism I think it is incumbent on all of us to improve the right and it improved the Republican Party and take back the center so anyway thank you guys so much for listening and sorry for my long ramblings but anyway you know as a Russian bot in conclusion I will just say dosvedanya hey guys just wanted to add this as a PS as I said I'm a writer and I've created a TV show that is basically a walk away perspective of being gay and single and it's a very critical look at this conformist post modernist gay community I'm a little bit afraid I'll be blacklisted for speaking out against them and I've already been told it's offensive you'd never see a show like this in the mainstream so if you like what I have to say and that's a show you would like to see I'm gonna leave a link to the Kickstarter or check it out cigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarter alright sorry this video so long thank you so much for listening hit me up on the social medias if you'd like you well as a friend of mine once said once upon a time I was a liberal I'm not quite as good at the smoldery blue-steel sort of stares Brandon is but I'll do my best we are raised to be leftist we are raised to be loyal soldiers to the Democratic Party even when I was in high school but in public school the history teacher took the class on an illegal trip to Cuba to teach about the joys of

because I didn't know what else to do and then I was like okay I'll be for Hillary and then I fell down the rabbit hole of research and I found out the history of the Democratic and I found out things that I had no clue were going on all this time you know I've been in a bubble for years of just watching MSNBC all day and I was finding out things that I had no clue were happening I didn't know that Obama took us from two wars to seven wars I didn't know that his cabinet was handpicked by Citigroup I didn't know all of these things about the Clinton Foundation all the things with foreign governments in Saudi Arabia Morocco and like all of the corruption all the things have been going on for so long and we're continuing to go on and the thing is all of these things that I was now learning were in such contrast to what I was hearing in the media and from friends and people saying oh you just hate her because she's a woman you know when no that was literally the only reason I even considered voting for her if you put a moment of thought into all of the things and think about what Democrats ever done for the people if they claimed to champion you know even every ounce of gay rights that has been made the past decade has simply been undoing Bill Clinton's policies my parents are both cancer survivors and the cost of their health insurance doubled and tripled under Obama care they really got screwed by it but it's as if it never even occurred to any of us you don't have to vote Democrat it is so programmed into you from school onwards that there are basically two identities that you can have in life you're one or the other Democrat or Nazi and that doesn't work for me my entire life I was led to believe that if somebody isn't a leftist and isn't a Democrat that they are just a homophobic racist sexist Nazi and I always believed that because I had never met anybody in New York who wasn't a Democrat but during that summer of 2016 I started making new friends and I started meeting all of these people who were conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and Republicans and I realized that they are nothing of the sort that we have most things in common even where we disagree and person after person that I would meet honestly showed me more kindness and more acceptance than these liberals ever did and certainly more than the gay community ever did and it really showed me how wrong these narratives are that are impounded into our heads so you know long story short or not short but long story long a sorry you guys for rambling so um but um anyway I left the Democratic Party and I became very outspoken against the left because I think that these are toxic bad regressive ideas that are bringing us backwards and making every group hate each other and they need to be actively fought against especially when you think about how much power they have they control every cultural institution so anyway in doing so I lost all my friends I lost probably about 90% of my friends for me at least it was a thousand times harder coming out as a centrist against the left than it was coming out as gay you know and then I found people like Dave Rubin and christina hoff sommers people who were finally saying the things that I had been feeling for years but just didn't have the language to be able to identify them as regressive leftist and that's what they are the thing is what Democrats do that is so genius but so evil is that they fuse their partisan policies together with people's identities so if you don't want the Christian Baker to be forced to bake the gay wedding cake you just take gay people if you oppose you know things like illegal immigration or the welfare state or whatever you just hate black people if you don't vote Hillary you just hate women and this is how they are able to control people by instilling fear if you don't go along if you ask questions if you don't just agree with them then you will be these names they call you and what I would really say to anybody who is like-minded that's afraid to speak out is to remember one thing there's no such thing as an insult something is either true or it is not true so it doesn't matter what they call you because a lot of people are afraid of being called all these things I've been called every name you can imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jew rape sir for all these things that they're supposed to stand for me I'm supposed to be I should have property of the DNC tattooed on my ass but you see how they treat anybody who asks questions anybody who challenges their dogma it is a religion and what I would really say to anybody who still supports this is where are things better where is one thing where we're better off where is one in since where people are more unified or get along better or anything of the sort I only see negative things what good is this doing who is this helping and if nothing maybe it's time to walk away and try something else so in conclusion I would just like to say that I think one thing that's really important for us who have walked away from the left is for us to not then take on the qualities that we walked away from to not buy into groupthink and tribalism I think it is incumbent on all of us to improve the right and it improved the Republican Party and take back the center so anyway thank you guys so much for listening and sorry for my long ramblings but anyway you know as a Russian bot in conclusion I will just say dosvedanya hey guys just wanted to add this as a PS as I said I'm a writer and I've created a TV show that is basically a walk away perspective of being gay and single and it's a very critical look at this conformist post modernist gay community I'm a little bit afraid I'll be blacklisted for speaking out against them and I've already been told it's offensive you'd never see a show like this in the mainstream so if you like what I have to say and that's a show you would like to see I'm gonna leave a link to the Kickstarter or check it out cigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarter alright sorry this video so long thank you so much for listening hit me up on the social medias if you'd like you well as a friend of mine once said once upon a time I was a liberal I'm not quite as good at the smoldery blue-steel sort of stares Brandon is but I'll do my best we are raised to be leftist we are raised to be loyal soldiers to the Democratic Party even when I was in high school but in public school the history teacher took the class on an illegal trip to Cuba to teach about the joys of socialism and when they asked him why he was like oh well I'm a communist you know of course um you know this school they had no debate Club no civics club but there was communism club so you know it is just impounded in our heads at an early age I had always been a liberal but I never really bought into this whole collective [ __ ] I was always a rebel I was always different even in terms of being gay I never felt accepted by the gay community I never felt like I was part of them I always felt judged and they're mainly all about groupthink and conformity and looking speaking acting thinking exactly as they do and that was just never what I was about so I guess my red pill story is a little bit darker than some people's so I guess I'll just say that in summer of 2012 I had a home invasion sort of thing and I was raped sorry there's weird to talk about so openly you know without going into all the details I guess I was living in an apartment in Brooklyn with like five roommates and you know they were all leftist activists and all into drugs and one guy who was my roommate at the time was very closeted and so you know they moved out and I guess he kept his keys you know I was there alone five in the morning you know but anyway the point is at the time all of my friends were radical leftists you know male feminist social justice warriors rape activists the works those are favorite words all they ever talked about rape rape culture I hate the term by the way so I really thought that going to these people like wow they're experts in rape they you know it's all they talk about that I really thought they would support me and have my back and help me seek justice and all that that wasn't quite the reception I I learned very quickly that when this happens to a guy nobody wants to hear about it nobody will let you talk about it nobody cares I would try and talk about I needed to talk about it you know with my friends and nobody cared they would smile nod and immediately change the subject yet then every moment of every day I would be told by them well imagine how women feel and women have it worse and you know these women they can't walk down the street without being raped and you know oh these women they get raped and it ruins their lives and women women when you know it's as if they were telling me to just shut up because women have it worse I just couldn't believe the hypocrisy of these people at this time - it was all in the news about comedians and rape jokes and wanting to ban that so these same people then everyday we're just talking about how you know they're protesting some comedian and rape jokes and rape is never funny rape is never funny and I just thought to myself in that moment I was like you know I don't know how I don't know when but someday I'm gonna find a way to laugh about what happened to me just to spite them so it is this time to that I noticed how politically correct everyone was becoming that you could not say a word without being called some sort of name this one time I had gone on a really awkward date with this guy where he asked if he could kiss me um so when I like told friends about this I wrote a post that you know it's very unattractive when someone asks to kiss you these same people then jump down my throat you're a sexist and you need affirmative consent and you're advocating rape you're a rape apologist you know knowing what I had just gone through so this is how they treat people that they claim to champion you know but anyway there were a couple of instances that led to my red pill hang so if that was the first one the second was this now after this happened obviously I had to get out of that apartment I couldn't be there but it was the middle of the month I know where to go I had no money I couldn't find an apartment so I ended up calling some room rental service where you can just move in that day so they said they had a place super cheap Lower East Side in Manhattan great neighborhood I was like perfect I'll take it so I show up there with my things it's in the projects I lived in the projects for about a month and a half now let me tell you something you cannot live in the projects for any amount of time and come out of there illiberal it's not possible I think I was very ignorant as to just how dangerous it was you know in retrospect I really don't know how I survived especially looking like an emaciated albino alien vampire like I do but I think people don't realize just how bad the situation is in places like that it's bad the people there are so dangerous you know assaulting people mugging people there's piss and [ __ ] everywhere and you know needles hanging out of their arms and those are the good ones you know so anyway the woman who I was renting the room in her apartment she was 26 years old for kids from four different fathers most of them incarcerated and you know when I asked her what do you do she said I'm in the system as her parents were as her kids will be you know that's the situation when you are put on welfare you are meant to stay there so you know and she would tell me about how like the buzzwords she would use to get more money and if you have more kids you get more money and you know meanwhile every day she would come home with shopping bags of like X boxes and iPads and her TV went from like the floor to the ceiling the thing is though you cannot cannot cannot blame these people they have never known anything else that you are born into the system you know what Democrats do is that they basically get people hooked on drugs the drug of free money you know and then they say that if you want your fix you have to keep voting for us I've seen firsthand the destruction caused by these Democrat policies and it's bad um you know it's very frustrating trying to discuss this subject with liberals about the welfare state because they are coming from a place that is theoretical that they've heard about in a classroom I've lived this and people do not realize just how toxic it is and how generational it is and how people are just being set up for failure it's bad so anyway I eventually clawed my way out of there I found my own place and now I had to deal with all of these things that had happened um you know I'm not gonna lie it was difficult for a long time I really struggled and you know I had a lot of depression and it was sort of you know almost like suicidal for a while you know I still have a scar on my hand from all the nights I went to sleep clutching a knife yes I know what you're thinking yes it changed my views on the Second Amendment but you know I got better I had to put the work in to be mentally well and be healthy and you know that's my responsibility I'm not a victim with these left it's as if they encourage emotional instability they want you to just do in your victimhood and you can't do that you know we can't help the cards were dealt in life we can't help the things that happen to us but whether you're a victim or a survivor is how you handle it is how you play those cards is what happens after I eventually got through it and found my strength and you know and the thing is the thing that made me feel better throughout this time were offensive off-color rape jokes I would seek out every one I could find every comedian and it is the only thing that like got me over it and these are the things they want to ban so anyway these things sort of stayed in the back of my mind but I never really connected the dots between them so a couple of years went by and now trigger warnings were everywhere you could not read a news article without a trigger warning especially on this subject so you know I'd put in all this work to be strong and be healthy and be well-adjusted and now I was being told that I'm some sort of victim who is too fragile and too damaged to even read a news article without a warning so anyway I'm a writer so I had a blog at the time that was basically like short stories funny things from my life and I decided to write a blog about this whole experience you know because I wanted to show a few things I wanted to show that this happens to men it happens to way more guys than anyone realizes it just isn't talked about there isn't the same level of education you know and I also want to give a perspective of strength and hue and not victimhood you know I wanted to show that people who have been through things like this in their life are tough strong resilient people we are not these fragile mentally ill china dolls that they'll have you believe and I also want to call out the hypocrisy of these activists so I wrote this blog and within 48 hours I had hundreds of messages from angry leftists and social justice warriors calling me every name in the world you know how dare you write this how dare you say you're not a victim women have it worse you know how dare you call out these activists when you should be thanking them thanking them that's funny you know telling me I'm making it up my favorite thing that they said was that simply by talking about how I fought back against my attacker that I am marginalizing and victimizing anyone who didn't first of all where do they all learn to talk the same no they all say the same buzzwords so according to them I have no ownership over my life and my story to even talk about it and this really showed me how liberals treat the people they claim to champion when one says something that they don't want to hear these people they didn't like how I was talking about it they want their victims to be crying and quivering and shaking in a corner and dependent on them and I was somebody who's standing tall not crying and saying I don't need you to trigger warnings so the thing is if the things that had happened years prior were set off the little spark in my mind this was the tank of gasoline on top of that because this happened right as the election was heating up it was like early 2016 so I'd always been very involved in politics I went to Iowa to campaign for Obama in 2008 I voted for him three times all my family are Democrats so initially I was like okay I'll be for Bernie but then I started researching things and realizing wait this doesn't add up none of this makes sense I you know I voted for him very half-heartedly

you,"Well, as a friend of mine once said once upon a time, I was a liberal I'm, not quite as good at the smoldery blue-steel sort of stares Brandon is but I'll do my best. We are raised to be leftist. We are raised to be loyal soldiers to the Democratic Party, even when I was in high school, but in public school the history teacher took the class on an illegal trip to Cuba to teach about the joys of socialism and when they asked him why he was like oh well, I'm a communist. You know, of course, um. You know this school. They had no debate, Club no civics club, but there was communism club. So you know it is just impounded in our heads at an early age, I had always been a liberal, but I never really bought into this whole collective [, __, ] I, was always a rebel. I was always different, even in terms of being gay I never felt accepted by the gay community. I never felt like I was part of them. I always felt judged and they're mainly all about groupthink and conformity and looking speaking acting thinking exactly as they do, and that was just never what I was about so I guess. My red pill story is a little bit darker than some people's, so I guess I'll just say that in summer of 2012, I had a home invasion, sort of thing and I was raped. Sorry, there's weird to talk about so openly. You know, without going into all the details, I guess I was living in an apartment in Brooklyn with like five roommates, and you know they were all leftist activists and all into drugs, and one guy who was my roommate at the time was very closeted, and so you know they moved out and I guess he kept his keys. You know I was there alone five in the morning, you know, but anyway, the point is at the time all of my friends were radical leftists, you know: male feminist social justice warriors rape activists, the works, those are favorite words all they ever talked about: rape, rape, culture, I, hate the term. By the way, so I really thought that going to these people like wow they're experts in rape, they you know it's all. They talk about that. I really thought they would support me and have my back and help me seek justice and all that that wasn't quite the reception, I I learned very quickly that when this happens to a guy, nobody wants to hear about it. Nobody will let you talk about it. Nobody cares. I would try and talk about I needed to talk about it. You know with my friends and nobody cared. They would smile nod and immediately change the subject. Yet then, every moment of every day I would be told by them. Well imagine how women feel and women have it worse, and you know these women. They can't walk down the street without being raped, and you know oh these women they get raped and it ruins their lives and women women. When you know it's as if they were telling me to just shut up because women have it worse, I just couldn't believe the hypocrisy of these people at this time -. It was all in the news about comedians and rape jokes and wanting to ban that. So these same people then everyday we're just talking about how you know they're protesting some comedian and rape, jokes and rape is never funny. Rape is never funny and I just thought to myself. In that moment, I was like you know: I, don't know how I don't know when, but someday I'm gonna find a way to laugh about what happened to me just to spite them. So it is this time to that. I noticed how politically correct everyone was becoming that you could not say a word without being called some sort of name. This one time I had gone on a really awkward date with this guy, where he asked if he could kiss me um. So when I, like told friends about this, I wrote a post that you know it's very unattractive. When someone asks to kiss you these same people, then jump down my throat you're a sexist, and you need affirmative consent and you're, advocating rape you're a rape apologist. You know knowing what I had just gone through, so this is how they treat people that they claim to champion. You know, but anyway, there were a couple of instances that led to my red pill hang so if that was the first one. The second was this now after this happened. Obviously I had to get out of that apartment. I couldn't be there, but it was the middle of the month. I know where to go. I had no money, I couldn't find an apartment, so I ended up calling some room rental service, where you can just move in that day. So they said they had a place. Super cheap, Lower, East Side in Manhattan, great neighborhood I, was like perfect I'll. Take it so I show up there with my things. It's in the projects I lived in the projects for about a month and a half. Now let me tell you something: you cannot live in the projects for any amount of time and come out of there. Illiberal it's not possible I. Think I was very ignorant as to just how dangerous it was. You know in retrospect, I really don't know how I survived, especially looking like an emaciated albino alien vampire, like I, do but I think people don't realize just how bad the situation is in places like that. It's bad the people there are so dangerous. You know assaulting people, mugging people, there's piss and [ __ ] everywhere, and you know needles hanging out of their arms and those are the good ones you know so anyway, the woman who I was renting the room in her apartment. She was 26 years old for kids from four different fathers, most of them incarcerated, and you know when I asked her. What do you do? She said I'm in the system, as her parents were as her kids will be. You know that's the situation when you are put on welfare. You are meant to stay there, so you know, and she would tell me about how, like the buzzwords, she would use to get more money, and if you have more kids, you get more money and you know meanwhile, every day she would come home with shopping bags of like X boxes and iPads, and her TV went from like the floor to the ceiling. The thing is, though, you cannot cannot, cannot blame these people. They have never known anything else that you are born into the system. You know what Democrats do is that they basically get people hooked on drugs, the drug of free money, you know, and then they say that if you want your fix, you have to keep voting for us. I've seen firsthand the destruction caused by these Democrat policies and it's bad um. You know it's very frustrating trying to discuss this subject with liberals about the welfare state because they are coming from a place that is theoretical. That they've heard about in a classroom. I've lived this and people do not realize just how toxic it is and how generational it is and how people are just being set up for failure. It's bad so anyway, I eventually clawed my way out of there. I found my own place and now I had to deal with all of these things that had happened. Um, you know, I'm not gonna lie. It was difficult for a long time. I really struggled, and you know, I had a lot of depression and it was sort of you know almost like suicidal for a while. You know I still have a scar on my hand from all the nights. I went to sleep clutching a knife. Yes, I know what you're thinking. Yes, it changed. My views on the Second Amendment, but you know I got better. I had to put the work in to be mentally well and be healthy, and you know that's my responsibility: I'm, not a victim with these left, it's as if they encourage emotional instability. They want you to just do in your victimhood and you can't do that. You know we can't help the cards were dealt in life. We can't help the things that happen to us, but whether you're a victim or a survivor is how you handle it is how you play those cards is what happens after I eventually got through it and found my strength, and you know, and the thing is the thing that made me feel better throughout this time were offensive. Off-Color rape, jokes I, would seek out every one I could find every comedian, and it is the only thing that like got me over it, and these are the things they want to ban so anyway, these things sort of stayed in the back of my mind, but I never really connected the dots between them. So a couple of years went by and now trigger warnings were everywhere. You could not read a news article without a trigger warning, especially on this subject. So you know I'd put in all this work to be strong and be healthy and be well-adjusted, and now I was being told that I'm some sort of victim who is too fragile and too damaged to even read a news article without a warning. So anyway, I'm a writer, so I had a blog at the time. That was basically like short stories. Funny things from my life and I decided to write a blog about this whole experience. You know, because I wanted to show a few things. I wanted to show that this happens to men. It happens to way more guys than anyone realizes it. Just isn't talked about. There isn't the same level of education. You know, and I also want to give a perspective of strength and hue and not victimhood. You know I wanted to show that people who have been through things like this in their life are tough, strong, resilient people. We are not these fragile, mentally ill. China dolls that they'll have you believe and I also want to call out the hypocrisy of these activists. So I wrote this blog and within 48 hours, I had hundreds of messages from angry leftists and social justice warriors calling me every name in the world. You know how dare you write this? How dare you say, you're, not a victim women. Have it worse. You know how dare you call out these activists when you should be thanking them, thanking them? That's funny, you know telling me I'm, making it up my favorite thing that they said was that simply by talking about how I fought back against my attacker, that I am marginalizing and victimizing. Anyone who didn't first of all, where do they all learn to talk the same? No, they all say the same buzzwords so according to them, I have no ownership over my life and my story to even talk about it, and this really showed me how liberals treat the people they claim to champion when one says something that they don't want to hear these people they didn't like how I was talking about it. They want their victims to be crying and quivering and shaking in a corner and dependent on them and I was somebody who's standing tall, not crying and saying, I, don't need you to trigger warnings, so the thing is if the things that had happened years prior were set off the little spark. In my mind, this was the tank of gasoline. On top of that, because this happened right as the election was heating up, it was like early 2016, so I'd always been very involved in politics. I went to Iowa to campaign for Obama in 2008, I voted for him three times all my family are Democrats, so initially I was like okay I'll be for Bernie, but then I started researching things and realizing wait. This doesn't add up. None of this makes sense I. You know I voted for him very half-heartedly, because I didn't know what else to do, and then I was like okay, I'll be for Hillary, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of research and I found out the history of the Democratic and I found out things that I had no clue were going on all this time. You know, I've been in a bubble for years of just watching MSNBC all day and I was finding out things that I had no clue were happening. I didn't know that Obama took us from two wars to seven wars. I didn't know that his cabinet was handpicked by Citigroup. I didn't know all of these things about the Clinton Foundation, all the things with foreign governments in Saudi, Arabia, Morocco and like all of the corruption, all the things have been going on for so long and we're continuing to go on, and the thing is all of these things that I was now learning were in such contrast to what I was hearing in the media and from friends and people saying. Oh, you just hate her because she's a woman, you know when no, that was literally the only reason, I even considered voting for her. If you put a moment of thought into all of the things and think about what Democrats ever done for the people, if they claimed to champion you know, even every ounce of gay rights that has been made, the past decade has simply been undoing. Bill Clinton's policies, my parents are both cancer survivors and the cost of their health insurance doubled and tripled under Obama care. They really got screwed by it, but it's as if it never even occurred to any of us. You don't have to vote Democrat. It is so programmed into you from school onwards that there are basically two identities that you can have in life, you're, one or the other, Democrat or Nazi, and that doesn't work for me. My entire life I was led to believe that if somebody isn't a leftist and isn't a Democrat that they are just a homophobic, racist, sexist Nazi and I always believed that, because I had never met anybody in New York who wasn't a Democrat, but during that summer of 2016 I started making new friends and I started meeting all of these people, who were conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and Republicans and I, realized that they are nothing of the sort that we have most things in common, even where we disagree and person after person that I would meet honestly showed me more kindness and more acceptance than these liberals ever did, and certainly more than the gay community ever did, and it really showed me how wrong these narratives are that are impounded into our heads. So you know long story short or not short, but long story. Long, a sorry you guys for rambling, so um, but um anyway, I left the Democratic, Party and I became very outspoken against the left, because I think that these are toxic, bad, regressive ideas that are bringing us backwards and making every group hate each other and they need to be actively fought against, especially when you think about how much power they have. They control every cultural institution. So anyway, in doing so, I lost all my friends. I lost, probably about 90% of my friends. For me at least, it was a thousand times harder coming out as a centrist against the left than it was coming out as gay. You know, and then I found people like Dave Rubin and christina hoff, sommers people who were finally saying the things that I had been feeling for years, but just didn't have the language to be able to identify them as regressive leftist and that's what they are. The thing is: what Democrats do that is so genius, but so evil is that they fuse their partisan policies together with people's identities. So if you don't want the Christian Baker to be forced to bake the gay wedding cake, you just take gay people. If you oppose you know things like illegal immigration or the welfare state or whatever you just hate black people. If you don't vote Hillary, you just hate women, and this is how they are able to control people by instilling fear. If you don't go along. If you ask questions, if you don't just agree with them, then you will be these names, they call you and what I would really say to anybody who is like-minded. That's afraid to speak out is to remember one thing: there's no such thing as an insult. Something is either true or it is not true, so it doesn't matter what they call you, because a lot of people are afraid of being called all these things, I've been called every name. You can imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jew rape, sir, for all, these things that they're supposed to stand for me, I'm supposed to be I, should have property of the DNC tattooed on my ass, but you see how they treat anybody who asks questions, anybody who challenges their dogma. It is a religion and what I would really say to anybody who still supports this is where are things better? Where is one thing where we're better off? Where is one in since, where people are more unified or get along better or anything of the sort, I only see negative things. What good is this doing? Who is this helping and if nothing, maybe it's time to walk away and try something else? So in conclusion, I would just like to say that I think one thing that's really important for us who have walked away from the left is for us to not then take on the qualities that we walked away from to not buy into groupthink and tribalism. I think it is incumbent on all of us to improve the right and it improved the Republican Party and take back the center so anyway, thank you guys so much for listening and sorry for my long ramblings. But anyway, you know as a Russian bot. In conclusion, I will just say: dosvedanya, hey guys, just wanted to add this as a PS as I said, I'm a writer and I've created a TV show that is basically a walk away perspective of being gay and single, and it's a very critical look at this conformist post, modernist gay community I'm a little bit afraid I'll be blacklisted for speaking out against them and I've already been told. It's offensive you'd never see a show like this in the mainstream. So if you like what I have to say and that's a show, you would like to see I'm gonna leave a link to the Kickstarter or check it out cigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarter. Alright, sorry, this video so long! Thank you so much for listening hit me up on the social medias. If you'd, like you well as a friend of mine, once said once upon a time, I was a liberal I'm, not quite as good at the smoldery blue-steel sort of stares Brandon is but I'll do my best. We are raised to be leftist. We are raised to be loyal soldiers to the Democratic Party, even when I was in high school, but in public school the history teacher took the class on an illegal trip to Cuba to teach about the joys of socialism and when they asked him why he was like oh well, I'm, a communist. You know, of course, um. You know this school. They had no debate, Club no civics club, but there was communism club. So you know it is just impounded in our heads at an early age, I had always been a liberal, but I never really bought into this whole collective [, __, ] I, was always a rebel. I was always different, even in terms of being gay I never felt accepted by the gay community. I never felt like I was part of them. I always felt judged and they're mainly all about groupthink and conformity and looking speaking acting thinking exactly as they do, and that was just never what I was about so I guess. My red pill story is a little bit darker than some people's, so I guess I'll just say that in summer of 2012, I had a home invasion, sort of thing and I was raped. Sorry, there's weird to talk about so openly. You know, without going into all the details, I guess I was living in an apartment in Brooklyn with like five roommates, and you know they were all leftist activists and all into drugs, and one guy who was my roommate at the time was very closeted, and so you know they moved out and I guess he kept his keys. You know I was there alone five in the morning, you know, but anyway, the point is at the time all of my friends were radical leftists, you know: male feminist social justice warriors rape activists, the works, those are favorite words all they ever talked about: rape, rape, culture, I, hate the term. By the way, so I really thought that going to these people like wow they're experts in rape, they you know it's all. They talk about that. I really thought they would support me and have my back and help me seek justice and all that that wasn't quite the reception, I I learned very quickly that when this happens to a guy, nobody wants to hear about it. Nobody will let you talk about it. Nobody cares. I would try and talk about I needed to talk about it. You know with my friends and nobody cared. They would smile nod and immediately change the subject. Yet then, every moment of every day I would be told by them. Well imagine how women feel and women have it worse, and you know these women. They can't walk down the street without being raped, and you know oh these women they get raped and it ruins their lives and women women. When you know it's as if they were telling me to just shut up because women have it worse, I just couldn't believe the hypocrisy of these people at this time -. It was all in the news about comedians and rape jokes and wanting to ban that. So these same people then everyday we're just talking about how you know they're protesting some comedian and rape, jokes and rape is never funny. Rape is never funny and I just thought to myself. In that moment, I was like you know: I, don't know how I don't know when, but someday I'm gonna find a way to laugh about what happened to me just to spite them. So it is this time to that. I noticed how politically correct everyone was becoming that you could not say a word without being called some sort of name. This one time I had gone on a really awkward date with this guy, where he asked if he could kiss me um. So when I, like told friends about this, I wrote a post that you know it's very unattractive. When someone asks to kiss you these same people, then jump down my throat you're a sexist, and you need affirmative consent and you're, advocating rape you're a rape apologist. You know knowing what I had just gone through, so this is how they treat people that they claim to champion. You know, but anyway, there were a couple of instances that led to my red pill hang so if that was the first one. The second was this now after this happened. Obviously I had to get out of that apartment. I couldn't be there, but it was the middle of the month. I know where to go. I had no money, I couldn't find an apartment, so I ended up calling some room rental service, where you can just move in that day. So they said they had a place. Super cheap, Lower, East Side in Manhattan, great neighborhood I, was like perfect I'll. Take it so I show up there with my things. It's in the projects I lived in the projects for about a month and a half. Now let me tell you something: you cannot live in the projects for any amount of time and come out of there. Illiberal it's not possible I. Think I was very ignorant as to just how dangerous it was. You know in retrospect, I really don't know how I survived, especially looking like an emaciated albino alien vampire, like I, do but I think people don't realize just how bad the situation is in places like that. It's bad the people there are so dangerous. You know assaulting people, mugging people, there's piss and [ __ ] everywhere, and you know needles hanging out of their arms and those are the good ones you know so anyway, the woman who I was renting the room in her apartment. She was 26 years old for kids from four different fathers, most of them incarcerated, and you know when I asked her. What do you do? She said I'm in the system, as her parents were as her kids will be. You know that's the situation when you are put on welfare. You are meant to stay there, so you know, and she would tell me about how, like the buzzwords, she would use to get more money, and if you have more kids, you get more money and you know meanwhile, every day she would come home with shopping bags of like X boxes and iPads, and her TV went from like the floor to the ceiling. The thing is, though, you cannot cannot, cannot blame these people. They have never known anything else that you are born into the system. You know what Democrats do is that they basically get people hooked on drugs, the drug of free money, you know, and then they say that if you want your fix, you have to keep voting for us. I've seen firsthand the destruction caused by these Democrat policies and it's bad um. You know it's very frustrating trying to discuss this subject with liberals about the welfare state because they are coming from a place that is theoretical. That they've heard about in a classroom. I've lived this and people do not realize just how toxic it is and how generational it is and how people are just being set up for failure. It's bad so anyway, I eventually clawed my way out of there. I found my own place and now I had to deal with all of these things that had happened. Um, you know, I'm not gonna lie. It was difficult for a long time. I really struggled, and you know, I had a lot of depression and it was sort of you know almost like suicidal for a while. You know I still have a scar on my hand from all the nights. I went to sleep clutching a knife. Yes, I know what you're thinking. Yes, it changed. My views on the Second Amendment, but you know I got better. I had to put the work in to be mentally well and be healthy, and you know that's my responsibility: I'm, not a victim with these left, it's as if they encourage emotional instability. They want you to just do in your victimhood and you can't do that. You know we can't help the cards were dealt in life. We can't help the things that happen to us, but whether you're a victim or a survivor is how you handle it is how you play those cards is what happens after I eventually got through it and found my strength, and you know, and the thing is the thing that made me feel better throughout this time were offensive. Off-Color rape, jokes I, would seek out every one I could find every comedian, and it is the only thing that like got me over it, and these are the things they want to ban so anyway, these things sort of stayed in the back of my mind, but I never really connected the dots between them. So a couple of years went by and now trigger warnings were everywhere. You could not read a news article without a trigger warning, especially on this subject. So you know I'd put in all this work to be strong and be healthy and be well-adjusted, and now I was being told that I'm some sort of victim who is too fragile and too damaged to even read a news article without a warning. So anyway, I'm a writer, so I had a blog at the time. That was basically like short stories. Funny things from my life and I decided to write a blog about this whole experience. You know, because I wanted to show a few things. I wanted to show that this happens to men. It happens to way more guys than anyone realizes it. Just isn't talked about. There isn't the same level of education. You know, and I also want to give a perspective of strength and hue and not victimhood. You know I wanted to show that people who have been through things like this in their life are tough, strong, resilient people. We are not these fragile, mentally ill. China dolls that they'll have you believe and I also want to call out the hypocrisy of these activists. So I wrote this blog and within 48 hours, I had hundreds of messages from angry leftists and social justice warriors calling me every name in the world. You know how dare you write this? How dare you say, you're, not a victim women. Have it worse. You know how dare you call out these activists when you should be thanking them, thanking them? That's funny, you know telling me I'm, making it up my favorite thing that they said was that simply by talking about how I fought back against my attacker, that I am marginalizing and victimizing. Anyone who didn't first of all, where do they all learn to talk the same? No, they all say the same buzzwords so according to them, I have no ownership over my life and my story to even talk about it, and this really showed me how liberals treat the people they claim to champion when one says something that they don't want to hear these people they didn't like how I was talking about it. They want their victims to be crying and quivering and shaking in a corner and dependent on them and I was somebody who's standing tall, not crying and saying, I, don't need you to trigger warnings, so the thing is if the things that had happened years prior were set off the little spark. In my mind, this was the tank of gasoline. On top of that, because this happened right as the election was heating up, it was like early 2016, so I'd always been very involved in politics. I went to Iowa to campaign for Obama in 2008, I voted for him three times all my family are Democrats, so initially I was like okay I'll be for Bernie, but then I started researching things and realizing wait. This doesn't add up. None of this makes sense I. You know I voted for him very half-heartedly, because I didn't know what else to do, and then I was like okay, I'll be for Hillary, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of research and I found out the history of the Democratic and I found out things that I had no clue were going on all this time. You know, I've been in a bubble for years of just watching MSNBC all day and I was finding out things that I had no clue were happening. I didn't know that Obama took us from two wars to seven wars. I didn't know that his cabinet was handpicked by Citigroup. I didn't know all of these things about the Clinton Foundation, all the things with foreign governments in Saudi, Arabia, Morocco and like all of the corruption, all the things have been going on for so long and we're continuing to go on, and the thing is all of these things that I was now learning were in such contrast to what I was hearing in the media and from friends and people saying. Oh, you just hate her because she's a woman, you know when no, that was literally the only reason, I even considered voting for her. If you put a moment of thought into all of the things and think about what Democrats ever done for the people, if they claimed to champion you know, even every ounce of gay rights that has been made, the past decade has simply been undoing. Bill Clinton's policies, my parents are both cancer survivors and the cost of their health insurance doubled and tripled under Obama care. They really got screwed by it, but it's as if it never even occurred to any of us. You don't have to vote Democrat. It is so programmed into you from school onwards that there are basically two identities that you can have in life, you're, one or the other, Democrat or Nazi, and that doesn't work for me. My entire life I was led to believe that if somebody isn't a leftist and isn't a Democrat that they are just a homophobic, racist, sexist Nazi and I always believed that, because I had never met anybody in New York who wasn't a Democrat, but during that summer of 2016 I started making new friends and I started meeting all of these people, who were conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and Republicans and I, realized that they are nothing of the sort that we have most things in common, even where we disagree and person after person that I would meet honestly showed me more kindness and more acceptance than these liberals ever did, and certainly more than the gay community ever did, and it really showed me how wrong these narratives are that are impounded into our heads.

You know, I've been in a bubble for years of just watching MSNBC all day and I was finding out things that I had no clue were happening. I didn't know that Obama took us from two wars to seven wars. I didn't know that his cabinet was handpicked by Citigroup. I didn't know all of these things about the Clinton Foundation, all the things with foreign governments in Saudi, Arabia, Morocco and like all of the corruption, all the things have been going on for so long and we're continuing to go on, and the thing is all of these things that I was now learning were in such contrast to what I was hearing in the media and from friends and people saying. Oh, you just hate her because she's a woman, you know when no, that was literally the only reason, I even considered voting for her. If you put a moment of thought into all of the things and think about what Democrats ever done for the people, if they claimed to champion you know, even every ounce of gay rights that has been made, the past decade has simply been undoing. Bill Clinton's policies, my parents are both cancer survivors and the cost of their health insurance doubled and tripled under Obama care. They really got screwed by it, but it's as if it never even occurred to any of us. You don't have to vote Democrat. It is so programmed into you from school onwards that there are basically two identities that you can have in life, you're, one or the other, Democrat or Nazi, and that doesn't work for me. My entire life I was led to believe that if somebody isn't a leftist and isn't a Democrat that they are just a homophobic, racist, sexist Nazi and I always believed that, because I had never met anybody in New York who wasn't a Democrat, but during that summer of 2016 I started making new friends and I started meeting all of these people, who were conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and Republicans and I, realized that they are nothing of the sort that we have most things in common, even where we disagree and person after person that I would meet honestly showed me more kindness and more acceptance than these liberals ever did, and certainly more than the gay community ever did, and it really showed me how wrong these narratives are that are impounded into our heads. So you know long story short or not short, but long story. Long, a sorry you guys for rambling, so um, but um anyway, I left the Democratic, Party and I became very outspoken against the left, because I think that these are toxic, bad, regressive ideas that are bringing us backwards and making every group hate each other and they need to be actively fought against, especially when you think about how much power they have. They control every cultural institution. So anyway, in doing so, I lost all my friends. I lost, probably about 90% of my friends. For me at least, it was a thousand times harder coming out as a centrist against the left than it was coming out as gay. You know, and then I found people like Dave Rubin and christina hoff, sommers people who were finally saying the things that I had been feeling for years, but just didn't have the language to be able to identify them as regressive leftist and that's what they are. The thing is: what Democrats do that is so genius, but so evil is that they fuse their partisan policies together with people's identities. So if you don't want the Christian Baker to be forced to bake the gay wedding cake, you just take gay people. If you oppose you know things like illegal immigration or the welfare state or whatever you just hate black people. If you don't vote Hillary, you just hate women, and this is how they are able to control people by instilling fear. If you don't go along. If you ask questions, if you don't just agree with them, then you will be these names, they call you and what I would really say to anybody who is like-minded. That's afraid to speak out is to remember one thing: there's no such thing as an insult. Something is either true or it is not true, so it doesn't matter what they call you, because a lot of people are afraid of being called all these things, I've been called every name. You can imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jew rape, sir, for all, these things that they're supposed to stand for me, I'm supposed to be I, should have property of the DNC tattooed on my ass, but you see how they treat anybody who asks questions, anybody who challenges their dogma. It is a religion and what I would really say to anybody who still supports this is where are things better? Where is one thing where we're better off? Where is one in since, where people are more unified or get along better or anything of the sort, I only see negative things. What good is this doing? Who is this helping and if nothing, maybe it's time to walk away and try something else? So in conclusion, I would just like to say that I think one thing that's really important for us who have walked away from the left is for us to not then take on the qualities that we walked away from to not buy into groupthink and tribalism. I think it is incumbent on all of us to improve the right and it improved the Republican Party and take back the center so anyway, thank you guys so much for listening and sorry for my long ramblings. But anyway, you know as a Russian bot. In conclusion, I will just say: dosvedanya, hey guys, just wanted to add this as a PS as I said, I'm a writer and I've created a TV show that is basically a walk away perspective of being gay and single, and it's a very critical look at this conformist post, modernist gay community I'm a little bit afraid I'll be blacklisted for speaking out against them and I've already been told. It's offensive you'd never see a show like this in the mainstream. So if you like what I have to say and that's a show, you would like to see I'm gonna leave a link to the Kickstarter or check it out cigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarter. Alright, sorry, this video so long! Thank you so much for listening hit me up on the social medias. If you'd like you."

The first time I went shopping, I had candy coins in my pockets, children around me and they were laughing, and then there was more children and more children and then I ran out of candy and coins and they became a mob and they were angry and I learned. My lesson. The next time I went shopping, I picked a boy to watch my car and a boy to make each stop with me and in one fell swoop. Instead of beggars, I created entrepreneurs fast-forward to World, Trade, Center, bombing, September 11th awful time. I wasn't political, though even during the Obama years, I just you know, kept my head down and then in 2014. In Texas, we had an unaccompanied minor crisis and I realized that the things I heard on the news and the things I saw on the ground were two different things, not just nationally but locally, and so I quit NBC. After 45 years, I quit ABC CBS, not too hard CNN a little harder, because I watched them internationally, I loved Christiane, Amanpour, I, loved Vahid Zakaria, but I'm with Fox now and I'm good Donald Trump came along. He was my seventeenth choice of seventeen I wasn't sure. I was gonna, be able to do it, but now I realized why he was our guy. Yes, somebody needs to take out that Twitter finger. Yes, he says the things sometimes, but he's so good at solving a problem. He sees it. He solves it. I love that about him. I love that he talks to us instead of around us, I love that if he does the wrong thing, he'll change tack, he's not afraid to do that. I'll vote for him in 2020 last thing, I want to say, is to all these sweet people that are providing these wonderful testimonies, you're. Also not bots. We have white bread. Like me, we have immigrants, veterans, old, Democrat, hippies, couple pot, heads gay, lesbian, trans, black Latino. It was a Samoan guy today, we're all a big group. We don't agree on platform many times a lot of people are still fairly Democrat, but what we have agreed to do is not further the hate and find a place where you can have discourse I, think that's awesome, but those folks, you know the groups like the gay, lesbian trans, the people of color, the Latino, it's harder for you, you're, very brave and I just wanted to shout out to you. Thank you because you're gonna be the bridge for us. You reach areas of the population that I have no credit with and to all our friends who are not our friends yet and you're. Still in the dark side, we'll be waiting for you here, you come on back when they sit when they start to go over the precipice. You just come on back and join us here. You know when you walk away."

99,bAvXJ8wZfxc,hi everyone i became aware of brandon and his walk away campaign about a year ago i was absolutely amazed at a man that had been persecuted for who he is and he decided to put this thing together and i was very very grateful because it's something that this country really really needs whether you're black white gay straight it just doesn't matter okay my story is a pretty calm compared to most but i'm going to say it because brandon asks us to because he's being censored here goes i came from a democratic family nobody was real crazy about voting but it was all democratic when i was 17 in high school i needed to be an intern rather than go to regular school for arizona government and united states government so i ended up working as an intern in the u.s senate and also in the state senate six months and one three months in the other well what i saw was pretty disgusting a lot of lies a lot of things that didn't make sense um probably the most extreme was when the bills were coming up that i really thought needed to be passed that i everybody just wanted to do deals they didn't care what was on the paper that last month was just basically about you help me with mine i'll help you with yours and we don't care what's on the paper it's just a matter of doing favors so it really messed me up inside when it came to politics i saw dishonesty and i didn't want anything to do with it fast forward to the obama era we'll call it that um i was absolutely amazed at a man that would say one thing and do another i would i would watch a speech or two and i'd go wow he sounds great but there's a wolf in sheep's clothing here something's not right and i just noticed that our country was going downhill now i've always been in business and i know how to run a business and i think gosh if we just run the company like a business if we just run the country like a business everything would be great well enter prior to 2016 donald trump of all people wants to run that to me sounded crazy but then on the other side you've got the hillary and i thought no wait a minute something's different something is very very different here and through our church i'm not going to get into any of that but it was it was very obvious and we realized that donald trump was chosen to do this there was absolutely no doubt and so i voted for the first time i voted and i voted republican and it had nothing to do with republican democrat libertarian or anything it had to do with what was right who was being honest so i changed i walked away and i've been wanting to write down my story for a long time and i haven't and if you fast forward from 2016 to now it's absolutely amazing what donald trump has had to put up with now think about it who but him and his personality could have put up with anything that's been going on all he wants to do is take care of this country and love in this country and make us prosperous make america great that's what he's done and if it hadn't been for this covid things would have been even better but they're still good and they're going to get better we need more for four more years and we need to support brandon and we need to make sure that these videos are not censored okay that's why he said do this that's why i'm doing it it's 4 30 in the morning here in texas and go brandon thank you very much for everything you do and yes i walked away you,"Hi everyone I became aware of brandon and his walk away campaign about a year ago. I was absolutely amazed at a man that had been persecuted for who he is, and he decided to put this thing together, and I was very very grateful because it's something that this country really really needs, whether you're black white, gay straight. It just doesn't matter. Okay, my story is a pretty calm compared to most, but I'm going to say it because brandon asks us to because he's being censored here goes. I came from a democratic family. Nobody was real crazy about voting, but it was all democratic. When I was 17 in high school, I needed to be an intern rather than go to regular school for arizona, government and united states government, so I ended up working as an intern in the u.s senate and also in the state senate six months and one three months in the other. Well, what I saw was pretty disgusting. A lot of lies, a lot of things that didn't make sense. Um, probably the most extreme was when the bills were coming up, that I really thought needed to be passed that I everybody just wanted to do deals they didn't care. What was on the paper that last month was just basically about you. Help me with mine I'll help you with yours and we don't care. What's on the paper, it's just a matter of doing favors, so it really messed me up inside when it came to politics. I saw dishonesty and I didn't want anything to do with it fast forward to the obama era, we'll call it that um. I was absolutely amazed at a man that would say one thing and do another. I would. I would watch a speech or two and I'd go wow. He sounds great, but there's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Here, something's, not right, and I just noticed that our country was going downhill now. I've always been in business and I know how to run a business and I think gosh. If we just run the company like a business, if we just run the country like a business, everything would be great well enter prior to 2016 donald trump of all. People wants to run that to me sounded crazy, but then, on the other side, you've got the hillary and I thought no wait a minute something's different. Something is very, very different here and through our church, I'm not going to get into any of that, but it was. It was very obvious and we realized that donald trump was chosen to do this. There was absolutely no doubt, and so I voted for the first time. I voted and I voted republican and it had nothing to do with republican democrat libertarian or anything it had to do with what was right. Who was being honest so I changed. I walked away and I've been wanting to write down my story for a long time and I haven't, and if you fast forward from 2016 to now, it's absolutely amazing what donald trump has had to put up with now think about it who but him and his personality could have put up with anything. That's been going on, all he wants to do is take care of this country and love in this country and make us prosperous make america great. That's what he's done and if it hadn't been for this covid things would have been even better but they're still good and they're going to get better. We need more for four more years and we need to support brandon and we need to make sure that these videos are not censored. Okay, that's why he said do this, that's why I'm doing it! It's 4 30 in the morning here in texas and go brandon. Thank you very much for everything you do and, yes, I walked away. You."
