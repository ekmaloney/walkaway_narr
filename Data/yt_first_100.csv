_1K_KTlorhU,hello my walk away brothers and sistersmy name is wayne fisher i live justoutside of reading pennsylvaniabeing from pennsylvania and having livedhere for over 20 yearsi was very proud to see thatpennsylvania put president trump overthe electoral college votes that heneeded to win the 2016 electionum as long as i've lived here i've neverseen this state go redso it was fantastic to see umi shared a walk away written testimonialback in august but with brandon askingfor more videos i decided i would try toput one togetheri apologize if it's a little awkwardbecause i don't usually do videosbut i wanted to put one together todayumfirst i wanted to thank brandon becausethis movement has beenfantastic i learned about it a littleover a year agobut just didn't take the time to toreally look into itbut back in august when i did i startedreading some of the testimonials fromyou guysand watching the videos and it wasamazing umi have gotten so much inspiration fromyou guys and everything that you guysput out thereum you know i was a registered democratfor years although i will say that ididn'tvote party i usually voted for thecandidate that i thought was going to dothe best jobi am middle-aged so i've been voting forquite a whilevoted for george bush i bought intothe idea of change with barack obamaand voted for him twice uh regrettablybecause at the end ofhis term i watched the economy tank iwatchedjobs leave i watched his hatred of thecountryof our police force and our freedomsbecameum attackedunder his administration so umeven through all that i truly felt theneed to walk awayshortly after trump announced hiscandidacyum i got to watch the leftshow its intolerance in forceum any questioning or disagreement withtheir um policies or proceduresor their uh goalsit was just met with bullying andintimidation andtrying to silence any other voice thatdared to think for themselves ordisagree with themso um you know it became more and moreevident thatuh the liberal progressivedemocrats hated meum you know i feel like to them i'm oneof the fiveworst things or five of the worst thingsyou can be in this country right nowyou know i'm white and i'm male firstso you know white means that i'm racisti'm privileged i'm supremacisteven though i can't change the color ofmy skin that's what i am to themuh i'm male so i'm misogynistor i am toxically masculine whateverthat meansum you know three four and five i'mheterosexual i'm christian and i'mmiddle agedso i must be homophobic orintolerant um hateful due to mygenerationmy faith and my sexual orientationthose also contribute to hatefulnessapparently andi just found out you can't say sexualpreferencebecause that is a judgmental term solearned that this past week um you knowi've been told that i'veuneducated i've been told that by peoplewho didn't know meby people who knew me even thoughand they knew my character they'vecalled me a lot of these wordsbased on our arguments just trying tosilence mebut the more they tried the more vocal ibecame in thisso um one of the things that i shared afew days ago on my facebook page wassome of the similarities and storiesthat i'd seenon this walk away page and they reallystruck meand as we're getting into the last weekand a half going toward electioni thought that it might be somethingthat's that's worth talking aboutso you know i look at a lot of storiesand a lot of people were taught thatrepublicans were for the rich and thedemocrats were for the working classand if you look now you can see howrepublicans are working forthat working class the parties aren'tthe same as what they used to be or whatthey were thought to beum a lot of people just like me votedfor obamaand did so purely because he was blackin a lot of casesand felt he could bring about someracial unity which justdidn't happen um you know a lot ofpeople hated trump in 2016and you read a lot of these stories andpeople either abstained from votingor voted for the libertarian candidatethey knew they couldn't vote for hillaryandthey like he said abstained or voted forthe libertarian candidateand these votes went to neither thedemocrats nor the republicansso it's great to see that they're comingfor trump this timeonce people were locked down from covetit's amazing to see how people startedto do their own researchand what they learned and really startedtowatch what the president was sayingversus what was being reportedand so many people who thought the ideaof fake news wasjust a talking point sawwhat the fake news is really gettingaway withthey're no longer reporting stories theyarereporting their opinions to us andtrying to get usswayed to their opinions umyou know people started recognizing thehypocrisy andyou know i started to see peoplerecognizing the hypocrisyand the political wrangling aroundthis virus umhow it became an excuse to take awaysome of our freedoms and still isin a lot of cases umit's encouraging to see that lawsuitsare already being won by businessesthat are standing up against what theirstate governments didand again a lot of cases these aredemocratic state governmentsand just the continuedmeans of trying to control us throughthisis very disheartening peoplesaw the riots and the lawlessness thatfor monthswent unaddressed by the democrats and itwas a huge eye-openerbiden and the harris administrationwouldn't evenacknowledge them until it started tohurt their poll numbersand you know this is about our citizenryand protectingthe people um you know there's so manypeople like i did that experiencedhatredand vitriol from friends upon statingtheir support forpresident trump um even people who knewlike i said even in my case that knew mefor years sothe left has adopted a strategy ofbullying and intimidationto silence the conservatives so that wewould have a fear of reprisalso it helped to create a real silentmajorityum i saw many lgbtq storieson the walk away site stating thatcoming out as a trump supporter was evenharder thancoming out as gay or umwhatever place they fall on that scalei'm sorry i know that sounded awkwardi'm sorry soum but i the one thing that reallystruck me is most peoplefeel like they didn't leave the partythe party left them andand i would agree with thatwholeheartedly so umthis election is absolutely for the soulof our countryand we need to get out there and we needtovote end mass for president trumpand we need a red wave at every level inthe senatein the house in state government we needto support our presidentit's definitely the future of ourcountryand again i thank brandon for thismovementi thank all of you for sharing yourstories i hope that minetouched somebody as well so god blesspresident trumpgod bless the usa god bless all of youyou

_cJJzsiTClg,hi I'm grace this is my walk away videoI'm walking away from the DemocraticParty because I believe they electedTrump I think they did this bymanipulating identity politics to theiradvantage without realizing that thecountry was tired of identity politicsso when Trump became president I had toknow why I hated the disgusted me I wasin shock and denial I had to know whyand I was actually curious unlike a lotof my liberal friends who did the easything and assumed that half of theUnited States is racist I thought thatwas possible but I really did want toknow why he was my president so insteadof radicalizing to the movement of he'snot my president I stepped back a littlebit because I had I was curious Istarted researching I started listeningto everything I could and all thedifferent news sources even Fox News Iknow and listening to academics onYouTube trying to figure out why thishappened and what I found was thatpeople were I would people were tired ofidentity politics I mean they were tiredof the left always talking aboutpeople's race or racism always talkingabout people's sex or sexism alwaystalking about all of the ist's and as ifit were happening everywhere all thetime it was just a buzz thing it waslike manipulating it manipulating thelatest trend to get your platformessentially because what I what Istarted to see when I actually didresearch was things don't get betterwhen the Democrats are in office it'snot like the ghettos are getting betterquite the opposite ends up being true soI started actually thinking aboutpolitics in general and I started towell I don't think ever had a gray agreatgrasp on politics I did the party lineyou know I I'm a person who loves peopleand I think people should have rights soI'll vote Democrats I mean most of usare pretty stupid and I think theDemocratic Party knows that and I thinkwith the Republican Party knows that toobut um anyway I learned a lot aboutpolitics I learned about a lot aboutgovernment in economics and and then Irealized wow I started seeing radicalradicalizing you know left's leftistsgetting violent organizing in groupsthat promote violence it's so andsuddenly I realized oh maybe I'm not onmaybe there isn't a good side and badside maybe both sides can be corrupt andyou know I'm exhausted by identitypolitics too I hate the idea that youhave to be a woman why can't I be ahuman you know I am woman but it's notlike I have to walk up to people andthat's what I expect you to see and youknow liberals expect people to see whenwhen you see someone you have to seewhat color are they what gender are theyare they gay I know I need to know Imean they might know more than I dobecause there's this hierarchy ofoppression I mean here's the Orthodoxdoctrine there's a hierarchy ofoppression I need to know where you'reat because if I'm more impressed thanyou are then what I say holds moreweight if you're more oppressed than Iam I yield to what you say as true it'sif you think about it it is ridiculouswhy can't we be human why can't we beAmericans why can't we be those thingsfirstespecially when it's related to politicsand economics and business andgovernment and so I started to see thatthat this this boogeyman all right wassmaller than people on the Left made itout to be and here's how I know becausethe second that illiberal questionsidentity politics or questionsdemocratic policy they're alrightthey're being called out right eventhough they're not and then I started torealize that all right is this hugeboogeyman that's actually way smallerlike the actual racist the actual bigotsthey are a pretty small group I thinkbecause if you don't conform to theorthodoxy you're out I lost a lot offriends Oh most of my friends at thispoint of my life I spent a coupledecades in academia and liberal circlesI mean I led the rally I led the waylet's just say that I converted morepeople to feminism you know so the pointis you question one thing and suddenlyyour friends are radio silent and you'reon the outside and they just cannotbelieve that you've turned into a thricethis horrible human beingit's like it makes you step back furtherand go what the hell is happening and itmakes you not want to participate in itbecause you recognize that as the equalopposite of the all right the when Trumpbecame president the girls started toradicalize and they're going on theextreme and turning into some kind ofcrazy out leftI mean organizing into violent groupsit's like totally unacceptable to me soI I still have liberal values but I amNOT a Democrat I might not even be aliberal I might not even be willing tocall myself a liberal anymore based onwhat I'm seeing and based on how I'mbeing treated by liberals frankly andI'm starting to see if these violentliberals get into government well firstthey're all for communism and socialismso well there goes the United States ofAmerica but second I don't want thosepeople having big government I thoughtthere might be a group of good people ifwe had big government it would be greatand maybe they'd bring in the Utopia Noyou know maybe I am a conservative maybeI don't want big government so I'mstarting to think those thoughts youknow now that I'm freed from liberalfriends who have no good argumentbecause they're not talking I can actwe start thinking about those things soI'm leaving the Democratic Party
_dNmDQ5AHis,hey guysuh my name is paulie letofsky and i havebeenfollowing brandon and walk away in facti give to himand his patreon account every month soi've been a big fan been watching allyour videosfrankly never even occurred to me to domy own i don't know why i thought mystory wasn'tum dramatic enough or whatever buthe put out a plea today to post yourvideos and iand i promised that i would so i guesshere's my uh walk awaylong time ago now i'm a walk with okaysoi i was a democrat grew up inin the liberal cesspool of americaminneapolisin the liberal family love them but iam the black sheep andthen i just thought that you knowdemocrats were nice peopleand republicans were mean i guessthat's kind of what i've been hearingall across your videos too and that'svery much my storyso as i went through my life i lived inbig cities now please forgive me but ilived in bostonand i remember going out to rally forted kennedyoh my god please forgive me but thenmichael dukakisoh it's just horrible soi live you would think by mybio that i would be a liberalgrowing up in minneapolis living incitiesi am in a creative field which generallyis liberal i'm in the publishing worldi am a single woman i've never beenmarried i don't have kidsso those are all sort of traitsfor being a liberal so no one would everguess i'm not necessarily religiousnothing like that so a half jewish halflutheransi got liberal written all over me but noi mean honestly if i would have taken atestprobably when i was six i probably wouldhave said you knowyou're a republican you're conservativebecause i've had these same values but ijustthey were misplaced so that's what i amso i had this dream my whole lifeto go walk around the world when i was12 growing up in minneapolisi read a story of a guy that when walkedaround the world and i'm like oh i wantto go do that that's how i wanted to goexplore the world but when i was 12 itwas 1974 and 12 and you just12 year old girls don't grow up and gowalk around the world so it was kind ofthishidden dream of mine and i tucked itinside my head and went on with my lifebutthat had triggered something and ialways wanted to go walk around theworldso as i moved around from the cities tothe cities and all these creative jobsthat are filled with liberalsi always had questions certainly abouttheiryou know their liberal policies but ididn't know enough ihadn't been you know woke yet but anywayin the meantime at the age of 37i just sold all my belongingsand got my world together to in fact golive this dream to go walk around theworld so that is my claim to fame i'mthe first woman to go walk around theworld umso i was walking and i started in vailcoloradoand i headed west and i wentthrough the western u.s of course fromla then i went down through new zealandup through australiaand and into southeast asia singaporeand in through malaysia and by now i'vebeen on the road for two plusyears when i walked into malaysiaand malaysia was a game changerin my life in my political world how isaw theworld and everything elsei was in malaysia during september 112001and i remember the day i rememberexactly of course where i was ii actually was staying at this somepeople were putting me up at a hoteland and this is before cell phones andall this this is 2001.so uh we had internet butit wasn't as of course as big a deal asit is now but i remember i went on tocnn they had a little internet cafe inthein the um atrium of the hotel so i gotontocnn.com that night the night well it was9 11in malaysia but it was umearly 911 in americaand i just happened to notice the timein the upper left-hand corner cnn.comthat's when cnn was actuallyreputable so uhi remember so clearly looking at all thestories and going okay well nothing of alife-changing nature has happened in theworld so i canyou know i always wanted to kind of keepup with what was going on in the worldbecause i'm heading into a very muslimworldand i looked in the upper left handcorner of cnn and it said8 45 a.m september 11thand that was new york timewell nothing of a world-changing eventhas taken place so i'll just go to bedso i go to bed i'm sleeping when all the9 11 stuff happensand because of the time difference itwas exactly 12 hours differencei wake up the next morning and all thesepeople that were coming to walk with mewithout going into all the detailthe lions clubs and rotary clubs wouldsort of pass me village to village andcome walk with me and stuff like thatso um they were all meeting me at thishoteland they they were saying well do youstill want to walk today do you knowwhat's going on and i'm likei don't know what you're talking aboutand they tried to explain to me inin their language that you know aboutthe hijackers and theycrash into the building the buildingsfall down andand i couldn't understand themso i called my dad in la right there onthe spot i said what is going on outthereby now it's 9 11 l.a timei said what is going on so he tells mewhat's going onand that set my walk and my life offinto a differenttrajectory altogether that morningso lisa do you still want to walk or doyou want toum take the day off what do you want todo and i said well let's continue towalk but if you guys could help me finda place to stay tonight that has cnnand uh internet access remember it's2001 early daysof online access they said okay so wecontinue to walkand they do they find me a place to staynow as i look back and i look back atall thisum you know when you look back and youcan seeall the the dot to dots and stuff likethat andand uh it starts to make sense or youstart to marvelat certain things i was gone for a totalof five yearswalking around the world for five yearsso how many days is that it's like 1800plus plus daysright the only night everthat i stayed with a muslim family wasthe night of 9 11.they found a family that was a muslimfamily but it was muslim by default ifyou willokay because if you marry a muslim youhave to become muslimand if if uhyou give birth to someone like uhif if you were chinese and they weremuslimnow you're both muslim and you givebirth to babies that are muslim sothis was like all by default the motherwas actually chinese and the man wasactually tamil indianbut they were muslim by default so theyyou know they had threegrown kids and and umthey had shipped them off to australiato get their educationand they said these two people theygreeted me into their homeand they said i understand you wantinternet access and cnn andjust get caught up and i said yeahthat'd be great they said i'm so sorrybut we have plans for tonightbut we'll we're gonna cut it short butwe're gonna just run outand um in the meantime we're just gonnaplunk you here in front of cnnand we'll be right back well theirmother was nextto me and she was a muslim woman withthe whole headdresseverything so her and i couldn't talk toeach other we're both sitting side bysidestaring at cnn trying to unravel whathad happened that dayand it's still 9 11 but it's 9 11 latenight malaysia timeand in the u.s now is september 12th sothey had been living with this for 24hoursdoes that make sense soum they came back and i hadit was really the start of a gamechanger in my life i sat and chattedwith them again they're muslim bydefaultright i remember so clearly sittingat their dinner tableand it now seems like a really weirdconversationbut i want you to take yourself back to2001and we didn't know what we know nowabout islam and about how they hateamericaand all this stuff so i sat at thisdinner table with them and i saidwell i don't understand how you'remuslim by default why can't you just notbe muslim because they were veryembarrassedby their religion they didn't want to bemuslim i was like well i don't get itright am i all american free to bewhoever the heck you want to bekind of you know mindset i'm like whycan't you just not be muslimand they were saying you can't do thatyou knowshe was you know born into it becauseher fatherwas muslim and married their mother andyou know all thethe whole story and then so she's muslimand wanted to marry him who's a tamilindian so now he's muslimand they're explaining that no you can'tjust not be muslim once muslimyou're always muslim and they wereworried about their kidsand their kids are grown and they'reliving in australia why are you worriedabout them they're in australiait's not they like they look muslim orlook middle eastern andremember the first day we didn't evenknow what was really going onthey said well we're worried about thembecause if they were to be asked theywould have to tell the truth about thatthey're reallymuslim so i didn't get any of this andwe just had this real blood conversationand uh he was saying that muslims don'tdrink andyou know but we're bad muslims and i'mgonna drink a beer and this kind ofthingso it was a real game changer because itgave mereally genuine insight as to what itmeans when we saywe live in a free country what does freemeanwhat is freedom of religion in americafreedom of religioni now know because of that whole episodefreedom of religionmeans you don't have to be with thereligion of your parentsyou can be born lutheran turn jewishand then get divorced and make up yourownreligion and be whoever you want to bein your friends will throw you a partyforfinding yourselfand that is really almost nowhere elsei mean there are other free countries inthe world but there's nothinglike american freedomanother big game changer in that wholemalaysianow just in case anyone asked you ittakes two months to walk upthrough the south end to the north endof malaysia so i was there for twomonths and it happened to bethrough um mid august tomid-october 2001. so right in a very biggame changingkind of timeline incertainly american history and worldhistoryso the lions clubs and the rotary clubswere helping methey were sort of you know passing mevillage to village and walking with meand etctaking really good care of me and i wasdoing it for breast cancer so there werethere's breast cancer fundraising andadvocacy work and stuff like that lotsofinterviews and press and things likethisand the lions clubs were primarily okaywell let me back up there's three majorum races if you will inin malaysia there's the muslims themalaysthe malaysians the muslims and then thechinese which are buddhistand then the indians tamil indians okayand they're hinduso there's the three major racistreligionsthere and i mean seriously i was likeforrest gump out there there werehundreds of people walking with me everyday and they were almostexclusively the chineseand the indiansand what i discoveredis that if you aremuslim then you go down to theequivalent of the dmv and you signsomething off that said yes you are apracticing muslimdoesn't care if you're chinese orwhatever if you are a practicing muslimthen you are now malaysian and thereforeyou getall these different benefits in lifemeaning you get social um you get thesocialprograms so um you would get youryour children get free education highereducationum you can own land and you can getlet's say unemployment things like thatright all you gotta do is go down to thedmv and i'm making that up because idon't know what it is but it's theequivalent of the dmv and you sign offand then you get all these thingsokay but if you don't sign off then youarenot malaysian even though of you arechinese of chinese descent for yearsokayyears decades you're still chineseyou're notvery different in america right you comeinto america you're an americanso that was one weird thing okay what ialso sawthough is these chinese and indians thatwere walking with meevery day all day they were hard workinghard working because they didn't haveany social backupthey didn't have the safety nets thatthe malays dothe muslims okay so i'm watching thisand i'm watching every town we're goingthroughby the way it's like i think it's like60to 70 percent malaysian racethat is there and then the other 30 40is made up of the otherraces and it's really that 30 to 40percentof the chinese and the indians that areworking they're the ones workingand that's what i saw i mean i saw itwith my own two eyeballsthey're the ones working so essentiallywhat i am watchingday by day foot step by foot step talkabout ground level stuffis i am seeing two societies living sideby sideone is a socialist country and one isfree market and they were side by sidewho was working who was getting educatedit was the chinese and the indians thatwere going to schooland they would raise their kids and shipthem off to say australiathe us the uk to get educated thatwas a game changer to see that twosocieties livingside by side that is malaysia and what ihaven't stayed up oni don't know i haven't stayed up on thefact that um if everyone is going toraise their kids and ship them out wellwho is in fact going to be doing thework right if the malays in fact they'renot going to be doing the work do yousee what i meanso that was a big old game changer andthat 11 happened during thistime of course and there was that funkymonth between when 9 11 happened andthen whenthe world the allies actually went towar and they went to warthe day before i actually crossed frommalaysiainto the thai border and thailand's adifferent storyso as i continued my walk i was notquite halfway around at that point so asi continued my next two and a half yearsi am watching as the world is changingand ireally started to become politicallywokei started reading papers and i meanpodcasts didn't exist yetuh it was even difficult to get anewspaper buti would try to get them and i juststarted asking questions to myself andagainyou know i didn't there wasn'tsmartphones or anything yetum but i just started asking questionsand looking and asking for answersand observing it was just a lot ofobservingtoo uh you're observing differentcultures as you're going around you knowit's likeum thailand is one kind of culture it'svery free market trade we have a goodrelationship with themthen over into india different entirelyum then up through turkey and europeand i'm just seeing all these changesand i reallybecame a republicanafter um let me see i arrived three anda half yearsafter i'd started i arrived back intothe united states on the east coastand i had a whole newuh vision and idea and understanding ofwhat america is what it means to theworld mean it means to the history ofthe world why people were fighting forfreedom what freedom really meansi got it i got it and i started to seeof course as icontinued my walklike all these people that risked livesto get to america and why it's becauseof these systems rightso they get to america and they havetheir freedom and they build and theybuild andum so then i arrive back into the u.sand i see it withfresh new eyes and i see it through theeyes of theimmigrants that came inand i just started thinking you knowit's certainly worth fighting forso once i got back into america andthere was still another year and a halfto walk from new york to coloradoum but i started listeningto um glenn beckum sean hannity i started listening torush limbaugh and i justthey made sense to me and i was likethat's it that i get itthat's where i have been frankly since iwas a kidbut i couldn't put a sort of a face toit and i was like wow i'm really arepublicanso i i finished my walk and i thinkmy mom god love her you know she'sfabulous and all butum she's liberal she's not left-wingshe's liberal she's um you can have achat with her but you know umwhen people when people ask her wasn'tit scary to have your daughter outwalking in the world by herselfum she says well the scariest thing isshe came back a republicanbut i really you know again saw theworld through different eyesand i remember when i was coming backinto the u.s and mom hadrealized i was getting so much supportall around the world and she saidi know you're going to be reallydisappointed when you get back to theu.sand you're not going to get nearly thesupport that you have all over the worldi gotta tell i was kind of nervous aboutthat boyand we could not have been more wrongi found americans to be among thefriendliest and most hospitableand most generous people of anywhere inthe worldanywhere in the world the friendliestthe most generousall the time people putting me uppicking up my check at the diner andjust you know stopping and giving megiftspeople giving you like here's some breadhere's a rockfrom the quarry and just running afterme giving me giftsand i saw that i was discovering americawith such completely different eyes andready to fightso then cut to 2016 of course and i wasthrilledi was on board with donald trump rightaway thinking you know he's abusinessmanif you are not looking with close eyesyou think he's some kind ofdoofus a big orange fella and he ain'tnodoofus i think predict this becausemark my words he is going to be a classin college in universities that peopleare going to studyhow is he 10 steps ahead of everybodyelseif you think he's stupid then you justkeep thinking thatbecause you know hehas fooled you soi am watching and studying what he doesflat out studying it because he is youyou can't be a successful real estatedeveloper in new york city andinternationally without being five stepsahead ten steps aheadso one of the biggest things i learnedon my walkfive years is that there isalways another side to the story everysingletime there is another side to the storyso as an example one time i was walkingup for two months i was walking up theeast coast of australia it's justnothing but farmland and they're hugefarms farmland farmlandfarmland and i don't remember thedetails except while i was walkingthrough this area there was a big strikegoing ontwo different sides of the strike and iwould stay with a family on one nightand they would tell meall about their side and i was like yeahyou're right i'm i'm with youhow could they and i'm all ranting raveni'm on your sidenext day i'm staying with another familythey're on the opposite side of thatstrike and they're telling me their sidei'm like yeahyou're right and i'm on your side andthen every night i would hear adifferent side to the storyand that was a game changer too there'salways a different side to the storyso now i know how to read the media asall of you do too otherwise you wouldn'tbe on thisuh great walkaway campaign so now when ihear somethingi don't believe it like automaticallydon't believe iteven if it's on our sidei dig into it what is the real story andthat's how ii listen and read and watch the newsat this point but umso i started out as a walk away but

_DYYttXTjqk,well I hadn't planned on doing mywalkaway video yet but here I am 40years later at Fort Drum outside ofWatertown New York when my NAT vanhusband and I lived here in Great BendNew York which is also outside of FortDrum I was a liberal Democrat feministand now 40 years later I'm here waitingfor Air Force One to fly over so I canfly I can raise a sign that says godbless our president and I'm a total I'mtotally on the Trump train and my lifehas has dramatically changed in the past20 years I was born into a liberalfamily and I was a Democrat up until 20or so years ago after I got married andstarted having childrenbit by bit my my views started to changeand I didn't even realize itthen in 1996 I became a born-againChristian and I began to read the Bibleand a lot of things that I had privatelythought kind of fell into placeI had a renewed relationship with myhusband our marriage improved I had arenewed love for our three children notthat I didn't love them but I just sawthem as God's precious gifts many thingschanged for me and I realized after acouple of years that I was no longer aDemocrat I changed my politicalaffiliation to Republican fast forwardto the past oh I don't know maybe fivesix seven years and I began to realizethat I was probably more leaning towardslibertarian I didn't like what I sawfrom mainstream what I'll callmainstream Republicans rhinospublican and name only I thought youknow they're just they're just the sameold same old and then President or thenDonald Trump put in his candidacy and Ithought hmmI had thought in the back of my mindthat we didn't need anymore professionalpoliticians and he fit the bill and butI was in the closet so to speak of mysupport for him for a long time and thenfinally I was at a Republican Women'sCommittee luncheon and I outed myself asa trump supporter probably the only oneat the table and I thought well that'sit no no turning back now but even Iwasn't sure you know what his chanceswere I follow I follow social mediaFacebook in particular and I began totake note of the hundreds of thousandsof likes and shares that anytime he wason for the rallies that it just got bignumbers and I thought wow maybe I'mmaybe I'm not alone we traveled toout-of-state I live in New York Stateand central New York State I don't livein Manhattan or anything like thatand we traveled my husband and Itraveled out out to I think was Indianaon business and we were staying at ourhotel and there were people there whowere Trump supporters and they weren'tashamed of itand I was like wow this is kind ofrefreshing so anyway fast forward to thenight of the election and you know everyevery report I thought oh you know he'she's not going to be able to make it Iwoke up in the morning and he had oneeye I just I could not stop grinning fordays and a lot of our friends and familywho are conservative felt the same wayit was like there's a glimmer of hopeand I've only grown to have more andmore respect for him he's not perfectabsolutely not but that's okay he's heis one of the first politicians probablysince Reagan and Ididn't vote for Reagan that is actuallykeeping his promises his campaignpromises or trying very hard to and he'sgot so many against him that are inpowerful positions so I you know I prayfor him every day I'm part of thepresidential prayer team and I encourageeverybody else to pray for him pray forour country but anyway it was a longtime coming but that this is my walkawaymoment and I'm sorry that it's kind ofjittery I'm holding this this by handoutside of Fort Drum New York and godbless everyone thank you
_lO3LLF8LKc,my name is Kelly I'm from Arkansas I amNOT a Russian bot and I have alreadysubmitted a testimonial but Brandon madeit quite clear that it was imperativethat we start submitting videos so longstory short a child of the 80s teamactually born in the 70s I think mycat's gonna join in here anyway a lot ofdiversity in the 80s and DemocraticParty seemed like the option for me whenI was old enough to vote long storyshort the day after my 18th birthday Igave birth to my daughter who wasconceived due to rape it was a verydifficult time difficult situation butthe worst part was the fact that I had alot of family from up north that clashedwith the family here in the South and Iwas constantly being hammered to have anabortion told that I was a victim thatthe child would be born with this darkcloud over its head and she would thenbecome a victim and not a productivemember of society because of this darkcloud that would continually follow herand I decided that I needed to find away to break free of being a victim andseparate myself from that victimmentality and I did that I chose not tohave the abortion my daughter is a veryproductive member of society she's awonderful wonderful motherand all-around just great person thecircumstances have not affected who shehas become one bitbut that situation I believe is whattempted me to back up and researchabortion and why it seemed to be soheavily pushed by the Democrats it'shard for me to accept that a party thatchampioned themselves is loving andaccepting of all were also championsof murder because that's what it is so Icontinue to educate myself and decidedthat the Democratic Party was no placefor me not however not however soonenough because I did vote for BillClinton and I even defended him duringthe little blue dress incidentconvincing myself that it didn't matterbecause it was private yeah that's asticky situation anyway[Music]abortion is what prompted me to lookdeeper into the Republican Party and thedeeper I dove the more I realized thatthis party was not full of hate andracismit was everything but that sure you haveyour radicals radical Christians youhave hate groups you have the KKK whitesupremacy you name it it's all out therebut it's not defined by Republican orDemocratic it's defined by hate thesepeople just hate anything that'sdifferent I'm just not that way I'maccepting and to be a Democrat meanmeant that I had to hate people thatdidn't agree with what my party stoodforso again I was confused on how thisparty was the party of love andacceptance and intolerant to everythingother than what they believed inI don't want to continue to drag this onand Riaan faceny single thing that Iwrote in my written testimony my mainpoint was to let you know that theRepublican Party is one of the

leaderhe wasn't born and raised by theKennedys and groomed from birth to bethat president that was broke straightout of a political mold from day onemaking sure that you have absolutely noskeletons in

_rgr5Zb4w-E,welli think this will be my walk away storyum it's a little bit late i know to theparty because this apparentlystarted happening soon after trump'selection buti wasn't aware of it because i wasliving kind of my own life andsilence and everything like that as muchas the silent majorityso this is it my name is john minkerand uh i grew up democraticall my life i was surrounded by my dadas a single parent being a democrat andmy momshe was also a democrat is oneso i always when i came votingflew no matter who granted i only votedthree timesyeah three times uhfor democrats my first time first yearuh that i wanted to vote i couldn'tbecause my birthday fallsjust after uh the election cycleand that was george bush's first termuh i bo obama both timesuh the first time i actually i reallyagreedand really felt good about the policieshis agenda but unfortunately as timeprogressed i realized he wasn'tfulfilling the promises he was too muchconcerned about working with peopleto fulfill any of the things that hesaid he was going to doand then his policies started changing alot of what he promotedseemed off to me but i still agreedbecause i didn't do a lot of reading ijust watchedcnn or pbs or whatever the mainstreammediataught me i was here andso i continued to listen to that for along time but i startedto do a little bit of research i startedlooking at the history of the republicanand the democratic partyi started looking into other thingswhat the policies have been in the pastwhat people have been promotingand to me all i always saw about therepublican party it wasfor the longest time was big businessrich lined pockets andgod all the time but of course i learnedthatboth sides deal with religion i'm notreligious myselfbut to me as long as religion i don'tcare if they're religious as long asreligiondoesn't control and dictate policiesand they really don'ta lot of what theydid we have all the god and thingsin our american mantra but in the endit's still not our policiesregardless istarted when blms first happened iagreed with some of the things theyhave said i thought thatexcessive police brutality needed to endbut then i looked into it more irealized thata lot of what they're touting withpolice brutalitythe people were criminals there was someexcessive force but the fact of mattersare still criminalsnot all the time there's a lot of timesthat theywere innocents and they should beprosecuted andusually they are but the problem is iswhen you start looking at statisticswhen you start looking at thingspercentages and stuffthings don't line up it's an agenda thatyou just can't goit's not any different than everybodyelseand so when you look at a lot of thehard left you realizethere's so much hatred in vitriol theypromote peacethey promote the idea of equalitybut only if it fits their narrative theyshoot down blacks that opposetheir beliefs conservative blacksthey shoot down mexicans that agree withthe wallor anything like that the reason isbecausethey don't fit their agenda theirnarrativeor you have biden saying come on manyou're not black if you don't vote formeor it just makes senseand so as i did more research i realizedthis is nonsense i believe in theequalityof everybody regardless race breeds sexor any of that nonsenseit doesn't matter we're all people ibelieve thatthis the individual is responsible forthe individualnobody should silence somebodybecause we have freedom of speech inthis countryyou may not like something that somebodysays but it doesn't matteryou have the right to say it soi realized that the left walked awayfrom me the democratic party walked awayfrom me they became too extremein their ideology silence canceledcultureyou have outlets media wanting to frameeverything the reality to theirnarrative this isn't just thecnn and everything fox news does it tooi believeevery mainstream media regardless ofwhich side of thepolitical spectrum they're on they havea biasand so you don't just read one sourceyou don't take your information frommonsters you take it from multiplesourcescome to your own conclusion after doingyour researchso i am no longera democrat i will never consider myselfa republicanbut i was never a democrat fully in thefirst place i was never republican infirst placei was a moderate i was a liberalmoderateand i still consider myselfbut as it stands right now i see noreason to vote for the democratswhen they oppose the individualwhen they impose small businesseswhen they promote extreme ideologies andallow these riots togo on i live in seattlei'm planning on movingbut when chas and chop happened andpeople got shot there wasproblems there yes it wasn't all violentlikea lot of the right media like somethingbut it wasn't peacefulit was very harmful to people that wereliving in thereand were forced to deal with no servicesfrom the cityand the city did nothing police weretold to stand downso i could no longer agree with itand i encourage everybody to read newsfrom all sources right left moderatedoesn't matterfind out as much information about asituation as possibleevery angle and come to your ownconclusionnot every black person that's killedor beaten by a cop is innocent but noris every black that is beatenand killed by a cop also guilty thatgoes for whiteshispanic or anything for cops cops arepeoplethey're humans they make mistakespeople should be punished for mistakesthat causes harm to other peoplethat goes for both sides not just copsbut regular people as wellnobody should be punished for somethingthey didn't doand nobody should be considered guiltyuntil proven innocentshould be innocent until proven guiltyunfortunately our system is against thatphilosophy anymoreand i don't know why it shouldn't be

was the party of theminorities and the people that are youknow not white that's what they say so Iwas always sympathetic to the innerstarted noticing things that werehappening against people that have anevangelical faith born again they areborn again like myself and thingsstarted developing against what webelieve in 2014 I had a dream I had arevelation in regards of Hillary Clintonthat if she won the election she wascoming after the evangelical church thatwas gonna come out through that's when Itook the decision and then I startedlooking at primaries a star rating forplatforms finally reading the platformsand all of sudden I say this under myprinciples these are not my values whatthe Democratic Party stands for is notwhat I believe in especially being aveteranso I jump on board into the GOP then inthe primaries I started in the GOPprimariesI started rooting for dogs of course butthe Garza was not really a speaker so hequickly draw out then I saw Ted Cruz howhe stood up against the liberal press inone of the debates in regard to how theyasked Hillary questions of questions howthey asked arm that the arm the GOPcandidates another one and I voted forBruce Lee the families cross

-b9zX5HJHyg,hi everyone my name is Tracy Goldsteinand I wanted to take a moment and postthe reason why I'm here I've beenfollowing this page since it came up andI've been reading your stories andbefore I began to tell you mine I wantto say that I'm very very very thankfulto read yours because they inspire meand because they remind me that there ishope in this world with that being saidif you didn't hear my last name I am aJewish woman living in America and it isreally really scary times I have walkedaway from the Democratic Party twice thefirst time was when I was in my 30s andI received my masters of Social Workfrom Washington University in st. LouisI entered that program is a bleedingliberal I was a straight Democraticvoter and I walked out of that programseeing the error of my ways I walkedaway from that program seeing theambiguity because while I am NOT on thereceiving end of oppression or thepolicies that create oppressionI saw the energy put in by the youth andthese programs that wanted to createpolicies that they actually thought werehelping people but in reality we'rekeeping them codependent on a systemthat would them I then wentabout my days as an independent and BillClinton came around and I liked him andso I started going back to my Democraticroots and then there was president ofpresident obama he did it with suchsmilehe didn't with such charisma i think heliterally could have served people aplate of feces and they would have beenhappy they would have eaten it and theywould have said thank you sirgive me more but being that i have apropensity for academia I looked at hisdomestic and foreign policyI felt that it created yet more Codependence on a system that cripplespeople and I also saw his foreign policyand the detriment that it caused to ourcountry and to our alliesI am socially a very loving warm andaccepting person I stand with mybrothers and sisters and being an allyof the lgbtqia+ movement I believe thatwhile I am personally pro-life I don'tbelieve that the government shouldlegislate a person's body but with theNew Democrats we have hate which I havebeen on the direct end of we have aculture of people who are againstbuilding walls but if you go to theirhouse they have walls all around them wehave candidates for president that aresocialists but they own seven homes andonly give three percent of theirearnings which is millions of dollars topeople in need the Democratic Party andits leadership have become hypocritesand they want to accomplish all thethingsI want with your money and my money butnot their own and so I'm walking awayagain I'm not sure where I'll end up Ireally don't know I just know it's nothere for me anymore so I hope youwelcome me as your Jewish sister in thisfight and I wish you all a great weekend[Music]
-ix_BaWPspU,I'd like to talk about why I support thewalkaway movement and I guess I have tostart by claiming I'm not a Russian butin fact this goes to a reason that I dosupport the walk away the left wants toclaim that anyone who doesn't supportevery single policy they have is evilor isn't real we're Russian BOTS becausewe don't agree with everything they sayin fact they do that to each other ifthey don't agree 100% with each otherthey're kicked out of their groupthey're ostracized and think about whatthey do to people that actually opposethem we're called fascists and Nazis andracists and anything they can make up'men to be true it isn't truein fact we've seen lately that this ismuch more projection this is much moreabout things that they believe and thatthey do themselves it's not about usit's whatever that can be done to makeus look like were monsters and then itcomes it comes to the election andpeople that supported President Trumpdid so for a number of reasons and we'reseeing him answer these these concernsof the people now we were worried aboutterrorism we were worried about oureconomy we were worried about jobs he'sfixing these things they're bettersometimes than have ever been in historyand the people that oppose us and opposehim they just will not give any creditthey still want to say thatis about racism or sexism or somethingthat morally makes us monsters so let megive you the reason or the event thatreally brought this home for me I playvideo games with a group of people andit takes six to eight to for us to be onthe same team and we've played for fiveyears or more never had a disagreementwe played together two or three timesper week we were people from all overthe country and with men women people ofdifferent jobs different backgrounds andit was always about playing the game wehad conversations that would be more ofwhat friends do even though we havenever met each other until the 2016election then with so much vitriolcoming from the media and the campaign'spolitics somehow became part of ourvideo game playing and 2 out of the 8were not Democrats we felt verydifferently about what was being saidabout us about what the real issues ofthis campaign were and we weren't vocalabout it but when the topic would comeup we wouldn't just go along witheverything we would pose a questionmaybe there was a problem with Hillaryserver and her emails or maybe thisRussia thing maybe it's got a few holesin it just simple questions like thatthey were not tolerated the next thingwe hear is that the two people thatweren't liberals or leftist will callthem we were racists we were justevery moral problem that is wrong withthe country and all of a sudden that thecountry was a a fascist Nazi regimewhere

-NS7wXmNPgo,"what's going on Facebook what's going onboys and girls everywhere around theworld hey man she got tight IQ serverDave Turner man just wanted to just givemy take I know there's a new movementthe startings called the walk awaymovement and that walk away movement isactually encouraging individualsespecially those who have been left inthe dark and left and I left behind bythe Democrat Party to move away you knowit doesn't matter if you're gonna voteto the conservative movement just walkaway from issues that don't look thatdoes not help you when it comes to yourcommunity one thing about me peoplealways ask me do I turn why did youleave the Democrat Party and you knowthey axe it was really tough decisionyou know when I was part of the DemocratParty I was actually a high rankingmember of the state party I was electedand actually was in the position itselfyou know to make some changes andactually could have really moved aheadeven easier when it comes to mypolitical standing but the thing aboutit is I started seeing policies you knowpolicies within the party that was notreally affecting what skin we're nothelping my community I started seeingthe division within the Democrat Party Istarted to see how one group ofindividuals would actually separatethemself or him another group ofindividuals but yet the otherindividuals which made up 47% which wasAfrican Americanwe're actually the ones who are beingleft behind and so I tell individualsthis you know why I decided to walk awayI didn't walk away because I was madbecause I lost an election withoutpissed off because I didn't like youknow are certain people I just didn'tlike the movement I I'm a person who ama results-driven person I mean I tellpeople this you wouldn't hire someonethen they're not doing their job ifthey're not doing their job what wouldyou do you also be fired but the thingabout it I started to see the same thingwhen it came to me is that hey thesesame policies and that insane promisesthat have been told to my community forabout 50 55 yearsI even longer than that I had honestlyreally focused and actually moved awayfrom its overall mission you know theDemocrat Party straight more leftindividuals such as African American menit's the same policy I say historic youknow we have never been us an entitythat has been liked by the Democratseven if you want to go back to slaveryyou know black men have been were usedas since bucks says the individuals whowere the ones who the breeders you knowand were ripped away from their familiesmove to you know they were able did witha hit to impregnate the black woman andthe black woman the reason why she's sostronghonest his mother's and how she's happyto take an independent role becausehonestly this has been something thatDemocrats have done for so many yearsthey've actually you know we were movedaround to plantation to plantation justto be breeders to create brand-new laborbrand-new slave labor and the thingabout it is true they continued the samething and then when after reconstructionafter the Civil War you've seen blackmen who wanted to create families and wehad more families in our communities wehad our children were going to collegeHBCUs were created we started to see theinflux of black men who wanted to befamily a family oriented but the sametime to you also started to seeing ifyou break down the black family thenhonestly and you divide the black womanagainst the black man then ultimatelyyou know someone who's gonna step up tothat role and again ultimately the blackwoman has been the one that's chosenmore because she's emotionally shefocuses strictly on a lot of socialissues but black metal more fiscallyconservative they're more conservativein their issue then they allow them ormore religious a lot of thoseindividuals itself are family-orientedbut the thing about it is too we can'tstep short end of the stick even whenyou look at child support you know theblack man knows the most likely is gonnabe the one who catches the short in thestick if you start to look at our lawenforcement you start to look at how thecriminal justice system the threestrikes laws which were created byDemocrats where individuals thatactually destroy our community eveninput and it forced us a little bitfurther away so the thing I start to payattention to is when they broke downthat system the Democrat parted so theblack woman has been the one that's beenthe upstanding and the one who honestlyhas been the one who's kept the DemocratParty afloathonestly when it comes to me and I speakto my community I'm sorry to separatemyself but ultimately the black womanwas probably will probably be the lastgroup of individuals to really leave theDemocrat Party because she's honestlybeen the beneficiary of Democrat Party Iwas give me policy excuse me and this isthe thing I tell people back in 1932 andwhen you know FDR camethey started to create the New Dealprograms and Welfare and Weller's youknow government assistance became billreally big there was two levels of thattwo levels of welfare at that timewelfare back in the day if you were asingle white man who had a wife at homeand you worked would probably be thewould be the recipients of the firstlevel of welfare and that second levelof welfare actually was basically givento a single black woman and so honestlyif you look at the welfare you signedthose paperwork's and you obviouslyrealize a black man cannot be presentand the home you they cannot be presentat the home for that black woman toreceive welfare if you start to thinksee things like WIC and other programslike that it benefits the black woman sohonestly the black woman will be thelast group of individuals that wouldleave the Democrat plantation or all theliberal plantation or would then itcomes to liberal issues when I start tosee a lot of black men today you knowlook at Democrat partisan policies todayyou know now they're pushing that wouldrather have black men locked up then andthey will let they would rather let inms-13 that tells you a lot you know andwe talk about illegal immigration thataffects black men 100% 1000% honestly itaffects the black community 1,000% thoseare gonna be the individuals who youwill see it social services who live inthose low-income housing at the sametime to the bay there'll be theindividuals who would actually workthose those service jobs and honestlythe contracting as well as theconstruction jobs for lower wages andblack men who used to do it cannot findthose jobs and so ultimately when I seeblack men today and I just tells me alittle bit about New York when I was inNew York there was a place againthey had day laborers and individualswould go to try to find jobs in theconstruction agency but there was soheavily populated and flooded by illegalimmigrants who would get paid penniesunderneath the table because ultimatelyagain they stuck together with their owngroups and black men who one of thosejobs who might have been recipients ofyou might have had a felony or had youknow a criminal past who actually wastrying to make better for them livetheir lives would try to come back outof there out of prison and make a betterlife for their child but at that timethe black woman has been empowered bythe US governmentso also me the US government has beenthe fathers to so many black childrensince the 1960's even 1932 when theystarted the first beginning the welfareprogram and some people don't realizethat black folks have been have beenvoting majority Democrat not since 1964it's been since 1932 and that's sobecause before we were majorityRepublican but then of course the GreatDepression happened and all simply FDRcame about and starts to create New Dealprograms but we were split but the thingabout the community is we continue tohave a split and we continue to have avoice before we became direct depositDemocrats and when I start to see rightnow when it comes to black men black menare being overshadowed I've seen some ofthe great leaders that you have here whomay not be liberal who are straight-upKahoot might be moderate who understandwho still have a Christian backgroundwho love God who at the same time stillhave their own views even here in mycity you know I've seen certainlawmakers who were replaced because theydid not conform to the Liberal DemocratPark policy but yet they were the mosteffective lawmakers that Democrats everhad because they were able to create abipartisan type of relationship with theother party and the Democrats theLiberals did not like that they calledthose people traitors and they made surethat they got those people out of officeand replaced him with black womenMuslims individuals who you know and nodisrespect I have no problem with theMuslim community but the thing about itis to these individuals were the bestlawmakers that they had in this citythey were the most effective lawmakersin the city but yet they got rid ofthose individuals because again they didnot conform to the new liberal socialistparty which is known as the DemocratParty again the white liberal they stilllove God and when they made their andwhen they voted they voted with theirconvictions and the thing about it istoo for black men black men thingsdifferent many people from my party Itold even people in the community thatthe black men would be the first oneswho would honestly really considerleaving the dent with the Democrat Partybecome independent or even becomeconservatives because ultimately we aremore focused on fiscal issues what's inour wallets if we're able to feed ourfamilies but the problem that you startto have is an issue where again if youwant to get rid of a black lawmaker orblack Democrat all you have to do is runa black woman against them againthe number one fans of the DemocratParty have been the black woman andagain I love my black women butultimately they have been in powerthey've been in power about the USgovernment they've been the ones whoheld this dick they've been the onesthat ultimately when the black man whomight have been incarcerated tries tocome back and they wonder why there's abig issue when it comes to recidivism wesaid it as an issue when it comes toindividuals going back into jail theymight have been the ones who may not whohave made a mistakewho might have sold drugs to buy five oftheir family or had an issue when theywere younger but when they came backthey had a felony and now they cannotget a job but then they try to come backand they say hey I want to come backhome that what black woman has alreadysigned off everything to the USgovernment and now the US government isthe new man in the house so therefore ablack man cannot come into the householdso ultimately I'm just telling you thisfor me again I'm a person who looks atfacts and I look at 50 I look I lookingfor what it is you know if you do nothold your lawmakers in your communitiesaccountable those people who excuse mewhoo-hoo honestly represent thosedistricts you're gonna continue to seewhat you see today and ultimately whenit comes to black men it's also going tobe you just like those former slaves didthey came back and they were able tocreate the family without the familystructure we're not gonna be anything inthe black community I'm a member growingup you at least had programming such asgood times they don't matter if you wasthat they let that down that y'allyou're down on your dollar and had nomoney if you were in the ghettos in thehood good times you had a man and awoman in the household you have TheCosby Show which shows middle classblack men black people middle and upperclassic success you had a programmingfamily matters it had a man and a wifein the household you had programs againthat honestly reflected a positivehousehold where they came to the blackcommunity but the problem is now thethings that we look at and how thoughthe Liberals have already turned us isnow love and hip-hop and being a babyit's very very one is more importantthan creating a family and the blackwomen have gotten to a point now thathey I don't need a man I don't need aman for nothingbut ultimately it's sure because the USgovernment is ultimately replace you andagain with you looking right now thislook at the last democratic you knowchairman election there was a black manwho ran okaysacré Ellison although I'm not a fan ofEllisonhis entire black caucus who had he hadbeen a member for four years votedagainst him becoming the chair of theDemocrat Party but the Democrats saidhey we already give you a black chairwe're giving you two you know you knowwe already had one of those we don'tneed those anymore and then they lookedat the numbers at the last election whenabout eighty eight percent less than the95 percent that voted for Barack Obamayou know started to voted for a and eventhirteen percent of black men voted fora trump you know you started to see heywe don't need you anymoreso they put Perez in they put inHispanic in the first Hispanic chairmanof the Democratic Party and it's for areason it's for design it's not becauseultimately he was the most qualifiedbecause honestly he's an imbecile forwhat I see but the thing about it isthey did it because ultimately they wantto pull out a new group of people toreplace you and that's gonna be theillegals and Hispanics if the Democratsput as much time in our communities thetop ten with the highest crime rates inAmerica which are run by Democrats everyslum in America come on listen to thisevery slum and guilt in America is runby Democrat so how does that help youout they say they're fighting for youwell honestly you must not be fightingso hard and if you can't fight hardenough for us and change the trajectoryof this community then we need to getsomebody else in place but the problemis you have people like Maxine Watersand people like cleaver and people arelike who else Jesse Jackson al Sharptonall these people who call themselvesJews who are ultra bleep black pawns andeven when it came to their last electionwhen you hadHilary Clinton going through issues whenDonald Trump made the the the the thestatement what difference do you does itmake Hillary Clinton called and marchedout the whole and I our black caucus tomake a statement against Donald Trumpand ultimately if you look at it rightnow the leadership that you have rightnow and so in it because they get theirmarching orders from those above soultimately black men I'm making theappeal to you and you start to see thisas I'm so happy to see so many black menwho are stepping up to the plate and arebeing free thinkers who are not afraidto say hey this is not working for mycommunity this party has lied to us forso many years they've act like they'reyour friends but liberal policyultimately is doing nothing to upliftthe black community we're not followingHollywood when you start to look at thepolicies of the President opening upfactories it's not just white peoplethat work in those factories it'sindividuals at black people work inthose factoriesblack men have been the main group ofindividuals who tried to make a try toget back and they living for theirfamilies but the problem is is once youhave a felony on your record it's hardfor you to really get a good-paying joband then you try to get into the serviceindustry but yet you've been replaced bythe same illegals that the Democrats arepushing today open borders again I tellyou this is all about a plan a biggerplan this plan has been enacted foryears they are wanting to create a brandnew voting bloc a new group of directdeposit Democrats because they start torealize that not only a populationdecreasing but ultimately we're startingto wake up and not giving them that boatthat they want 24/7 have you everwondered why they don't ever come intoyour communities only only come aroundduring the presidential elections theydon't really educate you on what theseoffices do and they really don't comearound when it comes to those localelections this is the thing there is aagenda out there when they look at thepublic schools public schools arefailing I'm here in CharlotteMecklenburg when you have about 60% ofthe school board that has black facesbut yet you still have segregatedlow-performing schools what it what whyare you there because ultimately theyget their marching orders from someonehigher these are the ones that wouldexactly what's put in place for them tomove ahead and stay in their positionultimately it's not a class strugglewithin our communities you know see meit's not a black and white it's a classstruggle in our communities is those whoare up at the top who might like metrying to keep those like me at thebottom again that's the reason why Iwalked away and I'm gonna tell you thisright now honest another reason why Iwalked away is because once the DemocratParty elected a person who has whitesupremacist background I'm gonna keeptelling you this over and over againthey talk about this so-called switchthere was never a switch ultimately onething I've noticed about you knowindividuals in this community isdifferent about this before they vote aparty and ultimately ultimately i'matell you this right now those sameDemocrats you got to realize slavemasters interact with slaves they knewhow to control those slaves they had noproblem being around the slaves soultimately when it comes to today it'sthe same thing you haven't been free youare still underneath their party youvote the same way robert e lee d roberte lee when he walked walked in thevoting booth he walked and calledhimself a proud Democrat and you want torename a school because his name afterrobert e lee or you want to take out ourstatue because it's named after robert elee but yet when you go to the votingbooth you vote the same way roberte-media huh again it goes back to theignorance of our community if yourealize two of our schools they don'ttalk about civics they don't talk abouteven when it comes to your true historythat past slavery you do have a historyand i'm when it looks to education andwe also look at the lack of upwardmobility in some of these communitieseven here in my city charlotte it'sbetter off you coming from somewhereelse than may you for be from a personwho's from here to even move up becauseultimately they got you in a trapand I'll tell you this black manthey've been the main one locking you upthey've been the main one pushing thesepolicies and I tell them this if thatwas so and even when it comes to ourformer president if he was so worriedabout the black community when you hadboth houses of Congress why didn't youget rid of three stripes the thing aboutit is two is ultimately theseindividuals make money people likeHillary Clinton opened up more prisonsthan you in NY state than any othersenator the prison-industrial prisonchronic complex has been run if yourealize when it comes to public schoolsthey build prisons at their with inthird grade off of test scores and theymove kids around even with the lastadministration the education systemdropped four points and people don'trealize that black people it's not foryou honestly I want you to wake up and Iacts you ask yourself this question whyare you a Democrat is it because theysay you're black but also why are you aDemocrat ask yourself that question whathave they done for you lately and whenit comes to that point you after youreally ought to sit back and look aroundyou'll realize honestly you're not evena thought because ultimately they have abigger plan the liberal agenda againlike Malcolm X said and I'm sorry tomake it so hard he said but blackmanaged vote Democrat that you aredisgrace to your race because ultimatelythe white liberal cares nothing aboutyou again it's the slave masters theyknow how to control you they've beenaround you they are the ones whohonestly you know push the Willie Lynchyou know model to you they're the onewho used you to talk out against anotherone and others another slave who wassmart and intelligentwe brought an idea he always used theother ones to go against him becauseultimately that was his lifeline thatwas safety that was their safety net andthey didn't want anything to disruptthat why are you what is your liver whatwhy do you have a loyalty to a partywhich ultimatelyhas nothing done nothing coming in justlook around look at our schools we don'tfocus on education no more look at ourfamilies there's no any women in thehouseholds anymore let's really payattention to our prison in New York Citythere are more black men in prison thanthere are black men with college degreesif you realize again wake up and whenyou wake up be like me it's okay nomatter what they say it's okay to walkaway y'all be blessed Lee everybodythank you for joining this broadcast agod bless americawake up now it's time it really is timematter of fact it's been - y'all beblessed peace"
-qyZy-09Fac,hello i'm tinai'm 49 years old i've been a democratsince i was18. did not vote forobama or hillary did not like either oneof themand the reason why i walked away wasseeing how the democratic party has beenback in the blm as i call burn lootmurder um i don't agree with thatmy mom always taught me raisin you knowthat if you broke somethingof somebody else's you replaced it ifyou broke your own thing if you wanted anew one you paid for it yourselfi see uh pelosiwant money from the governmentto fix these democratic towns that havebeen burning up in it becausethey've allowed it to happen but umyeah yeah when i wasa democrat nobody ever called me racistor anything to that extenti have a family with multiple differentraces in themi'm firefront races but since i left thedemocratic partythat's all i'm called anymore and itjust shows methat it's not the republicans whoare racist like they're callingpresident trumpbut the fact that is it's the democratswho'sactually the racist ones and if youdon't agree with themthen you're racist so yeahnobody turned me away from thedemocratic party but the democraticpartyyes as my dog wants some attention soall right you guys have a good onestop nico stop
-XoWP6r2cB0,okay so I've never had to walk awaybecause I've never been a Democrat but Isaw this movement and I really wanted toadd my input um you know growing up Inever I never was associated with eitherparty my parents you know my parentswere never you know Democrat they werenever Republican they always were kindof just like in the middle theirindependence and that's how I was raisedjust to be an independent thinker andyou know my beliefs don't perfectlyaligned with Republicans nor did theyever perfectly aligned with Democrats soI've always kind of been more centeredbut up in the past couple yearsespecially I find that I've reallyreally even though I'm still centeredand I'm slightly conservative I amcompletely anti left and that doesn'tmean I disagree with or I hate everybodythat is on the left but I hate what theleft has become and what it stands forfor example the first time that I reallyreally started getting red flags goingup was probably in between the time ofObama's second term and whenever Trumpwas against Hillary and in between thattime I you know I started getting redflags like wow you know the left isreally really pushing it because youknow I'm okay everybody has differentopinions everybody's allowed to thinkdifferently and that's okay that's youknow that's the beauty of America we allhave different opinions where theproblem starts is whenever you startbelieving that your way is the onlyright way and anybody that disagreeswith you is a Nazi is you knowanti-woman is anti LGBT is you knowhateful is racist that's where you knowyou I draw the line you know and and thebig big moment for me that I really eventhough like I said I've been anindependent forever the big moment forme that I really was like I will neverever want to associate myself with theleft is Donald Trump being elected and Ithink it was because you know the wholetime that he was up againHilary as you all know the media waspainting a different picture than whatwas actually happening all of thesepolls that they were showing that wasgoing on during pre-election was showingthere's no chance Donald Trump could winHillary's gonna be the next presidentand it just was like always in your facealways in your faceHillary's gonna win liberals Democratseverything was anti Donald Trump andthen he won and all of my friends on myFacebook and even some of my familymembers instantly became hateful purehateful I had people wish that theywould see America fail just so theydidn't have to see Donald Trump succeedwhich is like the most unamerican thingthat you could possibly do but I meanI've had family cut me off people thatyou know they they completely anybodythat I'm associated with that is on theleft are some of the most judgmentalpeople I have ever met in my life andthey want to tell you that you'rehateful that you're all of theseterrible things and I think that'sthat's why Brandon's video really stuckwith me is because I related even thoughI'm not you know I'm not a minority asfar as you know I'm obviously a whitefemale I mean that even though Democratswouldn't tell me because I'm a femaleI'm automatically set back in lifebecause I'm not a man I'm not you knowI'm not a minority but I've experiencedfirsthand you know people you know tellme oh you have to be heartless you haveto be this you have to be that because Ididn't agree with democratic ideologiesand I'm not I'm not at all but likethat's that's where it really hit homefor me is you know my problem is youknow the DemocratsI appreciate that everybody's entitledto their own thoughts to their ownopinions but the moment you starttelling people that they are bad peoplethat there's something intrinsicallywrong with them as human beings becausetheir their views don't align with yourparty views then your party shouldn'texist it's wrong it's wrong if that'ssocialism in the making and you know Iwant nothing to do with that so you knowI a hundred percent walk Isupport walk away and you know I reallyreally hope to see other people speakingout because my facebook it's likeeverybody is so brave to be liberaleverybody is so brave to bash DonaldTrump everybody is so brave to blameevery white person in this world foreverything and it's just it's not rightanymore and I'm sick of havingconservative friends who are afraid tospeak up and afraid to say you guys thisis wrong you're not you're not rightabout everythingum I have friends that are afraid tospeak up because of the hate that theyget because liberals are so bold youknow to criticize everybody else so youknow speak up don't be afraid to walkaway don't be afraid to stand up forwhat you believe in and more thananything walking away I think it needsto be pointed out that just because youwalk away from the left does not meanthat you have to become a Republican itdoesn't mean that you have to even befully conservative it just means thatyou're fed up with the crap from theleft you're fed up with you know themsaying that they're right they're theonly right answer they know everythingyou know it's it's the party of Liesit's the party of deception and nobodyshould want a part of it nobody shouldwant to be part of the party thatvictimizes you all of the time thattells you no matter what you won'tsucceed and wants to blame every everywhite person in the world for every racerelation issue because it's just nottrue the facts are not true and morethan once I've presented facts to peoplein an argument any kind of liberalargument any kind of democratic argumentand they can't argue facts so you knowjust to walk away from the left does notmean that you have to go right you canstay sinner be an independent thinkerand honestly that I believe is thefuture of the country I don't think thatthe future is Republicans and DemocratsI think the future is gonna be goodbyetwo-party system everybody is gonna havea brain of their own and they're gonnathink with the brain of their own and asa millennial I have hope for mygeneration that we're gonna do away withthe two-party system because it's timethatgoes but hands down walk away from theleft they're toxic they run onnegativity they run on you know the factthat they believe that they want or theywant you to believe that you cannotsucceed as a woman as a gay man as a gaywoman as a trans you cannot succeed youcan as a black person as an immigrantanybody that's not white pretty muchthat you cannot succeed in this countryor in this life without them to speakfor you and I believe that every personin this world I don't care who you are Idon't care your genderI don't care your sexual orientation Idon't care any of that I believe that ifyou want something in life if you fightfor it you will get it and you don'thave to do it in a

0_zyyP971tE,"hi my name is Donna and this is my walkaway video and I think I'm really moreof a walk with but I'll tell you when Iwalked away first I want to say Brandonyou're amazing and I pray for you and Ithank God for you and I so admire yourcourage and the the the fight thatyou're in is so vital to the survival ofthis nation so I just come into and Iwant to come into everybody who's hadthe courage to make a walk away videoand the other day I was watching themagain cuz whenever I start to get downand I stumble upon the nonsense theabsolute disinformation and propagandathat I see on Facebook and I start toget discouraged and lose hope I'll haveto go and watch them walk away videosI'm like okay not everybody has losttheir mind there are there is still somepeople paying attention and so youreally encourage me and motivate me andkeep me going and it finally occurred tome you know Donna the only reason youhaven't made a walkaway video is becauseyou're a coward and you've got 5,000Facebook friends and you don't want tolose them because I kind of make myliving online and I thought point that'sreally shallow so I'm gonna do my walkaway video my story is that I was raisedin an Irish Catholic Democratic familyand that's like all one-word IrishCatholic Democrat we my dad was a truckdriver my dad my my brothers my unclesall of my male relatives they were allunion workers a lot of them werecarpenters truck drivers so if you wereUnion a you were Democrat if you wereUnionyou were Democrat I remember in ourhallway growing up we had a crucifix andthen on either side we had Jesus andJohn F Kennedy and both of them werebedecked with palm fronds from PalmFridayI mean Palm Sunday because in in ourworld they were pretty much on par youknow you had Jesus and you have Jonathanso we were the original identitypolitics people we were so excited thatsomeone like us an Irish Catholic madeit to the presidency so I understood whythe african-american community was soexcited about Obama does it Wow someonein the White House who is like us and Itook we I totally get itwe were identity politics before therewas a term for it and so that was kindof my world and I'm I'm almost 60 so Iremember Jimmy CarterI remember the malaise I remember thehopelessness it was like the air webreathed was despair and if you everwant to get a sense of it there's afantastic movie it's called invinciblewith mark world wall birth and it's atrue story about a bartender in SouthPhilly who tries out for thePhiladelphia Eagles and spoiler alertyeah he makes the team they wouldn'thave made a movie if he didn't butanyway it's set in that time period whenCarter was in power and you just sensethe abject despair in the country andthat's what I grew up with with aDemocrat in power the other movie thatyou can watch to really get a sense ofwhat it was is is miracle about the 1980hockey team because you know it's setthan all the training in the backgroundis the 1970s but anyway be that as itmay just complete hopelessness but wewere all Democrats and then RonaldReagan came along and I can rememberwatching his speech at the RepublicanNational Convention and I was spellboundabsolutely spellbound and I think atthat moment I walked away and I watchedone man restore nation thetransformation in the mindset and thatthat's really what it is it's a mindsetwas just phenomenal and now of courseI'm a mother and I have two children andI've lived through at least sixten years of completely failedpresidencies I mean W it was a completeand abject failure as a president allthe wars and and madness and nonsenseand then eight years of Obama completelyfailed presidency so sixteen years andmy my kids are twenty eight twenty twoand I thought you know they're nevergoing to see a successful president sayand then Trump came along and just Ithink he's gonna tear it up but theopposition against him is just so soincredible but anyway what I wanted tosay is when I made the decision tobecome a Republican and I walked awayback in 1980 there was so much flak inmy family I mean I just could notbelieve that I was doing this but thefunniest thing is now I'll go to like onFacebook I'll go to like Breitbart orFox News or the president's page andI'll see my family members thumbs-upthing yeah they've all walked away theyI'm not all that I don't know if all ofthem but a lot of them have and I'mamazed like Union guys truck driversthey're walking away too so that's kindof my walk away story I just want to sayone more thing on on a personal notewhat really really infuriates me is howlightly people throw away the termracism as a way to shut someone up and Ijust want to give a really a personalstory and then what I know from thefrontline my daughter who's now 22 isthe most like solid stable onion moatshe's not emotional she plays thingskind of close to the vest just a realsteady steady young lady I mean she wasworking at a gym in the nursery you knowpeople are working out she's watchingtheir kids and I get a call from her andshe was absolutely hysterical I havenever heard her that hysterical in myentire life and she just said momsomething happen at work please pray formeI thought she'd been raped that's howhysterical she was and I she came homeand I'm like I myself I'm like whathappenedsaid mom there was a couple and theyaccused me of being a racist they wentto my boss and they said that I I didn'tpay enough attention to their you knowto their african-american child that Iwas paying to the other children justlike I love all the children equally Iliterally had been holding him half thetime and it just set him down and theysaid that I was a racist she saidthere's a worst thing anyone has eversaid in my entire life and to this dayshe will tell you the worst thing thatanyone has ever done to her was accusingher of being a racist and I think mostpeople feel that way like she's like howhow can I take my heart out and showthem that it's not in thereshe's crushed and and the duck has Olearmanner that people throw around thatword just to shot each other up isdespicable to me I can't even put it ininto words and again I'm old enough sheI have seen some some really bad timesin this countryand I think anyone with a with a pulseand a drop of integrity and conscienceknows that this country's had a bigproblem with it there really was ahistory of great evil in slavery and tobe thrown in with with that level ofevil so cavalierlyI just Wow it's incredible and I find itinfuriating and I that's why I'm reallyexcited to see the diversity in thismovement I think it's really importantand then the last thing that I want tosay and is that I work with Hispanic I'mnot Hispanic I'm as I told you I'm Irishbut I work for Hispanic InternationalMinistries and it's based in BogotaColombia so most of my work is inColombia but I work all over for 15years I've worked all over CentralAmerica and Latin America CentralAmerica and South America and I was justin Guatemala and I literally followedthe path from the border of Hondurasstraight through Guatemalato Mexico and that was with I work withnonprofits and I work with churches andpastors and we followed the exact pathand I was with a pastor and I said sotell me about this I mean I know what itis since who tell me firsthand firsthandyou were right in the path of this whatwas this Caravan all about he said Donnathese are the most vile violent viciousevil people you can imagine they left atrail of wreckage in their wakerobberies rapes massive destruction hesaid what they do is they get the womenand the children then they use them asprops and I was working specificallywith an NGO that does a lot of rescuework child rescue work it's anincredible organization in fact I'mgoing back to Guatemala with them in acouple months if you want to come withme let me know and I was talking to oneof the rescuers and I said so howserious is is the sex trafficking ofyoung women he said non-existent I'mlike what you said yeah no young womenhere are perfectly safe all of thetrafficking now is children so when theysay hey all you need to get across theborder free to these evil eviltraffickers all you need is a child intow do you know what they do they createa market for children and so now all thechildren are being not all the childrenbut thousands and thousands and tens ofthousands of children in Central Americaespecially but Latin America around theworld they're being kidnapped they'rebeing bought they're being sold they'rebeing sexually exploited because they'rea free ticket you want to know why 600children have not been picked up bytheir parents at the detention centersbecause they were parted from theirparents so long before that journeybegan and you know to have some I havepeople on Facebook this one guy justlast week called me we ready racist Imean I go I'm like I went that do youspeakbanished because I'm pretty fluent and Ispent a lot of my time last year threemonths in Costa Rica a month in Braziltwo weeks in Guatemala I spent a lot oftime in Latin America and so I can tellyou firsthand firsthand that people whospeak Spanish are more than capable ofcoming to a proper point of entry andpresenting the documentation and it'sactually racist to imply that they can'tbecause they absolutely again the peoplesneaking through beware because they'revery very dangerous and so I think againto see this movement to see blacks it tosee now I guess it's LexA the the Latinoaccent it just really gives me hope andI wanted to go ahead and put my face outthere and say I believe in what you'redoing Brandon I I want to come into allof you and this ended up being longerthan I thought it would but I'm so happyto see many other people walking away Iwalked away decades ago and I've neverlooked backno regrets god bless all of you[Music]"

0h__rw_tkrA,hello my name is Dan Chavez I am aresident of the city of Oxnard inCalifornia Southern California to beexactlocated in Ventura County one of thethings that I wanted to take thisopportunity and pretty much share mystory of the walk away back in 2016 Iwalked away growing up I was alwayspretty much taught that the DemocratParty is for the minorities and the poorwell I am one the oldest of four boysand came from a single-parent householdmy mother working two three minimum-wagejobs and my brothers and I we still sawher struggling I remember seeing herface so many times when she would walkout from you know government assistancebuildings to try to get support to helpyou know buy food or whatever and themtelling her all the timeyou made too much yet if she tried to goget a car or a house she didn't makeenough again it was always taught to methat you had to be rich and white to beRepublican and minorities and those thatwere poor or Democrats and I believethat so much because in school it wasimplanted into so much so when I turned18 I registered as a Democrat I followedthe Democrat rules to always vote for aDemocrat and even if the person wasn'tthe best choice that's who I still votedfor it wasn't until 2016 in my communitywhen I ran for City Council that I metcandidates that were running fordifferent offices throughout the stateof California and there was a couple ofthem that I met that were Republican andI was really impressed by how theywanted to make a change in the communitywas the exact same change that I wantedto make when I ran for City Council Iran on a very simple promise to theresidents protect our families ourcommunity and our futuresimple as that so in 2016 I met theseamazing candidates started to learn moreabout the Republican Party and where itall started and and what it stood forand in December of 2016 I registered asa Republican not because of who thepresident was was because a simplesimply that what the Republican Partyrepresented was something that Ibelieved in I believed in public safetyI believe in working hard to get thingsin life I believe and not depending onanybody what the Democrat Party does isthe opposite of that I couldn't supporta party any longer that wanted to enablepeople or allow criminals to run wild inthe state of California it's sad thatthere are so many laws that gives morerights more protections to

0KmmY1Go__c,okay I had to make a video about thisbecause everybody is still upset aboutthe election and people keep asking mewho did I vote for well I'm a Republicanand I don't tow the party line oneverything but I tell you point blankand playing I am not afraid to admit orshare with the world that I was proud tovote for Donald J Trump and I'm gonnatell you why man because I am so sickand tired of the same old politicianspromising the same thing every four toeight years this same cycle and guesswhat nothing nothing changes nothingthey get comfortable with the power toget comfortable with a position and theyget a nice effect on the success of notdoing a damn thing now before y'all getbutthurt about this I was also veryadamant and proud of voting for BarackObama in 2008 and 2012 and that is not aslight against John McCain you know hehe served our country and he was a PLWand to me he is still an American Herookay but you can't fight history andObama is gonna be President period thecountry moved to the left okay they gotupset with Bush and I don't agree witheverything Bush did and also I mean Idisagree with a lot of things thatPresident Bush did and the country spokeand this is a democracy ladies andgentlemen and when President Obama blewJohn McCain out there was no riots therewas no property being destroyed yes itwas some words being tossed back andforth on both sides and to me that shameon both sides but that's how democracyworks somebody's gonna win andsomebody's gonna lose but to the victorgoes the spoils and you are responsiblefor the direction of this country forthe next four years that's the cycle andthen if you don't do a good job you getbooted out of here that's how democracyworks and it's 2012 when Mitt Romney ranagainst Barack Obama Barack Obama wonthe country went left in its state leftand it did not like Mitt Romney'spolicies or how he presented himselfeverybody had their own reason or why hedid not like Mitt Romney and Mitt Romneyis not an evil person he's not he justplayed in the game of politics and helost it is what it isnow fast-forward to one of the singlemost unique elections in history you gota man who had absolutely no politicalexperience against the woman who has had30 years of political experience nowsometimes experience can be a very verygood thing because it shows wisdom andbeing trialed through fire you gothrough things and you build thatleadership that character comes andyou're able to help people and you'reable to move the country forward fromyour experience also experience can be avery bad thing because if you've beendoing something long enough and notenough people have seen any kind ofpositive movement or any kind ofpositive improvement even though you'vebeen getting millions and millions ofdollars something's wrong now this isn'tsets ISM this isn't racism because bothcandidates were white both you knowwhite well he's orange but you got awhite man and you got a white woman oneis 69 years old one is 70 years old soraysysm was not an issue no other racistcomments from supporters on both sidesbeing tossed around like bad wordtenantsyeah it's shameful and all of you shouldbe ashamed of yourselves and it's wrongwhether you're on the left or on therightbigotry prejudice racism sexism feminismall the isms is wrong period and you donot represent me and you do notrepresent the majority of the country ofpeople that honestly just want thecountry to go in a different directionand feel that maybe Hillary just was notthe answer now there will be a womanpresident I honestly believe there willbe a woman president within the nextsixteen to twenty years it goes byreally really quickly there will be butthat first woman president is gonna havethe respect of the majority of thecountry and that is how democracy worksand people want to get rid of theelectoral college well you know some ofthe electoral college was invented tokeep mob ruled from ruling the countrynow if you don't understand that go andtake your civics classes in college oryou got some in high school on theimportance of the electoral college andfirm balanced representation of theentire country you'll be fascinated bywhat you learn in those classes andabout how the country really works andabout how the democratic process ofvoting in a president works so foreverybody that's upset because you can'tget lost well guess what before the endof your lifetime nine times out of tenmore and more of your candidates aregoing to lose and more and more of yourcandidates before your lifetime aregoing to win now you win with grace youyou don't have to hold the losers handsbecause the victor to the victor go thespoilsbut two people that lose the best thingyou could possibly doinstead of burn and stuff down insteadof destroying your communities or thecommunities of others as your bust inbuild not only build but build a massivecoalition and convince people throughevidence and facts of why your point ofview is superior then your opponent'spoint of view and why your direction ofthe country is better than the otherthat's how democracy works to say thatDonald Trump is going to destroy Americawhile you're destroying America is anoxymoron it's hypocritical I know you'reangry I know you're hurt but if I wasmad at you and you pissed me offand I said you know something I want tobreak the law and I want to come to yourhouse and I want to tear up your stuffbecause I'm mad at what you said youwould say why G night storm you need toget control of your emotions brother andthis is irresponsible behavior and howin the world you you think you canconvince me of the words that you arespeaking because your actions arescreaming louder than any words thatever come out of your mouth you aredestroying my country you're destroyingmy home you're destroying my job or howI'm able to take care of people and myfamily and my children if you want toconvince me didn't convince me show methrough your policies through youractions then listen to your words so onthat note I want to say God bless thiscountry and I wish Donald Trump the verybest for the job that he has becauseit's never done this before he'sneed a lot of help but it is our duty asAmericans to pull behind a presidentregardless if it's a Democrat or if it'sa Republican respect the office and Iknow so many so many liberals say wellObama was not respected in thepresidential office and he wasn't it isthe truth and it is shameful and I willsay this one more timebigots on both sides whether you have aare in front of your name or D in frontof your name if you cannot respect theoffice of the president then you have nobusiness voting for president and youhave no business running for presidentso period you can agree to disagreeagree to disagree but by the end of theday when Donald Trump is in that WhiteHouse and President Obama was sittingnext to him both men put aside all theBS and the rhetoric of the campaign andput the country first both men hadnothing but respect for each other anddynatrap had respect for President Obamaand President Obama had respect forpresident elect Donald Trump becausethat's democracy that that's how you getthe job done that is what America isaboutwe will fight but we will respect eachother move forward and get on with thebusiness of governing our great countryso god bless you god bless Republicansgod bless Democratsgod bless liberals god blessconservatives god bless independence andgod bless everybody that hears my voiceI love you you're my brothers and you'remy sisters let's make this country greatbecause the president regardless of whoit is does not make the country great itis meand it is you that makes this countrygreatso halogen later and I look forward toreading the comments on this video godbless you all bye

1fFllyGSvK0,"hi just gonna give you a little bit ofan update my name is Debbie and I am 53years old and this is my walk away videofor most of my life I was a registeredindependent but I voted Democrat formany years I voted for Bill Clintontwice I voted for Obama twice and I hada brother who kept telling me why do youkeep voting the way you are and my thingwas because I'm a lesbian and theDemocrats are looking out for me not theRepublicans well second term with Obamaand I start to see things that didn'tmake a lot of sense I saw that thingsare being this world was gettingracially charged I saw what was going onin Chicago thinking why is it so badthere and then the whole thing theAffordable Care Act my insurance wentfrom great insurance that I didn't paythat much for but my deductible was verylow my prescriptions were very lowalmost a year after the Affordable CareAct gets jammed in in through anexecutive order the next time I had torenew my insurancethe premiums went up co-pays went up theminimums went up the deductibles so whatI may have had a $1,000 deductiblenow it's 3000 her family plan it's 6500who can afford that I went a couple ofyears without having insurance and I gotfined from the state that I'm in for nothaving insurance then I got hit againfor federally for not having insuranceand those two fines together were lessthan what I was paying for insurance soit's the lesser of two evils now we cantalk about the elections that werecoming up with Hillary versus Trump whenTrump first got into the ring I kind oflaughed going he's never gonna goanywhere this is kind of funny and as hestarts taking out one Republican afteranother and after another and afteranotherso he's found the nominee I'm like whoaI need to check into a few things I wentback looking up all sorts of videos fromhimI think that he was saying way back whenhe's on shell Donahue about thedirection that this country was goingbefore he even thought about running orbeing in politics everything that hesaid then is what he's saying now thereare so many other videos that are outthere of things that he said way beforeeven being in the political spotlightpeople really should check that out thenI start doing a lot of checking intoHillary Clintonand finding out how dirty she was howdirty the Clintons are then looked intomore things about the DemocraticNational Committee the things that theypulled the fact that the Democrats arethe ones have been holding us down forever they want us poor they want peopleof color to abort did children they arethe ones that are racist and the more Ilook into it the more I see how racistthey actually are I have not seen orheard anything come out of presidentTrump's mouth about rates I've neverheard him say anything disparaging Leeabout homosexuals he has it and it'scrazyI get so irritated watching themainstream media with him lying over andover and over one of the biggest thingsthat I witness washe's an augur Inauguration saying thatnobody was therewell they manipulated the folder thephotos to look like there was nobodythere but it was when it first startedwhen people started just going in theother thing that I've seen is that yourTrump says something if they don't putup the whole thing it'll just take alittle bit to get a sound bite to makehim look like he's racist homophobic andthen I'll go back and watch the wholevideo and see that's not what he wassayingso I talked to a few people and startedquestioning things and I had peoplesaying oh my god are you gonna supportDonald Trump are you crazy I had peoplecalling me out telling me they wouldnever talk to me again on Facebook I hadI was in different groups that peoplestarted throwing me out of groupstelling me that it couldn't be in thesegroups any more because I would notsupport Hillary Clinton well HillaryClinton was gonna be a terriblepresident and she was part of this ifthey want to call it New World Order ofjust taking over everything and takingour rights from us and I just I justcouldn't and now I find myself yes and Idid I did vote for Donald Trump and Iwill vote for Donald Trump again becauseI totally totally agree with protectingour borders having a wall giving usdifferent health care optionsderegulating a lot of things that he'sdone to help us well right now thenumber one supplier of oil and gas theUnited States is making money we're backin that world stage of being up therehe's not apologizing to anybody this ishow it is America's first and that's itand I know I'm going on a tangent herebut there's just so many things I get sofrustrated watching and listening topeople just saying that he is a racistwell how is he a racist show me thathe's a racist I haven't seen it showedthat he is anti-semitic he is not hisdaughterhe's married to a Jewish man sheconverted to Judaism she her children aJewish this is just more hate-filledlies that the left is doing it it tookme not a long time to find out all thestuff that the left was lying about andI ended up walking away when I went tothe voting booth and voted for DonaldTrump I will never ever ever againvote for Democrat they're not lookingout for us they're

1grrLAyZ0Wo,"hi everybody I wanted to make a videobecause I got this in the mail todaymm-hmm I have never ordered a shirt or abumper sticker or anything for any typeof movement in my life not a politicalone nothing but I felt really inspiredby this movement and I wanted to show mysupport because it's I want people toask me because I feel emboldened andempowered now to state my opinion and aslong as you stay calm and respectfulthat I think that that can give us along ways and so I made a video backlike June 21st I think it was and I gota lot of support never done a video myentire life for anything I don't knowwhat came over me but you know it wasonly a 3,000 people in the group at thattime and now there's 163 which iswonderful awesome and if you guys didn'tsee that videoformer Bernie supporter lifelong liberalecho-chamber sjw the whole thing andcame to the conclusion that I was wrongabout about a lot of things and myassumptions I challenged myself andheard outside voices ben shapiro stevencrowder Dave Rubin the Joe Rogan podcastI have sort of a boring job so I get tolisten to podcasts all the time you knowthat long-form conversations are soimportant and I think a lot of us havecome from the same place the people thatare walking away from the left had neverbeen privy to that type of informationbecause it was just you know MSNBC CNNNew York Times Washington Post all thosekind of things that most of us havealways been privy to and YouTube hasmade a huge difference I think in a lotof people's lives because they're seeingthat that's humanizing theseconversationsthere's Britney's bringing nuance it'snot just memes you know and I thinkthat's wonderful and I hope that morepeople sort of look at both sides likethat like I did and I'm hoping that youknow we're looking at all these ralliesand everythingand these protests and I'm hoping thatour group I would go to a rally if wedid like a community outreach at thesame time because I think we really needto separate ourselves from you know justbeing against something being againstsomething all the time it's always justagainst it's like well what are you forbefore when I was on the left eyes verynihilistic Mike oh yeah just burn thewhole thing down and none of us workingfor anybody so just burn it all to theground and had no really idea what Iwanted specifically wanted to replacethe government with you know all of ourinstitutions it's just I just knew theywere wrong and I think that's a prettyimmature way to look at things you knowI was wrong about that and I thinkmoving forward it's a much healthier wayto look at it that we need to buildthings together and so if we're gonna doa rally you know do a community outreachget out there with garbage sacks andclean up your community wear your gearyou know have signs but be productiveyou know be a productive citizen and I'mloving getting to connect withconservatives who they very much thinkthat most of them very much think thatwaythey're very community oriented and Ireally appreciate that and so I'm hopingto bring that to my community you knowand be kind and respectful and just Iguess I'm a pragmatistyou know something else I didn't mentionin my other video was like where thoseideas had come from that I believed inlike questioning that you know thatrealizing a lot of the things I wasthinking was Marxist grace who is on thewalk away campaign she has a YouTubechannel called embarrassing mom and shewas a gender study major and she has awonderful breakdown if you guys want tocheck her out about where these ideasare coming from from the far left it'snot just out of nowhere I mean there'sit's so when you're trying to have aconversation with someone that's youknow on the left and they have a seem tohave a different vocabulary if there's avery specific place where the stuff iscoming from and so I think it's whoanybodyon the right to sort of look at that sothat you can have a more productiveconversation if you can have aconversation with people you know thatabout the identity politics and all thatkind of stuff that's pretty insane rightnow anyways I just also refill herefilled out my primary voter registeredvoter ballots and me my husband and wevoted red for the first time in ourlives pretty much down the ticket now Idid consider myself an independent andbut for the country and for bringing ustogether I think it's important toounless the Democrats you know come havea message can call out the extremists ontheir side I'm gonna have to voteRepublican for now I'm sorry that's justthe way it is I just I they with thesocialist stuff scare mea little bit and but for mostly I justwant to come to back together as youknow a country and have it okay to bepatriotic and yeah I think keep up thegood work I'm really impressed witheverybody's testimonials it has made meso hopeful and so grateful and made melove this country again and just want totake responsibility and do my partso anyways have a great day everybodymuch love bye"

1Ur8Qm7ySfg,hey my name is delle striker and I lovethe walk away campaign and it's beensuch a blessing in my life I just wantedto share a video I posted July 23rd andtold about my walk away experiences butI've had to walk away from a lot ofthings in my life when I was 17 I walkedaway from my Jewish whole town and LongIsland went to college and went to threedifferent colleges made it that back toBerkeley and Berkeley was quite anexperience and that's when I decided towalk away from college and ended uphitchhiking back to New York sent to akibbutz in Israel with my first husbandand I had to walk away from my firstcommune because they actually asked usto leave for kissing in front of thedining room so I had to walk away a lotand I had to walk away from Israelaltogether and made it to Europehitchhiked through Europe and came backto the States and ended up in the OzarkMountains and found my people in theMidwest hard-working kind loving peopleand lots of hippies were part of theback-to-the-land movement and then Jesusfound me at 24 so then I had to walkaway from the hippie friends becausethey didn't want to hear about Jesus andthen I ended up coming to Florida and Ifound it past my own congregation andagain walking away from my family whodidn't accept it and walked away from myfirst marriage because he didn't get mehe thought finding other women was okayand I did that the second time I foundthe same thing happening again so I hadto walk away from my second marriage butmy walk away political moments cameearly on back in the Ozarks when I readnone dare call a conspiracyand found out that really the worldbanking system ran everything and thedark this was you didn't wind up withthe Bible's that made a lot of sense soit kind of walked away from politics itwasn't till I passed through the chirpsI decided to become a Republican andthey will pro-life so let's before thatand Bill Clinton already done slime andperversion in the Oval Office whicheveryone seems to have forgotten andthey pay him exhorted about some moneyto speak and his wife just sat therereally I woulda had a frying pan outwould hit him over the head somethingsome kind of box I'm sensing somehow Ithink their marriage wasn't what itlooked like and I walked away from thatand wasn't excited about Bush though wevoted Republican always if they're Prois real and they're pro-lifelet's go for it give it a chance that'slesser of two evils and then the HolySpirit woke me up in August right beforeTrump's election said I want you to prayfor Donald Trump I kind of said are youkidding I knew him I didn't know muchabout him and then I realized not onlyis God asking me to intercede for himand I didn't expect him to win theelection I better start studying andfinding out what really is going on inthe political world YouTube has beengreat dinesh d'souza anomalyforgetting it so lost in YouTube boomfrom place to place I found outeverything that I already knew that thedarkness was huge and great and thecorruption was huge and great enough topoint to be sickening it was very hardto adjust to getting all thatinformation in and keeping a prayer lifeat the same time but it stirred myprayer life up and got me on the righttrack so I thank God for waking me upthrough Donald Trump definitely wasapathetic I thought there was no hopefor the government I thought we're allgonna be trisexual by the time we'redone um I don't think I ever thought inmy daythat it would get this bad it'sinteresting when you're 68 I've alwaysthought Jesus was coming back at a timeon 50 so we'd have to face any of thisnow I have to realize the prayer lifeand your recession has to be more thanit's ever been because we are on thebrink of something and this walkawaycampaign had only its waking up peopledaily but that is stirring the earth andsaying this gonna be a great revivalthere's gonna be a great greatoutpouring of his spirit in his loveit's gonna be divine it's not gonna bethrough church it's gonna be divineintervention of God with people wakingthem up and I want to be part of it Iwant to be praying for it I care aboutmy children my grandchildreneveryone's grandchildren I care aboutAmerica own what America's been built onwhat stands for I care about Israel andhow Israel finally has a friend andfinally has a president that has theguts to move the embassy and we have thepresident's first daughter in the WhiteHouse Jewish married to a Jew raisingthree Jewish children helloso I also want to share what it's liketo be a liberal liberalism is a diseaseit's a mental disorder it's also areligion and so people are really reallyupset that their religion is beingshipped to the core my faith and mybeliefs have always been shook a wholething my life and I started realizingthat really if I just think oppositethen I did as a hippie at age 23 gettingsaved at 24 that that's probably whatJesus would say what Jesus would do soI've been used to this but for peoplewho are not and believed in thiscorruption all these years just shake inthe very core of them the Bible saidthere's gonna be weeping and gnashingyour teeth we're getting hell is burpingis what's going on that's what's goingon the media they've gone crazy they'remad they're they're beyond logic thereis no logic to any ofbut in it in the darkness and in theugliness more people are running awayfrom the Democratic Party more peopleare getting awake and this is a chancefor a great revival this is a chance tobe a prayer warrior this is a chance tobe awake and studying and learning Imean there won't even be YouTube leftwe're gonna need books it's not a badtime to start saving books but we reallyneed each otherwe need to stand for the truth I don'treally want to hear about the media I'venever been a media person with thehippies we knew the media wasn't goodwas was faked back then how come some ofmy hippie friends hook line sinkerbelieve the mediaI got no idea we knew then that theywere teaching how to dress they wereteaching you what to wear they wereteaching you how to think that's whatthe whole Pippi movement was aboutknowing that the establishment wascorrupt I'm trying to push an agenda Idon't know what happened to peopleexcept complacency and I'd have becomecomplacent too I had going there's nohope why bother praying so I'm veryexcited for this campaign I just want toshare my heart I want to remind peoplethat what's going on in liberalism outof them now the heart speaketh so what'scoming out people's mouths is what's intheir heart and the only hope they haveis Jesus Christ the only hope they haveis salvation because the heart has tochange before the thoughts change andthe mind changes so thank you forwatching and I pray you have a blessedday that you start

223_vVNHGzI,"greetings in love a'tall you walk awayerrs out there who are assumed to be therunaway movement because it's runningaway like the runaway trump train now Ithink it's said 140,000 that it'sreached up I've been communicating withthis site since it started a littleEaster when I found out about it whichwas like July 2nd I suppose I don't knowhow long it's gone on but I've done someletters that had a hard time beingpublished through a series of mishapsand problems and also now I've had myvideo line that's gonna be on YouTubeand I put a longer version that's gonnabe on YouTube that was 25 minutes long alot of people have long ones on here butmine was keeps getting rejected for somereason so now there's all of a suddensaying everyone's has to be shorter soI'm making the short one with the timeron and I just have a lot of stuff tocover that I can talk about him 54 yearsold it was a Democrat most of my life Iwas in the Air Force at 17 years olduntil 21 and learned a lot about thegovernment and a lot about the world andthe way things work and when you're ontalking to people on this site they'rereading what people say in this site youknow a lot of the people are youngerpeople who all they know is Obama andBernie and you know the more recentstuff that's gone out of our countrythey're not really aware of well they'renot aware of the history of this countryvery much at all a lot of times you seethis on the some of the newer shows orthey ask you to fight the RevolutionaryWar who fought the Civil War they don'tknowyou literally know almost nothing so umit's very important for people to learnthat there's a historical political andmost importantly spiritual element toall of this my wife and I both have Lymedisease she's had it since 74 and I'vehad it since 94 and what I see happeningwith this walkaway movement is thatpeople are very sort of in shock they'rethey're surprised at the level ofanimosity and hatred that's falling outof people at them in their own familiesand this is something that we strangelyare used to because people with Lymedisease have their own line communityit's all worldwide and when you haveLyme disease it's very much like theearly days of AIDS where there's anextreme attack that goes along with itwhere you're not just sick and dying orfeeling bad you're brutally attacked bythe medical community by your familyyou're ostracized you're accused ofthinking for how sick you are it's anamazing experience to go through but ittrains you in what spiritual warfare iswe're experiencing in our society rightnow is an

23NeTd3DMz8,what's going on America this is Kevinand Kevin's corner and it looks likepeople are walking away from the dimrattle I would sing the second verse butI don't know the worst I'm pretty sureit's just hallelujah all the way throughbut nonetheless you get the point okayyeah they're leaving they're walkingaway and they should cuz these boots aremade for walkin that's just what they'lldo one of these days demo rats they'regonna walk all over you let me getfocused now the reason that this ishorrible for the demo rats is becausethese people that are walking awayleaving their testimonies are the worstpeople to walk away from the Democratsbecause see these people fit everystereotype every small interest groupevery identity politics category thatthe Democrats build their whole platformaround see it would be one thing ifpeople were walking away and there wereupper-class rich white men you know allthe libs would be like you know what howare you gonna walk away from somethingthat you never was a part of in thefirst placeyou weren't really with us because yourwhite privilege man you're not walkingaway we're kicking out or even as ablack person you know a brother whomight not have come from say hey youknow the culture hate will you knowdidn't come from Beverly Hills orsomething like that they you know theythey let you know well you know youcan't walk away you know what you areyou're still out to your own people manyou which your your your your your UncleTom your cool all of that stuff they tryto use those things to shame people likeyou know a per class white man even evenupper class white women you know theythey they just feel like you know you'redoing your people disservice fromwalking weight you know what you areyou're just being controlled by yourhusbandyou can't think for yourself but youhave people of all races colorsethnicitiessexual orientation I was watching somevideos and it was some transgenderpeople and they were just talking abouthow they felt like they have beenmanipulated all of these years by theDemocratic Party they said they didn'tsee these are people that you can't sitback and say you know what they werenever down with the Democrats anywaythese were people who was out theresocial justice warriors crying afterHillary loss you know thrown a fit andthen they start realizing that when itcomes down to the leftyou are only accepted based on yourloyalty to them see real friends theydon't walk away from you just becauseyou just disagree with them that's whatthey but the Democrats know see you'reonly a transgender if you support all ofthe transgender beliefs in theirecho-chamber soon is one of them say youknow what this is ridiculous why am iman I'm just walking around man fornothing cuz y'all told me I should bemad and as soon as they declare thatthen all of a sudden they don't want tobe affiliated with them anymoresame thing with black people now peopleare starting to realize what blackpeople been going through all theseyears when they decide to leave theDemocratic plantation immediately theythey feel that they got a corner amarket share of blackness so if youain't down with the Democrats they takeyour black card they start calling y'allkind of name it schooling racist UncleTom wellcan't call you racist but you know withall all those other words they like tocall us and now transgenders arestarting to see that they're beingpersecuted for it the guy who started itthe whole walk away movement he saidthat I saw him warned of judge Jeaninehe said he went in to buy some recordingequipment and they wouldn't even servehim and that that just shows howhorrible the left is in this progressivemovement because they talk about youknow dictatorships that talk about ohyou know what this is fascism and theypractice the same stuff that they accusethe the right of doing and the right isvery very tolerant when it comes down toembracing people of different racesethnicity sexual orientation it's notabout all that stuff it's about how yourespect everybody else and how you viewaAmerica and some of the values that wehave I don't care what you do in theprivacy of your own home I'm not here tochase you down until you know whatyou're you're not you're not rightbecause you did this and you did thatI'm like look man let me be but that'sthe difference see the left feel likethey gotta walk around fine and victimsand it just goes from one victim toanother it's never okay we found enoughvictims guys let's go ahead and wrap itup no no they're going okay we're stillout here safe searching for more victimsand they go from one victim to the nextand not only that they like to get inyour business now why would you want tobe a part of an organization a movementa party they want to get all in yourbusiness they want to get in your healthcare they want to get in your religionthey want to get into your speech theywant to get into your first and secondAmendment they want to get into everyelement of your life they want to getinto your brain and they say if youdon't think like we think they can'tjust say we disagreeyou're evil you know what you're racistas it aful hugga for your all of thesethings you're not just a person whodisagrees you're not just a person whocomes up with logical practicingpolicies no you're an evil wicked personand then you wonder why people arewalking away from the Democrats indroves and I'm so glad that they'rewaking up because the Democrats are fullof garbage why would you want to be apart of them when all they do is walkaround being mad for nothing they arethe most angriest and tolerant people onthe planet at this point and it's allbeing propagated by the left and when Isay the left I'm not talking about thepeople remember the people runningaround are victims of this manipulationand these are the people a lot of themthat are walking away they're openingtheir eyes and say man I have beenmanipulated I have been being used andthey have been preying upon my anger myinsecurities my fears they're creatingall these narratives that they tell me Ineed to buy - they're telling me that Imust think like this because I'm blackor I'm gay or I'm a lesbian or a Jewthey're telling me how to think and thatis stinking thinkingokay and I don't like no stinkingthinking all right I'm an individual Ican think what I want to think and Idon't care if they call me all kind ofnames and the right isn't racing all ofthese people that are saying I'm wakingup and I'm walking on over to the to thelight I'm coming into the light okay soanyway I chuckle I laugh even though nowthey're trying to suppress it I know oneperson she did a video and now they'rereferencing that these must be RussianBOTS not all of these testimonies aretrue these are just the Russians onceagain everything's Russians it's theRussians they've gotten involvingthey're manipulating the system yeahthey're doing a preemptive strike on thepeople who are walking away because theycan't afford to take off they can'tafford it to become a real movement cuzthat messes up their our whole strategyremember outside of them telling youyou're a victim you know what this issexism this is racismthis is xenophobia this is you know whatI heard somebody say a phobia means it'san unhealthy unwarranted fear ofsomething the stuff that they're tryingto out fear homosexuals I don't fearillegal immigrants I don't fear anybodythere you know and so they're runningaround creating fears you know fear isfalse evidence appearing real they'recreating fears I'm just thinkinglogically just because I disagree withthe legal immigration you know I'm notan illegal folk you know I'm none ofthose things just because maybe certainpeople's / lifestyle that they practiceI might not practice that don't make mehomophobic xenophobic or whatever itjust makes me say well whatever suitsyou buddymight have at it I'm gonna do whatever Ido but it doesn't have to come down tojust because you disagree that must meanyou're fearful of it I'm going you'rejust making up stuff winging it you'rejust looking for reasons to be mad and Ithink people are starting to wake up andsay wait a minute I'm just walkingaround angry all the time how can youlive your life like thathow could you just wake up every day andsay let me go find more problems be madabout and things just fuss about and youknow what I'm gonna do I'm gonna createall kind of trouble and I'm gonna stirup stuff and I'm gonna show up inpeople's jobs and I'm gonna go ahead andrest people and rest aroundand I'm gonna tell them how I feel andwhat needs to be done and how theythinking how evil they are but I'm notgonna give any solutions I'm not gonnagive any solutions so why would anybodywant to follow a

2f9mVav3O70,hi everybody my name is Brie I've beenwatching everybody's videos and beenreally inspired by them so I decided tomake my own I have always been a liberalvery liberal probably far-leftI was a Bernie supporter and Ireluctantly voted for Trump because ofwhat happened to Bernie in the primariesyou know I remember the first Clintonand I just couldn't get behind HillaryClinton so what made me start walkingaway was after the election the completehysteria like the world was endingcoming from the left from my sidecalling people names racist bigots lowIQ voters you know and I'm like I votedfor Trump I'm none of those things I'mnot a racist I'm not a bigot anotherhomophobe I have no problem with anybodyyou know live and let live that's whatI've always thought and you knowtreating conservatives like second-classcitizensand seeing it online sing it person I itI was disgusted by it I'm like I thoughtwe were supposed to be tolerant andloving and that's not what I was seeingat all and so my brother who was alittle further along in his journey thanme sent me some video some YouTubevideos on like social justice warriorswhich I used to be one completely demondidn't even know itI was completely part of that echochamber you know sharing just stupidarticles and you know thinking Americawas the worst country in the worldyou know colonialization all of that youknow when I had no idea where thatactually came from and so I startedresearching and realizing that a lot ofthe things I thought and a lot of thingsI believed were Marxist straight up KarlMarxI read Karl Marx you know started realreading history and I'm embarrassed tosay you know supporting a socialist andnot even knowing what that meantand how it's been horrendous for a lotof countries you know I read Mao's GreatLeap Forward Gulag Archipelago aboutwhat happened in Russia you know I cameacross Jordan Peterson and ret you knowlistened to a ton of his YouTube videosand just realized what I was spewing outand how that is going to end up tearingthe country apart because it's alloppressor vs. oppressed and it's nothelpful for anybody it makes me reallysad actually because if you're alwaysthinking your victim then there'snothing you can do and you're tellingpeople of color and gay people thatthey're victims you know saying youright out of the gate you have no shot Ijust think it's sad and I am NOT for itand I am glad that I've sort of seen thelight because you know like JordanPeterson says you know clean up your ownroom before you know get your own lifein order before you go out and try tochange the world and so that's what I'vetaken on for myself it's just how can Imake my small little world better myneighborhood you know be the mom thatall the kids can come over to her houseyou know watch out for each other youknow just within your small littlemicrocosm of the world because typing ona keyboard and being nasty to people isnot going to help anybody it's justgonna make the climate you know worseand another thing I realize thisconservatives aren't evil they just havea different way of looking at things andwhen you just assign you know evil badto somebody just because of an opinionyou'll never listen to what they have tosay and so I've really you know once Istart educating myself realized that youknow we are all a human we are all juston our own path most of us love ourfamilies we just want the best foreverybody andso what if we have different opinions onpolicy I won't be judging anybody forthat anymoreand but I and I also won't be getting onthe calling liberals name trains eitherbecause I you know I see it from bothsides that doesn't help you know so allI can do is educate myself on issues andtry to look at both sidesI'm definitely landing more classicalliberal now you know moderate centriston the right on a lot of stuff now youknow pro-second amendment Pro freespeech which is actually a conservativething now crazyshould we should all want that you knowreading history like I said helps toknow where we came from you know what wefought forit's it's really important yes but thishas been very humbling but I have hopeand it starts with each one of us justdoing what we can in our little areas Imean so I guess yeah that's all we cando and yeah I won't be voting for aparty that calls everybody racists andNazis and I'm hoping the hysteria willdie down because it's reallydisheartening you know I can't this is asecond YouTube Facebook channel becauseI can't even go on my regular Channelthis you know my facebook feed is justcancer it's just people hating on eachother I'm not gonna have I I like peoplewhen I'm in a you know when you'rearound people face to face they're nicepeople are generally good you get onsocial media and it's just a cesspool Ican't even do Twitter yeah so I'm justnot gonna I'm not going to do it thiscampaign has sort of made me hopefulbecause reading people's comments andseeing that people can have a dialoguewith each other even though you knowmaybe somebody's protip pro-choicepro-life they're not being awful to eachand that's how we should be and that'syou know I'm hoping that we can getthereso anyways keep up the good workeverybody I really enjoy your videos andyeah I'll be looking forward to thefuture so bye

2hgXR_aQZNI,[Music]i want to share my walk away story withyou guys in hopes that it might helpsomebody elsewalk away uh or help somebody else justfeel like they've been validated becausethat's what this movement has donefor me so growing up as a kid mydad was the type of person who justdidn't share their political views backthen nobody really talked aboutwhat they believed in or who they votedfor and when i turned 18it was kind of a rite of passage uh youknow when i went to vote for the firsttime my dadyou know outed that he was aconservative uh you know and and growingupi've i always felt a sense of pride uhyou knowespecially with the star-spangled bannerand the pledge of allegiance you knowthey they even playedthe star spangled banner every morningin school and wesaid the pledge of allegiance and iremember having that sense ofpride uh for being an american and then9 11 happened when i was a junior inhigh schooland i remember that feeling and it wasthe first time that i really didn't feelsafe in america um it was a scaryday it was a scary time and you know iremember those times i remember you knowwhythat war started and in this war that'sgone onfor so long it seems like it doesn'thave an ending soyou know i was a democrat because ididn't want i didn't really like mydad's values i guess i was youngkind of rebellious so of course you knowi didn'twant to just go with what he said so i ibecame a democrat you know i thoughtit was the party of acceptance and andthat's who i am as a person i accepteveryone as long as they don't doanything to me i don't i don't careabout you know the color of your skin oror who you choose to worship andand have faith in and i don't care whoyou love i loveeveryone uh the same we're we're allamericans we're all humansand so i thought that's what thedemocratic party was aboutso i voted for obama the first termi did not vote at all the second termfor him i didn't agreehe didn't bring the hope and change isaw a lot of things that i didn't likebut it still didn't you know kind oflink that to the democratic party i justthought okaywell hopefully in 2016 we'll have abetter candidatewell we didn't so i didn't vote inthat election either because i was ademocrat and i really didn't know abouttrump i thought maybeum you know he he was just playing agame oryou know whatever i mean the mediacoverage about him i believed all of thestuff they were sayingso you know after he was elected thoughi started to realizethat you know some of the things thatthey were saying justweren't true and i started to really seethe attacks and not just the attacks ontrumpthe attacks on people who supportedtrump and for mei was like hey you know that that's notthe way that we're supposed to bethinking that's not what we stand forand and why are we attacking thesepeople but they're not attackingus not as much anyway and they're notbeingviolent and there's not these hategroups uh forminguh of trump supporters right and so ireally started to listen to what trumpwas actually sayingand i started to really start to agreewith what he was sayingbut i thought maybe i was a little crazyi was really really scareduh to to debate anybody or talkabout any of it until i saw brandon'swalk away video andit touched me deep down in my soulbecause he really validated everythingthat i had been feelinghe validated that it's okay to walk awayfrom something that you just don'tbelieve inand so after i saw his video i was soexciteduh you know the first thing i did wascall my dad and tell him heyi'm not you know i'm not a democratanymore i'm goingto register as a you know aa conservative and i wassuper excited uh you know to kind ofjoin this movement and start talking topeoplebut when i started talking to peoplethey started treating me horriblycalling me names calling me a racist idon't havea racist bone in my body uh you knowit's justall kinds of really vile things and sothis group the people in this thiscommunity reallyuh in the walk away campaign they reallymade me feelvalidated and i have never felt so muchlove and acceptanceuh and and had good debates with peopleeveruh before meeting people in this thiscommunity and it's beenamazing amazing i've met some such goodfriendsand we are seeing the democratic partyjustgo insane like some of the things thatthey are sayingand doing it's just crazy and andthey're acting like childrenand i just think that we need better wedeservebetter and it really feels like thedemocratic party now is really justagainst americaall together and what we stand for and iilook back and i remember that pride andi remember being prouduh and i haven't felt that in a longtime untili went to a trump rally and i actuallygot to meet brandon there and heis the most genuine person ever the imean he's just amazing he'sreal uh so when i was at when we were atthe trump rallyi felt that feeling of being patrioticagaini felt that feeling of being proudagainst to be an americanand that's something that i don't idon't want to lose and i don't want tolet goso that's my walk away story and my walkwith storyis it doesn't matter who you are to thisthis group of peopleuh that have decided to walk away itdoesn't matter you'reyou can we all have different views andwe all have different opinions aboutthings andyou know we all we all are differenthumans we're different people with withour own brains and we can think forourselvesand the one thing that i can say aboutthis community and the people that ichoose to walk with nowis that even if we don't agree we canagree to disagree and we

2mF1zCotWXk,what's up guys you know what so I can'tleave this walkaway campaign aloneI want to capitalize while you knowstrike while the iron is hot I didn'twant to include this in my videoyesterday just because I didn't want itto be too long but there is one otherhuge elephant in the roomas far as reasons why I walked away fromthe Democratic Party and I will neverever vote for the Democratic Party againand that reason is the myth that theparty switched at some point alonghistory in America that the DemocraticParty and Republican Party magically dida big switch and the Democrats the badguys suddenly became the good guys andthe Republicans were the good guys andwent from the good guys to be in the badguys that southern strategy that RichardNixon wanted to campaign in the southjust to be competitive is a myth and thefact that I was taught that in schoolknowing that the facts are out therethat the party's never switched is itjust pisses me off you know it's just afurther validation that the publicschool system is failed the fact thatthe government controls theindoctrination they control thecurriculum therefore they control thenarrative you know it makes you wonderwhat our kids learning today that we'regonna see down the road is a lie they'regonna wake up and realize wow I wasduped they told me Donald Trump was afascist they told me Barack Obama wasone of the greatest presidents inhistory kids could very well be learningthat right now I don't have kids rightnow but when I do you best believe I'lleither be homeschooling them or sendingthem to private school or charterschools something else they're not goingto public school just because it's it'ssuch a fallacy that you know you canteach someone whatever you want them tolearn and the parents have no say-so init you know the curriculum is all messedup so anyway I don't want to get off onthe tangent I want to talk about how theDemocrat and Republican Party neverswitched and I don't need all of thedates and all the historical facts forit because it's just so plain to see youknow how about this we all know theRepublican Party was founded in 1854 inopposition to slavery right to keep itfrom expanding to the West and you knowthe civil the civil war happened as aresult of it and they won and theRepublican Partyported the 13 14 and 15 amendments forslaves you know free in the slavesmaking them citizens allowing them tovote the Democratic Party was against itagainst all three of those amendmentsright then you have the first blackpolitician ever was Republican MartinLuther King was a Republican you knowthe only reason that there was a switchwas the black voter switched from theRepublican Party to the Democratic Partyso the only strategy that reallyhappened was the welfare strategy that'sright the LBJ Act I believe it was 1964the Great Society act where he realizedokay well blacks are voting now so thatmeans that their vote makes a differencewe have to figure out a way to get themI'm probably butchering the quote but hepretty much said you know I'll havethose in words vote Democrat for thenext 200 years we have to give himsomething but not enough to make adifference so insert the Great Societywelfare act and then ever since thatWelfare Act single motherhood in theblack community is up like 73 percentsince the 1960s also the PlannedParenthood you know Margaret Sanger waslike a lady Ku Klux Klan member and shetalked about eugenics and how blackpeople need to be controlled by weedsthese are all facts that you guys canlook up you know for anybody that'sgonna come in the comments section talkabout this walk away movement there'speople bragging about going fromDemocrat to Republican it's not evenabout that it's about breaking away fromthe narratives you know detachingyourself from your victimhood status thesacred cows status has been given to youby the Democrats and become a sovereignfree-thinking individual that you wereborn to be it's your divine purpose tobe a free-thinking independent person soback to this whole Democrat Republicanswitch right so you had Margaret Sangerwith Planned Parenthood which by the wayPlanned Parenthood's are mostly inminority communities go look across allof America they're mostly in minoritycommunities eugenics is a real thingthey're actually doing eugenics inIceland right now but eugenics inAmerica was used to you knowexterminate the black race and with theWelfare Act that was passed by LBJ youknow that got black people votingDemocrat but the difference is they hadto get the parent out of the home thefather out of the home so what did thatdo that means kids were growing upwithout a parent without their fatherand then you incentivize single mothersto marry the government and then fathersweren't able to get jobs they werelocked up and then insert Bill Clintonin the nineties with his crime bill actsupported by Democrats not supported byRepublicans see it's coincidence rightright you're gonna say the party switchyet the Republicans have had theirfingerprints all over everything havingto do with freedom they've always beenthe party of freedom the DemocraticParty has always been the party ofslavery Jim Crow KKK all the segregationlaws you know they voted against all ofthe civil rights legislation theyfilibustered stuff you know thatfilibuster rule was made famous byDemocrats you know so Bill Clinton withhis crime bill locked up more black menthan any other president in UnitedStates history okay so the I mean thehistorical facts are there but if peoplewant to deny the historical facts okaylet's talk about modern-day DemocraticParty modern-day slavery modern-dayslave plantations okay so use the eyetest go to any mostly black Democrat runcity you know your Cleveland yourChicago

2vbO2Tlzn8I,hello everyone so today I'm gonna sharewith you my walkaway story I've beenwatching some of your some of yourWalker weight stories and inspired me toshare mine so here it is so I grew up inNorthern California very liberal part ofthe country I was raised by a veryliberal minded family on my mother'sside I went through the Californiapublic school system my whole life whichas you can imagine this in the mostpro-america minded organization in thecountry and as a 20 21 22 year old I wastrying to get my feet underneath me andsupport myself but I just couldn't finda job couldn't find a job my mom at thetime couldn't find a job she was veryqualifiedshe was very qualified she had a lot ofexperience in a very prominentwell-thought-out popular field and inthat state but couldn't find a job atthe time though work force participationrate was the hot was the lowest that ithad been in 40 years at this time theunemployment rate where I was living atin in Sacramento California was was veryhigh and all that I heard from anyonewas that it's all the Conservativesfalse and one day the penny just droppedfor me and I you know realized you knowthere aren't any there aren't anyconservatives here where this place isrun by Liberal Democrats these problemsare caused by Liberal Democrats um on myanalysis of liberal ideology of theDemocratic Party's ideology I agree withthem on the on the ends of things but Idon't always agree with them on themeans to those ends I think that themeans that they're implementing causegreater problems and actually lead themfarther away than what they're actuallytrying to accomplish you know they wanteveryone to have health insurance theywant everyone to be healthy they wanteverybodyto have a doctor I like that idea Ithink that's a good idea but I don'tagree with the means of giving moremoney to the government to pay forthings well equate to the problem wethat's just more of the same thing thatwe have been doing we were you knowspending trillions of dollars on thisproblem isn't going to make the problemgo away when we tried spending billionson it and millions on itthe problem isn't a lack of governmentspending it's a lack of we're formingthe system okay you know the democraticparties say that there for women'srights there for protecting women Ithink that's a great idea but they onlybut they minimize women's rights toabortions and and getting free birthcontrol right women have freedom ofspeech Democratic Party doesn't defendthat women have a right to protectthemselves how they have a right to owna gunDemocratic Party is trying to suppressthat women have private property rightswomen owned businesses women have moneywomen rely on businesses to survive andthe Democratic parties just just triedto suppress and to stop that it'sthey're in the business of taking wealthfrom people taking wealth from womenmanipulating markets to benefit marketsin the economy to benefit the rulingelite over everybody else over thesewomen who own businesses over you knowor if they don't own businesses isn'tbusinesses that women rely on to surviveright they're all about suppressing thatright the Democratic Party says thattherefore fighting for theafrican-american community and providingthem justice and social justice I thinkthat's a good idea but then againthey're the African American communityhas freedom of speech with the deafwhich the Democratic Party is trying tocensor and and stop the African Americancommunity has you know owns weapons wehave the Democratic Party is trying totake guns away from them the AfricanAmerican community has has money but theDemocratic Party is just always tryingto take more money from them throughtaxation or the african-americancommunity owns businesses or they orthey rely on businesses to survive butyeah the Democratic Party is all aboutmanipulating the markets to benefityou know the ruling elite over everybodyelse the Democratic Party says thattherefore you know the common individualand against the big bad evilcorporations and I think that can be agood idea but then they go ahead andthey support systems like the FederalReserve banking system which givesmonopoly power on creating the world'sreserve currency to a group of smallelitist bankers whose identities wedon't know right today's thereforesystems like the export-import bankwhich is a system created by the federalgovernment which does nothing other thangive huge loans to major corporationswith money from the common individualright there for other crony capitalistlegislation like increasing you knowlike investing the people's money andbusinesses which is very cronycapitalist I don't support so at thattime I decided to walk away from theleft and I consider myself conservativehowever I don't think that the battle inpolitics is left versus right or red vs.blue Republican versus DemocratI think the a better description of thebattle and politics is really top downit's really vertical it's really thepeople at the top of the system peoplewho work for the government people whorun businesses who are manipulatinggovernment to benefit them they'recentralizing more power to them versusthe people the common individual personwho doesn't have connection to that tothat system to that network that's wherethe battle is and the debate is I thinkthe you know I think the a gooddescription of the problem isn't left orliberal but it's statist statistis involved in both political partiesyou know the status say that thesolution say that the reason why youdon't have a good life the reason whythings are hard for you is because thepeople at the top of the system don'thave enough money and power to makeeverything fair and equal and balancedforeverbuddy and only and if only you wouldjust give them more of your money andlet them control more aspects of yourlifewell everything for you and everybody atthe bottom of the pyramid become betterwhich isn't true by the more that wecentralize more money to the state orpower to the state the worse that thingsget for people at the bottom and I thinkwhat we need to be doing is we need tobe reforming the systems reforming thegovernment reforming the way reformingthe relationship between government andbusiness so that it works better forpeople it's more so it works better forpeople and it's more an

don'twant to get beat up they don't want toget threatened they don't want to becalled names they don't want to betreated like second-class citizens theydon't want their public servants onlyserving half the countrythe only thing that is going to savethis country is love and an acceptanceand understanding that we're alldifferent but we're all the sameyoutaking me quite a while to get up mycourage to make this video I joined thewalkway movement when I was practicallyapproximately say 3,800 people and thereason I joined the walkway movement wasbecause I walked away I was a lifelongDemocrat and towards the end of not eventowards the end I'd say I voted forPresident Obama twice but somewhere inhis second termI started feeling disillusioned I didn'tlike what I was seeing going on in ourcountry there's a lot of things I livefive minutes from Baltimore and I couldsee what was happening there but whatreally gave me my walk away was adisillusioned moment and what happenedwas I was exploring the the candidatesbecause I knew I wasn't gonna vote forHillary Clinton because I had watchedHillary's America and some other thingsand I was completely not absolutely notjust like I never voted for Barack Obamabecause it was black I wasn't gonna votefor Hillary Clinton because she was awoman I don't like that that is never adetermining factor I don't make choicesbased on sex or race or sexualorientation or anything like thatthat's not how I make my decisions soanyway I was watching I decided I wasgonna watch a trump rally because Iheard so much prop about him and so muchnegativity and whatnot and just onFacebook because like I said I don'treally watch TV and I definitely don'twatch mainstream media and never Ihaven't for a while but anyway so I saidI'm gonna watch this Trump rally I'mgonna see what's going on he almost whoeverybody you know what's going on soimagine my surprise when the rally wascanceleddue to threats of violence I couldn'tbelieve it I was like wait a minutethis is the United States of America andyou know if you don't want to hearsomebody speak you just don't go if youdon't want to partake of informationthat you don't feel be beneficial to youyou just don't listen or if you reallywant to be informed you listen and youtake it in and then you decide what youwant to do with that informationat least that's you know what I do andthat's what I believe so when I saw thatI said why is going on why would threatsof violence and I got on my laptop and Istarted looking on YouTube and pullingup all these videos that weren't on thenews even though I turned on themainstream media and I can't rememberwhat station was I couldn't even tellyou who the people were that we'retalking but um the next thing I knewwhat I was seeing on the screen and whatthey were talking about were two totallydifferent things I was seeing innocentpeople husbands wives children you nameit being verbally attacked physicallyassaulted things thrown at them um andI'm like who is doing this it was youknow what's killing of what why arethese people being attacked it's how Igot on my computer like I said in it Icouldn't believe what I saw these wereDemocrats I was a Democrat I freaked outI was like I was terrified for thesepeople I said I was like how in thegreatest country on Earth in the UnitedStates of America are people not allowedto go to a rally they hear someone speakand then as my journey that nightbecause I stayed up late that night Istarted seeing all these other thingswhere things going on college campusesandand violence and radicalism and allthese people were doing this under theumbrella of the Democrats wellimmediately I I just couldn't believe itI I said I can't believe this is theDemocratic Party that I belong to andthen I said well let me see I knew theDemocratic Party or at least you knowthose in power and Democrat rightthey're denouncing this they have to beno now they were not denouncing it I wasyou've got to be kidding menobody in the in it you know as a DNC orany of these Democratic senators orprogramnobody is saying anything the Presidentof the United States is not sayinganything about people American citizensbeing attacked physically attacked fortheir political views or who knows whatpolitical affiliation these people werethey were going to a rally to hearsomeone speak we don't know if therewere Republicans or independents orlibertarians or demography we don't knowyou know you can't tell just by lookingat somebody what their politicalaffiliation is so mm-hmmI was upset and the next day I went onthe internet and I removed myself fromthe Democratic Party I said they're notgonna stand up to this and they're notgonna say hey you know these people weredoing this under the umbrella of theDemocratic Party but we do not condonepeople go into a trump rally being theircars being vandalized and beingassaulted and whatnot and you know whooif you're not going up well they say youyou you you know you stand for nothingyou fall for anything well to me I feltlike the Democratic Party was by notcondemning this violence and theseassaults they were condoning it and Idon't care if you hate Donald Trump Idon't care if you don't like him youthinkhe's you know um he's not polished andoffer he's he's too brash or whatever Idon't care that doesn't give you theright to assault people so not reallyknowing the political climate as well asI should have I feel like you know Ifeel like I was always that proverbialostrich with their head and his sandbecause of course like I said at first Ididn't want to leave it was DemocraticParty doing this and in second Icouldn't believe that wasn't beingcondemned and then I said I can't be apart of this and the next day I wentonline and I removed myself from theDemocratic Party I said until they gettheir act together I'm out I do notbelieve in violence I don't believe inattacking people but then I startedseeing all people's Facebook pages cuzmy brother I have a brother who is astaunch Republican I mean he is he is apatriot 100% he is all American butanyway I started seeing all these peopleattacking other people on Facebook andlike viciously attacking people on therejust for their opinions even if somebodysaid something as simple as you know Ithink I'm gonna you know consider mr.Trump I'm gonna go to you know read hisplatform what are you guys I mean familyagainst family brothers and sistersagainst the parents against childrenchildren against parents and then I sortof find out about all this stuff onthese college campuses that these kidsin college were being basicallybrainwashed by these so-callededucators and then fast forward to nowwe have actual politicians who weresupposed to work for everyone in thecountry standing up with a microphonetelling people to harass other peopleno you can't eat here no you can't getguests here no you can't shop here youneed to go somewhere else because you'rea trump supporter or your your you knowyou're not a Democrat so in other wordsyou only represent a half of the countryyou don't represent the whole country noyou're in the wrong job you need toretire and go mix knit yourself somescarves or something or find a hobbybecause honey a public servant servesthe public not just the ones that theywant to support this is ridiculous Icannot believe I still cannot wrap myhead around the fact that I wasterrifiedto make this video because I was afraidas an author and a writer an independentwriter author that I'm going to gettrashed on Amazon Goodreads becausepeople

31pyCFPOTVY,[Music]good morning walk away movement I hopeyou all are doing well this weekendI know it's been such a tough time and Iwas watchingBrandon struts video over the weekendand he asked those of us who are eithera walk with or a walk away to do a videoI am a walk with for the most part Ihave voted Republican since college myfirst time to vote was in thepresidential election and I did vote forBill Clinton and obviously haveregretted that ever since what has ledme in my life to be a Republican isbecause I had family members who ownbusinesses and were ranchers and justseeing the importance of having somebasic liberties and also to not be taxedto where you can't reach your fullpotential and so as I've gotten older itwent beyond the principles of justfiscal issues to social issues for meand wanting to protect the unborn andjust I think also just respect for lifeand liberty has just become so importantto me and it's been really proven to bea principle that just is essential for asuccessful country we are rapidly losingour liberties through the shutdownprocess and I'm just so concerned aboutthat and so I'm very grateful for ourgovernor McMaster who is starting toopen up our state and we're going to goto Savannah today this show support forgovernor camp and it's tough I mean andno one's probably going to look great ina crisis and but I think at the end ofthe day we need to let our bizmake some decisions for themselves andlet the individuals to this is one ofthe reasons why I am a conservative it'sto conserve life and liberty and I havelike other members of this movement lostfriends over the years because of myvalues and beliefs and even though wedidn't talked about them they just knewI was a Republican and so because ofthat I had some friends just they walkedaway from me and it's painful it doeshurt and what I have decided to do isthe doors always open and I think abouthow Brandon kept the door open for hisfriend in Nebraska she kept the dooropen to him which led to this movementif she had unfriended him on Facebook hewould not have found evidence of thebias in the media against our presidentand so I think that keeping the dooropen keeping the lines of communicationeven if people don't agree with us andthey leave if even if they're not supernice either about itand if they are a friend they will comeback and if not it's okay to let them goand I just think this movement iswonderful so proud of Brandon hiscourage and his strength and energy andI just hope you all will be finethe situation actually will be more thanfine we'll come out victorious on theother side of this and I think theprinciples of life and liberty are whatwill unite us all we are not perfect theRepublican Party is not perfect justlike there's no such thing as a perfectfamily a perfect church perfect personso we have to give each other a lot ofgrace and forgiveness and mercy and justhold to thosefounding principles of life and libertyand I will add love into that as welland though that is what will keep ustogether and make our movementsuccessful I wish you all a very happySunday and I hope we get to the otherside of this year very soonlove you all goodbye

3cXmSBsJ2og,hello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for myself and not the hashtagBrandon so brilliantly came up with Iwould call it the walk back homemovement for myself because I was aRepublican from a very early age Ivolunteered on George HW Bush's primarycampaign in 1980 and then I registeredas a Republican when I turned 18 inChicago and I remained a Republicanuntil I moved to New York when I was 25years old and 1992 and people told mewhen I moved here if you want to berelevant you've got to be a Democrat inthis town and I thought well if I wanderstay irrelevant I would've stayed inChicago so I registered as a Democratand that year I voted for Bill Clintonmy first democratic president that Ivoted for and I remained a Democrat I'llbe it a Democrat who voted for a lot ofRepublicans I voted for Giuliani I votedfor Bloomberg I voted for GovernorPataki I pretty much mixed it up but Ivoted for all Democratic presidentsthrough Secretary Clinton and then onNovember 8th 2016 i sat there and I wasin shock I was in shock and I wasworried I had a lot of reasonduring the campaign I felt to be worriedabout Donald Trump I thought he wouldget us into nuclear war I thought hewould get us into a recession he is doneneither and I'm very pleasantly shockedand surprised by President Trump aspresident and his performance but thenight of November 8th 2016 I did notknow that I would be pleasantlysurprised I was devastated of that nightand I thought I just didn't understandhow it could happen and so I came homeand after President Trump gave hisacceptance speech I did find myselffeeling relieved because there had beena lot of speculation that the resultswould bedid that the election would go onforever I remember what 2000 was likewith bush and gore I did not want torelive that and so I was relieved atleast that the issue was settled it wasa very ugly campaign and I was glad itwas over and I was also in all honestygrateful to live in a country where atleast one person had voted for thepresident so I went on to Facebook about320 in the morning and I effectivelysaid you are my president presidentelect Trump congratulations in yourhard-won victory you have my prayers mysupport god bless americaI meant that I was truly grateful inthat moment to be in to live in ademocratic country and the blowbackpersonally to me kind of offline was wasnasty and it it kind of opened my eyesto the bigotry of the left and I starteddoing research I started reading Iwanted to make sense of why he wonbecause it didn't make sense to me thenight had happened and I talked to a lotof people ended up talking to very smartvery compassionate Trump voters and Iwas kind of reminded of why I had becomea Republican in the first placeit's because I value absolutely freedomof the individual overseas you knowsocial engineering frankly and I'm not abig fan of people sitting in the sentocentralization of power and remote powerI don't I'm not a fan of that never havebeen but I'm gay so when I became aDemocrat it felt natural do 92 and thenwhen gay marriage really when I wasyoung gay marriage was just like it waslike us all of us I mean people talkedabout two men getting married the sameway you would talk about a UFO landingit was the same level of probabilityso when gay marriage really became alegitimate issue when people startedtalking about marriage equality and whenyou know certain states likeMassachusetts and then there was talk ofHawaii at one point I was not going toleave the Democratic Party when theDemocratic Party was the only party eventhough Obama andwere against gay marriage in 2008 if youwere for gay marriage you had to be aDemocrat that's where it was happeningand that's ultimately who made it happenthere's talk that in New York State alot of Republicans just one of the issuegone and so they went to come on saidwell let's get this taken care of and Ibelieve that but let's keep givingcredit where credit is duemarriage equality was a democratic issueand the Democrats helped me to propel italong but that's one issue and there area lot of other issues that factor in intoday's world and after the election ofDonald Trump trying to make sense of theelection of Donald Trump I really gotback in touch with those issues andpeople explain things to me and I did alot of reading I did a lot of reading onmy own and seeing where country is goingthe role that immigration was playinghow people were using immigration and Icame to a lot of conclusions on my ownand it wasn't so much a rejection of aDemocratic Party although I did see alot of dysfunction there that I wasnever comfortable with but I believe inindividual liberty I believe that all ofus were just born with inherent rightsand we need to keep the government frominfringing on those rights governmentdoesn't give us rights were born withthat that's how I really truly believethat and I also believe in diversity ofthought one of the reasons I was drawnback to the Republican Party which Iregistered as a Republican just over ayear ago is that you don't know in theRepublican Party you have to ask someoneare you pro-choice do you pro-lifebecause they're both people there you'vegot to ask on all the issues there'strue diversity of thought and to methat's an incredibly interesting placeto be and it's the most natural place tobe there is no group thank theRepublican Party you do most likely youcan't assume that anyone's coming fromany one place and that's a great thatthat's a good place to be it's in twofor me so for me coming back to theRepublican Party after the election ofDonald Trump was certainly interesting alot of people like why nowbut seeing President Trump what he'sdone getting beyond the personality andthe Twitter and all that stuff and tothe actual results and the resolve thathas made a lot of sense to me and I'mvery proud to be a Republican I'm veryproud to be a trump supporter I did notthink I'd be saying that ever and onething I definitely didn't think I'd besaying in the age of Trump is that I'mrunning for office shortly after comingback to the Republican Party I wasrecruited by the Manhattan GOP to runfor state Senate and you're new here inManhattan in Trump's district district28 so I am the Republican candidate forNew York state Senate I'm also theReform Party candidate and we're on thestop de Blasio line and hopefully theindependence line and you know will makethings happen but this has been a veryinteresting time for me coming back tothe Republican Party walking away fromthe Democratic Party and getting to aplace where people can really tell thetruth the Republican Party is a big tentparty there are a lot of differentopinions and I love that and feel veryat home there I always did if I hadn'tbeen if I hadn't been gay I probablywould never have left the RepublicanParty to be honest and it doesn't throwmy death the Republicans were not opento gay people for a very long time itdoesn't thrill me but I don't judgepeople that what happened ten years agoI don't judge my boyfriends by what theydid ten years ago I'm not going to judgemy political party by what they did tenyears ago what's important now in anydecision whether it be a personalrelationship or a political party for meis what is happening now what ishappening today and I see the RepublicanParty being the party that's reallyprotecting the American peopleand the future of the American peopleand the freedom of the American peopleto say whatever the heck they want theparty of the first amendment is theRepublican Party in my opinion thesedays and freedom of speech is everythingto me it's the most important thing soI'm Pete Holmberg I'm a walk awaycandidateI'm the Republican candidate for NewYork State Senate in district 28 and Iam proud to have walked away and walkedhome to the Republican Party thank youhello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for

interesting alot of people like why nowbut seeing President Trump what he'sdone getting beyond the personality andthe Twitter and all that stuff and tothe actual results and the resolve thathas made a lot of sense to me and I'mvery proud to be a Republican I'm veryproud to be a trump supporter I did notthink I'd be saying that ever and onething I definitely didn't think I'd besaying in the age of Trump is that I'mrunning for office shortly after comingback to the Republican Party I wasrecruited by the Manhattan GOP to runfor state Senate and you're new here inManhattan in Trump's district district28 so I am the Republican candidate forNew York state Senate I'm also theReform Party candidate and we're on thestop de Blasio line and hopefully theindependence line and you know will makethings happen but this has been a veryinteresting time for me coming back tothe Republican Party walking away fromthe Democratic Party and getting to aplace where people can really tell thetruth the Republican Party is a big tentparty there are a lot of differentopinions and I love that and feel veryat home there I always did if I hadn'tbeen if I hadn't been gay I probablywould never have left the RepublicanParty to be honest and it doesn't throwmy death the Republicans were not opento gay people for a very long time itdoesn't thrill me but I don't judgepeople that what happened ten years agoI don't judge my boyfriends by what theydid ten years ago I'm not going to judgemy political party by what they did tenyears ago what's important now in anydecision whether it be a personalrelationship or a political party for meis what is happening now what ishappening today and I see the RepublicanParty being the party that's reallyprotecting the American peopleand the future of the American peopleand the freedom of the American peopleto say whatever the heck they want theparty of the first amendment is theRepublican Party in my opinion thesedays and freedom of speech is everythingto me it's the most important thing soI'm Pete Holmberg I'm a walk awaycandidateI'm the Republican candidate for NewYork State Senate in district 28 and Iam proud to have walked away and walkedhome to the Republican Party thank youhello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for myself and not the hashtagBrandon so brilliantly came up with Iwould call it the walk back homemovement for myself because I was aRepublican from a very early age Ivolunteered on George HW Bush's primarycampaign in 1980 and then I registeredas a Republican when I turned 18 inChicago and I remained a Republicanuntil I moved to New York when I was 25years old and 1992 and people told mewhen I moved here if you want to berelevant you've got to be a Democrat inthis town and I thought well if I wanderstay irrelevant I would've stayed inChicago so I registered as a Democratand that year I voted for Bill Clintonmy first democratic president that Ivoted for and I remained a Democrat I'llbe it a Democrat who voted for a lot ofRepublicans I voted for Giuliani I votedfor Bloomberg I voted for GovernorPataki I pretty much mixed it up but Ivoted for all Democratic presidentsthrough Secretary Clinton and then onNovember 8th 2016 i sat there and I wasin shock I was in shock and I wasworried I had a lot of reasonduring the campaign I felt to be worriedabout Donald Trump I thought he wouldget us into nuclear war I thought hewould get us into a recession he is doneneither and I'm very pleasantly shockedand surprised by President Trump aspresident and his performance but thenight of November 8th 2016 I did notknow that I would be pleasantlysurprised I was devastated of that nightand I thought I just didn't understandhow it could happen and so I came homeand after President Trump gave hisacceptance speech I did find myselffeeling relieved because there had beena lot of speculation that the resultswould bedid that the election would go onforever I remember what 2000 was likewith bush and gore I did not want torelive that and so I was relieved atleast that the issue was settled it wasa very ugly campaign and I was glad itwas over and I was also in all honestygrateful to live in a country where atleast one person had voted for thepresident so I went on to Facebook about320 in the morning and I effectivelysaid you are my president presidentelect Trump congratulations in yourhard-won victory you have my prayers mysupport god bless americaI meant that I was truly grateful inthat moment to be in to live in ademocratic country and the blowbackpersonally to me kind of offline was wasnasty and it it kind of opened my eyesto the bigotry of the left and I starteddoing research I started reading Iwanted to make sense of why he wonbecause it didn't make sense to me thenight had happened and I talked to a lotof people ended up talking to very smartvery compassionate Trump voters and Iwas kind of reminded of why I had becomea Republican in the first placeit's because I value absolutely freedomof the individual overseas you knowsocial engineering frankly and I'm not abig fan of people sitting in the sentocentralization of power and remote powerI don't I'm not a fan of that never havebeen but I'm gay so when I became aDemocrat it felt natural do 92 and thenwhen gay marriage really when I wasyoung gay marriage was just like it waslike us all of us I mean people talkedabout two men getting married the sameway you would talk about a UFO landingit was the same level of probabilityso when gay marriage really became alegitimate issue when people startedtalking about marriage equality and whenyou know certain states likeMassachusetts and then there was talk ofHawaii at one point I was not going toleave the Democratic Party when theDemocratic Party was the only party eventhough Obama andwere against gay marriage in 2008 if youwere for gay marriage you had to be aDemocrat that's where it was happeningand that's ultimately who made it happenthere's talk that in New York State alot of Republicans just one of the issuegone and so they went to come on saidwell let's get this taken care of and Ibelieve that but let's keep givingcredit where credit is duemarriage equality was a democratic issueand the Democrats helped me to propel italong but that's one issue and there area lot of other issues that factor in intoday's world and after the election ofDonald Trump trying to make sense of theelection of Donald Trump I really gotback in touch with those issues andpeople explain things to me and I did alot of reading I did a lot of reading onmy own and seeing where country is goingthe role that immigration was playinghow people were using immigration and Icame to a lot of conclusions on my ownand it wasn't so much a rejection of aDemocratic Party although I did see alot of dysfunction there that I wasnever comfortable with but I believe inindividual liberty I believe that all ofus were just born with inherent rightsand we need to keep the government frominfringing on those rights governmentdoesn't give us rights were born withthat that's how I really truly believethat and I also believe in diversity ofthought one of the reasons I was drawnback to the Republican Party which Iregistered as a Republican just over ayear ago is that you don't know in theRepublican Party you have to ask someoneare you pro-choice do you pro-lifebecause they're both people there you'vegot to ask on all the issues there'strue diversity of thought and to methat's an incredibly interesting placeto be and it's the most natural place tobe there is no group thank theRepublican Party you do most likely youcan't assume that anyone's coming fromany one place and that's a great thatthat's a

3sIbGLcHLXk,uhtoday i want to talk to you about how iescaped the leftand the crazy radical ideologiesum just a little bit of background aboutmyself i was never a political personum i voted for obama you know just likemostminorities did just because he was blackuh especially living in californialos angeles i mean most of us alwaysjust vote democrat we don't even thinkabout itum but it wasn't until this little covetlockdown situationuh that i really started getting more intune with the topics of what's going onuh in politics and just in general souh island small business the lockdownwas ridiculous to me i noticed thatcostcoand target and walmart all these otherplaces are lettingyou know people come in there with masksthousands and thousands of people everyday can walk through there plus all theemployees touching all these productsbut yet a small mom-and-pop business ormy small businessor hair salon you know doesn't have theopportunity to be openwhen we have one fifth or one-twentieththe amount of foot traffic sothat to me just set off all kind of redflags and i knew that something wasobviously wrongso uh that got meto start doing more research andactually start watching more newschannels and stuff like thatand as i was watching the news cnn msnbci just saw how much they just werebashing on trumpall i heard was this like cryingcomplainingjust talking all this nonsense abouttrump and just angry all the time youknow i didn't see any joyat all i didn't see any answers i justsaw complainingso i would flip back and forth betweencnn msnbcand granite i will

do is they take awaychurch so when i was little ummy parents didn't were not religiousthey were not allowed to go to churchmy grandparents were not allowed to goto church so this was manythis was generations umbut my great-grandparents thatgeneration that wasalmost completely had died off by thattimethey were still allowed to go to churchso when iwas one my great-grandmatook me in to get baptized because thatgeneration was the last generationthat was allowed to go to church andand just think about taking religionawayum i didn't grow up with any religion ididn't grow up with any dogmas anythinglike thatand neither did my parents or mygrandparents soum so that's one thing to think aboutit'sjust not there there's no higher powerthere's nothingtalked about that's that's uh faithor umanything positive that will get youthrough hard situationsit's like hush hush right you there isnotyou just look to the government to tellyou what to think to tell you what to doum you wait in long lines to get yourfoodi remember being so little and my auntshe went and got bananas okay you waitin line there'sone time during the year you can getbananasand you wait in line you get your bag ofbananasand she sat us down me and my cousin andshe saideat the bananas i must have beenprobably three or fourand we sat there and we had to eat allthe bananas before they went badand to this day i hate bananas butthat's the that's that was life you knowthat's how thingswere and um when i was four years oldi remember my parents i walkedpast their room and it was very uhthere was a lot of like tension in theroom my parent my mom was cryingtheir suitcases were packedi think at this time i meanwhat they were going through and iwalked in there and i asked my momi said what's going on where are yougoing and she put me on her lapand she said don't worry we're not goinganywhereeverything's okay and she sent me off tobedthe next day my parents were gone theyescaped now they couldn't tell anyonethey couldn't tell meobviously they couldn't tell anyonewhat was going on um my aunt who was20 years old at the time going through adivorce she was married at 15 she wasgoing through a divorce she wasemotionally unavailable to take care ofme and my cousinso she was there for me but i had myparents were gonethey left are when the government foundout that they had leftbecause it was so dangerous theycouldn't take me with themi mean they would have captured them andput them in political prison andforgotten about them foreverthere was just it was unheard of toescape during that time very few peopleescapedmy dad had a job at aship so he worked on ships where hetraveledto like africa and down themediterranean so hesaw different countries he sawhe saw a glimpse that most did notso that gave him the idea of how toescapebecause he came in with the mission toleave andmove to america one day he literallycame in with that mission he was asystem busterin the system the communist systemcouldn't keep himand so my mom had faith they had faitheven with no religion they had faithand they escaped and i remember duringthat timemy grandma was married to a westerner aczech slovakian man so she wasable to travel to the western worldwestern world she was able to travel toaustria and different places like thatand so she was able to comeand visit me but they wouldn't reallylet herany anymore once my parents escaped mygrandma couldn't come visit meand i remember government agentscoming and patting me on the head when iwas in daycare to make sure that the govthat my parents didn't find a way tosmuggle me that my grandma didn't comeand take me on the train and leave withme to austria like they kept herum they wouldn't let her leave bulgariauntil the government made sure i wasstill in daycarethat was one of the last times shevisited meum so they wouldn't let her leaveuntil they made sure that i was inschool and then they called the stationsaid okay she's okay to leaveso these kind of tactics they had ourphones tappedanytime my parents would call they foundout where my parents arethey would tell them that they're nevergonna see their daughter againthat they're traitors to the country imean just some of the worst thingsthat you can possibly say to someone umand and my parents went through a lotand and theythey escaped because they it was worthit for themthey wanted a better life for themselvesand eventually mei mean they didn't know if they weregoing to see me againmy grandma fought for me she moved toaustriaand was able to go to the the embassythere and theyfought for me my parents had no rightsthey wereimmigrants and refugeesbut my grandma had rights and she foughtwith me for meand eventually two years later they wereable tothey fought for me so much that thecommunist government was notallowed to hold me anymore they had togive me a passport and they waited untilmy parentspassport was about to expire so myparents they knewall the information they knew that myparents had to leave austria to go tocanadaand they waited until the day they leftfor canadato release me so i can beaway from my parents even longer severalmonthsmore like they they did those things onpurposemy grandma when she fought for me theytold her thatonly the communists will keep a childaway fromher parents and that's the way they doitum so finally they were able torelease me i was reunited with mygrandma but thati thought i was gonna be reunited withmy parents i forgot what they look likei forgot who they were i forgot theirvoicesum two years without them so i turnedsix in austriaand had an amazing time with my grandmathereand then um several months later ifinally was reunited with my parentsi flew on a plane by myself from austriato canada and that's where my parentswere and i was finally reunited andall of that all of that was worth itto come to this country we are now inamericaand my dad was able to builda life the american dream for usi have two siblings now and umwe grew up here i grew up in canadaand i from the age of 13 have lived hereinthe united states and he builtone of the largest companies a plumbingcompanyand it was you know he had offices fromcalifornia to floridaand he built that american dream for ushe knew he wanted freedom he knew hewanted to live in a country where youcanbuild and create the life of your dreamsandum that's my storyi i grew up here i never thought i wouldbe so proud to be americani never really looked at all this thethe things that happened and put themall together until nowi came here thinking

trump even gotinand i started paying attention from thatmoment on i startedpaying attention what is going on i knewthe wikileaks i i knewall the stuff i'm intuitive enough toknow abouteverything and where to look forinformation so i knew what was going onwith all of iti had just and then you knowwhen when the information started comingout and when trump startedtalking about the stuff that we all knewbut was hidden for so long i startedpaying attentionand i've never been more involved ormoreum i just learned about politics likelike it'smy job like every day i'm doing homeworkpolitics marxism i

4399xLDEYnA,all right people this is my hashtagwalkaway video and I have never beforebought into any of the hashtag movementbecause it seemed to me like any time ahashtag campaign was launched it wasbecause it was some entitled Millennialsstomping their feet because they didn'tget their way but I figured the hashtagwalkaway movement was something that wasa little different so here's my versionof my walkaway moment now I've beenraised in a credit because I came from apoor white working-class family all mylife I had been taught that it was ademocratic party that represented poorAmerica it was a represent DemocraticParty that represented black America itwas the Democrats that had secured equalrights for black Americans and it wasthe Democratic Party that maintainedthose rights to secure that they stillhad them for black Americans I had beenraised to believe that the DemocraticParty is the party event protected wasthe big brother of small business andthe Democratic Party it was was for theworking class and I had also been taughtto believe that it was those damned OhRepublicans that had been bought out byevery multimillion-dollar corporation inAmerica it was those damned OhRepublicans that sold out to Big Pharmaand let stuff on the shelves thatshouldn't be on there and Americans weretaking pills that they shouldn't betaken and everythingRepublicans were bad Democrats were goodand my walk away moment came andeverything that was running up to the2016 presidential election because priorto that I had never really been heavilyinvolved in politics and the reason wasbecause I was busy with my American lifeI had a full-time job kids law needed tobe mowed London needed to be donesomebody had a dentist appointment youknow all that stuff that comes withbeing American and although I wasn'theavily involved in politics by the timeBarack Obama left office I hadan absolute hatred for socialismliberalism and the progressive movementand those are words that I learned underthe Obama era because I never heardthose words before I wasn't familiarwith them and the reason I hated it sointensely the reason I hate grew to hatesocialism and liberalism so intently isbecause for eight years Barack Obamadictated to me through executive orderbecause he decided to abuse the powerthat he'd been given to write all theseexecutive orders to single-handedlytransform the United States of Americainto this utopia that he'd been taughtall the way back in college and I had tostand there by things like under theObama era it became politically correctfor anybody to identify as any genderthey want to and therefore had the rightto use the restroom that they wanted tonow I live in a flyover State and peoplerun here know that grown-ass men have nobusiness being in the same restroom aswomen and children or that teenage boyshave no business being in the samelocker room as teenage girls but in theObama era that was okay and Obamadictated to me things like you and youand you and you are gonna get a freecellphone and you're gonna help pay forit and then Obama and his administrationdecided that they the federal governmentneeded to sew up the healthcare industrybecause they could do far managed betterat managing it than these private sectorcapitalists and if your monthly premiumshealth insurance premiums jump from 600months to 900 a month sorry about yourluck and then I had to stand there I'mdoing the Obama era why this groupcalled black lives matter sprung up andI would stand there and watch in horrorfor multiple YouTube videos because Iquit relying on mainstream media butduring the presidential election andpeople that lived in these cities whereblack lives matter bro win and thesecities would be destroyed with riots andlooting and fires and busted glass andbus stops that have been torn tosmithereens andsmall businesses that have been takenout and by the time this group rolledout if they admitted they believe thelocal taxpayer footing the bill forseveral million dollars with the damageand the attitude was sorry about yourluck and then Barack Obama decides it'dbe a great idea to invite the leaders tothis group to the White House to givehim a special pat on the back anta boyyou know what I'm sayingand it's like but I didn't see if youwere here view reaching out to thesecommunities that they just destroyedunder Barack Obama era it becamepolitically furet correct for policeofficers just to have somebody walk upto him and sugar in the head kill himsube because they wore uniform and Icould go on and on and on but y'all aregetting the gist of this and so by thetime Barack Obama left office although Ididn't know much about politics I knewthat I absolutely hated socialismliberalism and the

the sunglasses I suffer fromphoto media which is like sensitivity soI have to wear them and I just like theHat anyway I started in politics when Iwas about 15 years old when my cousinDavid took me to a Vietnam War protestshe was you know I was 15 and he was likeyou know you're gonna be 18 soon andthey're gonna want to draft you if thiswar doesn't end and I was like I don'twant to go kill people so I became ananti-war activist you know as much as a15 year old can do and you know but Iwas always a democratic alwaysconsidered myself a Democrat alwaysconsidered myself somewhat progressivebut I was never an ideologue I didn'thate the other side I didn't considerone perfect and one evil or any of thatcrap so I just you know okay I was aDemocrat but the Democrat Party he neverreally really really felt rightthere was something wrong with the wholepicture I saw the education system inNew York City and the and thesegregation and you know all this kindof stuff that just bothered me it's likeif the Democrat Party so great why arethe inner city so crap it didn't makeany sense to me so anyway I just wentalong with it because you know basicallyI was used to it that's what I knew butyou know it really wasn't like I said anideal I wasn't crazy about it but thencame 2016 and what I saw there was justso ridiculousI couldn't make heads or tails of it itjust seemed that the election of DonaldTrump or the eveny before the electionthe campaign's was just so outrageousand ridiculous I'm in New Yorker I knowDonald Trump I mean he's been in thenews here for 20 yearsno one ever called him a racist ormisogynist or a bigot or any of thosethings but now all of a sudden he becameoff overnight bump I mean get pictureswith him with the n-double-a-cp withoutSharpton like hanging out he got anaward now all of a sudden he's a racistcrazy man give me a break okay you lostthat's it you lost get over it but theycouldn't and what I saw coming out ofsin sin was the vitriol and the hatredof not only Donald Trump but anybodythat supported him all of a sudden halfthis country became bigoted racist crazyrural I low IQ uneducated deplorablemorons into the left sidesit just got ridiculous and I

518PseM3uFg,"good evening walk away Canada hi my nameis Stephen this is the first time thatI'll be posting within this group I'mgoing to talk a little bit about Who Iam and what brought me to this point ofjoining the walk away excuse me I feelthat my message needs to be heard andthe reason I do so is because I believethat the majority of us have been liedtowe have been lied to believe that theone side looks out for us more than theother and that's something that I fellfor for many many years of my adult lifeI'm going to tell you a little bit aboutmyself I am a matey Canadian which meansI'm half native and half European not ahappier peon is UkrainianI am also gay so that right there iswhat made me liberal I believe that theLiberalswere going to save me that they weregoing to ensure that my rights as a gaymale were taken care of and as aninterracial male I felt for overidentifying myself based on my race andmy sexuality and lost truth and lostwhat it really meant to be a Canadian sonow I identify myself as simply firstlast and foremost a Canadian I am NOT amatey Canadian I am NOT a gay CanadianI'm a Canadian and that's the thingsthat we need to be willing that's thatone thing that I feel we need to getback to is having some national pridejust simply being proud to be a Canadianbecause to me that's enough we have beenlied for sowe've been lied to for so many years andit was it's just assumed that if you areinto racial and that you are gay you areliberal and I was one of them I was afar lefted individual who was who wereprotesting against any conservativemovement motion anything then I realizedthat I was lied to as were many of uswell woke me up honestly with theAmerican election at the beginning of itI was a Trump hater and I was a Trudeausupporter I voted for adapt for Trudeauunfortunately but the more and more thatI watched Trump and really watched himand did my own research the more andmore I realized the Trump was not aracist a bigoted homophobic ortransphobic he was just simply anAmerican who was sick and tired ofAmericans being kicked around he wastired of seeing his people the Americanpeople being swallowed up by corruptionand that's what we are going throughright now here in Canada we are overidentifying ourselves with things thatin the big scheme of things do notmatter because being Canadian is atstake here the attack on our oilindustry the UN pact and you know whatyou'll learn that conservatives aren'tanti-immigration we are anti illegalimmigration that we are a land of lawsand those laws must be followed and if Ias a Canadian born citizen sorry my noseis itchy and I'm expected to followthose laws than anyone enterour borders or attempting to come intothis country need to do it legally Imyself have been labeled a racisthomophobe which is kind of funny becauseas I've explained to you earlier on inthe videoI am interracial I'm ma T and I'm alsogay so I want that to really sink intoyou when they can live label me a racisthomophobe then realistically no one isoff-limits the labels when someonedisagrees with somebody is anotherreason that I started opening my eyeswatching comments that people wouldcomment on someone who's got more of aconservative viewpoint the type ofcomments that they would leave theinsults the put-downs the threats andthe same great type of racist remarksthat they're coming down onconservatives supposedly for being Iseen more racist comments being postedby left minded liberals than I do byconservatives and I am now proud toannounce that I am a conservative andthat I will make sure and ensure thatour values as Canadians are taken careof across the board my rights as aninterracial gay man do not Trump anyoneelses rights when my rights as anindividual start hindering the rights ofmy fellow Canadians that's when it'sbecoming a problem and what's happeningis we're silencing people and that isnot right we live in a land that issupposed to be free where we prideourselves in freedom of speech sosomeone this simply disagrees withsomething they're entitled to do sowithout worrying about ridiculeput-downs insults threats and yeslabeling this is my Canada as it isyours and it is not only my obligationbut my honor to take a stand for mynation and for all that call it home andthat all who will respect the valuesthat is Canada I came across the walkaway movement because of a few friendsand you know I honestly feel like I wasidentifying as a liberal even though Istill had part of me that didn'tcompletely believe in the in the Liberalsystem in a way because I've alwaysquestioned things but I simply used togo with the grain I used to follow thepact I used to pride myself on thinkingI was a leader when I was a follower butnow I am a lion and you will hear meroar I will no longer stay silent and Iwant no one else to feel they must besilenced because they will be labeledand if they someone does label you letthem I have learned to just acceptthough not everyone is going to agreewith what I have to say and I'm okaywith respectful debate but you can'texpect anyone to listen to you or yourargument when you start insulting andputting them down we are naturallydefensive beings so as soon as someonestarts putting us down insulting us ourwalls of defense go up then there's noway the person you're talking to is evengoing to listen to you we tend to leantoo much on our emotions and less withlogic and that's one thing that kept melost for so long is because I overidentified with my sexuality in my raceI felt like any time I would see a storyor an article on mainstream media or inthe papers and they would make sure thatthey pointed out that the person was gayor interracial or First Nations orwhatever but it angered me they preyedon our emotions and I realize that nowthey preyed on us and they preyed on ourvulnerabilities while I will no longerthan do that I am going to awaken moreCanadians as time goes by this isn't theend of me and nor is my voice ever goingto be silenced the same people anotherthing is another reason I was pushedaway from conservatives was because Iwas told that they would not accept me Iwas made to believe that they werehomophobic racist and bigoted and I'vedone a few videos in in other groups asyou will full of people from all walksof life have a video out there that'sgarnered over 20,000 views mainly ofwhich was viewed by conservative mindedpeople or conservatives and you knowwhat not one comment about my homelessabstract homosexuality and not onecomment about my race all the commentsthere were encouraging uplifting andinspiring these were the same type ofpeople that I was taught to fear that Iwas taught would never accept me and ifI was able to I would show you the manythe dozens upon dozens of inboxes fromconservative Canadians that reached outto me for thanking me for speaking upthanking my bravery telling me that theyaccept me for who I amwhich is Stephen being Stephen is enoughbeing Canadian is enough and anotherthing that liberal minded people pushare the Liberal government's push isthis victim mentality that we are allvictims that I'm a victim because I'mgay because I'm a victim because I'm 80or that I have First Nation ancestry butI'm not a victim I'm not and neitherneither or any of you you can choose tobe a warrior or you can choose to be avictim you can choose to be a leader orI can choose to be a victimwell I don't want to be a victim I amNOT a victim and I won't let anygovernment institution make me feel thatI must be a victim simply because of mysexuality or my race religion or genderwe are be we've gotten so lost andthings that in the big scheme of thingsdo not matter our nation is crumblingour economy has come to a halt we mustrise up Canada come together it realizedthat we were told a big fat lie aboutconservatives and about how we shouldfeel about conservatives or people withconservative values or morals orwhatever and realize that it's time toput the control back in the hands of thepeople us Canadians and hold ourinstitutions the people governing usthat they work for us and not the otherway aroundI love my Canada and I will never stopstanding on guard for thee most of myvideos I end by singing the nationalanthem and I'ma hope you'll you're okaywith that and I sing it the way I wastaught not the reworded one but the oneI was taught so here I go Oh Canada ourhome and native land true patriot lovehe know Larsoncommand with glowing hearts we see theerise the True North strong and free fromfar and wide o

52ZwaP8yTDU,my name is Terry and the reason I walkedaway from Democratic Party back in the90s I voted for Bill Clinton and wemarched on Washington with a quilt wetried to get money for AIDS charitiesand for AIDS research and they shot usdown actually they didn't give us any ofthe money that we needed we started theAtlanta AIDS Walk we did everything thatwe could to get up money and thenHillary Clinton went on TV and said thatmarriage was between a man and a womanhomosexuality was you know a sin soreally left a bad taste in my mouthand that's when I left that party and itwas really funny because you know shewaited 20 years later and then tried tomanipulate my children and yes I havethree children and she tried tomanipulate them into voting for hersaying that she cared about my rightswhen so many of my brothers died of AIDSwaiting for help that they didn't getfrom a party that promised they caredabout us and didn't and didn't give usanything so that's when I left the partyand I find it really funny because ofanybody with a brain does any backgroundcheck they'll see that president Trumpdonated a lot of money to AIDS charityand he helped us in many waysand that's something that they're nottelling in the community that'ssomething that none of my brothers aregetting to hear about but they're alllike they get into a frenzy and theywant to argue with you know like standup to your face and tell you you're anidiot and you're against your own whenthey don't even know the history youknow a lot of these younger ones didn'teven live through it they haven't seenwhat we saw and then there's the olderones thatthink just don't remember or don't wantto rememberyou know they buried it with all of ourdead brothers the three generations ofgay males that died waiting for you knowsomeone to do something for them andthat's when I lost any luster that I hadfor the Democratic community and theirparty and for years I've been trying towake up my brothers and my sisters andnow look what they're doing to what webuilt what we fought to get rights forthey're now bastardizing they'rebringing in all these like anything theycan things that back in the day we saidwould never happen you know we just wantthe same rights as everybody else andnow all of a sudden they're bastardizingwhat we fought for so hard to makehappen and I don't think that people arereally opening their eyes and seeingthat and I pray that my brothers andsisters open their eyes and see thesepeople for what they really are they aretotally for the fall of America and lookat the people that they're putting inwith like our equal rights and and ourmarches and and you know are thesepeople if you look at their backgroundsthey have nothing to do they with whatyou and I are really fighting for itwhat none of us as Americans want asAmericans we all want to love each otherblack white green yellow orange purplewhatever the hell we are we all want torespect each other we all want to helpeach other prosper we we go out of ourway to helpother countries but yet we're nothelping ourselves anymoresomething has to change and I reallythink Trump is that change so andanything that I've said you can go andcheck you can find out its historypeople can't change history the thearticles are there the videos are thereeverything's there look up what Hillarysaid look up when Trump gave us eightmillion dollars so these things you canfind them they're very easy to locateknow your enemyand unfortunately these days our enemyis the Democratic Party they're theenemy of everyone gay straight blackwhite everybody because they want tosegregate us if they separate us make ushate each other they can pick us offeasier but if we all come together theycan't do that that's what they're tryingto do divide separate conquer and Ibabbled on but I just thought I'd get mypoint across and I've lost a lot offriends by saying what I've said to youin my community a lot of people I've hadheated discussions with them and it'svery hard to get someone has thatliberal mindset to hear a fact or evengo look it up and back in my day we wewere liberals with facts you know we weknew what we were doing and these peoplethey're not what we were and I'm gladyou guys are waking up and God bless youand I hope you bring more people to thetruthtake care[Music]
5H-6RvzCYeo,hi my name is Lisa I am a former 45 yearregistered Democrat who has decided towalk away I guess I started having thisrevelation about what was going on withmy party back during the debate timewhen we were trying to pick a candidateto run against the Republican candidateand the DNC decided to force HillaryClinton down our throats whether wewanted her or not and even went to thepoint of cheating I find the party leftme I didn't leave them it's become aparty of extreme left-wing extremistswho are just filled with hate and angerdisrespect lack of compassion lack oftolerance and that's not what theDemocratic Party has represented to mefor the last 45 years I joined the partyright at the tail end of the Vietnam Warit called to me it was to be aninclusive party that was going torepresent all people of all color of allsexuality and it was the party of loveand compassion and tolerance and respectfor the freedom of speech and thosethose things are gone now now it's justname-calling tagging people thatdisagree with you a Nazi you know justsome kind of a bigot a racist just ahorrible name that has been used so manytimes now it doesn't even have an effecton people anymore and it's just identitypolitics and it's pretty disgusting I'membarrassedat the direction of my party's gone itis certainly leaning more towards aSocialist Party now and none of myrepresentatives have done anything totry to stop it and so they no longershare the values that I have and I willbe taking my vote elsewhere I have movedmore into the dependent and we'll bevoting for who I want and I will nothave a party dictating to me and forcinga candidate themthroughout I could never in goodconscience vote for Hillary Clinton andI am not a Russian I've never been toRussia I don't speak Russian I'mcertainly not a robot to the best of myability and I am just absolutelydisgusted that mainstream media istrying to do its best to discredit thismovement the movement now has a hundredand ten thousand people in it that arepretty much like methey're sick of the nasty politics andthey just want to to be more moderateand so they've chosen to walk away anduntil the Democratic Party can dosomething to stop there their votersfrom the kind of behavior that's goingon I think it's gonna continue to tolose members and it's unfortunatebecause I always believe that theDemocratic Party was the pollak party oftolerance and it certainly isn't thankyou

very very grateful for this groupum i grew up in a family i'm in oregonthat um politics weren't a thing when iwas growing upwe went to church uh my parentsum taught sunday school and all thethings and thenum when i was in fifth grade they got adivorceand things just kind of unraveled and umi ended up being the only one going tochurch after that so um i credit a lotofmy life and my my health whether it bespirituallyemotionally all of it to my faith umbecause you know my family is verydysfunctional as arelike many um but as i got olderi definitely um definitelyencountered a lot of i would call itbullyingfrom my family my dad and my sister inparticular for my faithum and i have always beenkind of um people pleaser andtried to keep the peace in my family andjust never spoke up and then as ium went through college i also will haveto say my mom came from aconservative family my dad came from theliberal family and i didn't reallypay attention to that until i got olderumbut um anyway i went throughcollege i have a master's degree and ialways really took pride in notbeing extreme on one end or the otherand just likebeing kind of moderate and seeing thingsfrom both sides i took pride in thatum but as i got even older my dad becamemore extremein his um liberal perspective andyou know very angry i've seena lot of anger from my dad and my sisterand i'm a twin actuallyand um my sister umis a lesbian and you know umi'm 43 trying to think of when shecame out it's probably been like maybe10 years um and ilove everybody i take pride in that ireally do ihave never ever ever ever said a meanthing i don't even feel it you know whywould i say itand um yet i've beeni have been umlabeled and judged for howshe thinks that i believe and then mydad as well in terms of my faithand political beliefs even when he waswrongactually because i haven't always votedrepublican i haven'tand one year when before i have a 14year old before he was bornum so 2004um election time and i wasrenting a room out of my dad's house andum came home and you know my dad umhas a drinking problem and pretty surehe wasum a little bit drunk and high andum he had been on his computer back inthe dial-up daysand was raging madand followed me around the houseveins popping out red in the facetossed me up against the wall and wasthis close to me like spitting in myfaceabout the election and me votingrepublican

you know want toforgive and forgetbut i every time i've done that i'mi paid for it so anyway needless to sayum all the things have really made meum more and more conservative because ofi've just seen the light more and moreum you know i wentto oregon state university and i was inum on a liberal arts track and thenpsychology and my master's is healthpsychology i'm a health coachum and i really started going down amore toxin-freeliving road and um i have mercuryamalgams and i haveum they think possibly ms and i've i'veconnected the dots there because i had alot of amalgams worked oni'm right before my symptoms really hitand it was devastating to meum to my life two years ago umand so i've really reallytaken a root cause approach to my healthever since well a little bit before thatand figuring some things out andnoticing things with my parents andmainstream medicine and that actuallyled meto trump believe it or noti was sad that he was umeven um up for election in 2016 ithought it was horriblebecause i just listened to everybodyelse and the newsbut i also equally hated hillary for myown reasons i meanjust anyway i was never ii didn't want to be political becauseall all the negativelike hateful things from my dad and mysisterum but i i voted for trumpreluctantly lester of two evils and thenum really it's been within the last yearit has really been within the last yearum

5LdnEXgoLAM,hello YouTube this is fly over kami andwelcome to my new channel I wasn't quitesure what video I wanted to have myfirst video be and since the walk awaycampaign is so explosive right now Ithought I would tell my story aboutwalking away so here we go I think thatprobably during Bush juniors years andtrying to get his attention for issuesthat were personally impacting my lifethat that was probably the beginning ofmy eyes opening because no matter what Idid no matter how many letters I wroteto then George Bush jr. it didn't matterI never got a responsenot even a form letter to at leastacknowledge that I had concerns that Ifelt needed to be addressed on behalf ofmyself and millions of Americans so Ikind of disheartened went on to theDemocrat Party and sadly I don't think Ireally knew what the Democrats or theRepublicans were all about I do recallhearing many times that Republicans arefor the rich people and Democrats arefor the people that aren't rich andsince I wasn't a rich person I must be aDemocrat and I'm not really good atfollowing the crowd so I think maybepart of me always spot against being oneparty or the otherI just wanted whoever was in charge tolisten to what I had to say because Iwas gonna vote for somebody and whoeverI was going to vote for needed to besupportive ofthe causes that were important to me andsadly it didn't happen with the DemocratParty or the Republican Party nobodylistened the establishment does notlisten to the little people becausewe're not the establishment it's alldisgusting so I had gone to once I movedon from the Republican Party back in theGeorge Bush jr. days I went on to theDemocrats and I tried to get theattention of John Kerry the attention ofJohn Edwards when they are running forpresident and both of them gave me thesame line when I asked my question tothem in their rallies are their visitsto my community and their answer waswe'll look into it and of course theynever looked into it nobody ever looksinto anything unless you give them lotsof money and it doesn't impact who'scontributing dollars to their campaignso I was pissed off about those two andthen Obama comes along so I wrote Obamamultiple letters never heard anythingand so I did I only voted for Obama onceso the second time around I had a realbig wake-up call or red pill moment orwhatever you'd call it when I was inline at the store because the ladiesbehind me we're talking about who theywere voting for in 2012 and you'll neverguess why they were voting for Obamathey said they were voting for Obamabecause his wife was beautiful are youkidding me does it dumbest thing I everheardwe're voting for the person that's goingto leave the country because their wifeis beautiful I I was dumbfounded so Iwent home and thoughtokay this can't be why people vote forthe president and then I thought tomyself I have no idea why I'm evenvoting for who I'm voting for so I hadto pay attention so I didn't vote forObama I thought maybe I could get theattention of John McCain nope no chancethe only person that I felt at thatpoint that paid any attention to thelittle people with Sarah Palin and theydestroyed her on Saturday Night Live Godand I I think that was when I kind ofstopped watching television I wouldoccasionally watch some programs but Inever watched Saturday Night Live againafter the horrible way they treatedSarah Palin and of course now my god ifthey didn't have President Trump toharass on Saturday Night Live theywouldn't have a show in fact I don'tthink CNN would be alive today or MSNBCor half of the other fake news mediabecause if they didn't have Trump - -they wouldn't have a network should becalled the Trump bashing Network and I'mglad everybody's turning it off Istopped watching the news a long timeago and I stopped watching the newsbecause I was sick of the commercialsdrug commercial galore that's all it isit's like the drug news network you haveto have I don't even think anybody elseI'm sponsors the news every commercialis a drug commercial and I am NOT a fanof the pharmaceutical industry butthat's a really long video we'll getinto another time so when PresidentTrump came down that escalator I thoughtyou know what maybe he's different and Ilistened to what he had to say and heactually talked about some of the thingsthat were important to me so I kind ofstarted to pay attention to him and whenhe came to my town for a rally I got ahold of his campaign staff in my stateand said I really need to get up closeto him because I have to give him aletter it's so important so the peoplefrom his campaign got back in touch withmethey had me meet them at the rally herein my area and they let me in with themand then into the front row so Iactually had a chance to spend like Idon't know it seemed like a really longtime to me but it was probably only liketwo minutes that mr. Trump stoppedI gave him my letter and I gotta ask hima couple questions and instead of a yesand no answer that you would probablyexpect for most people he actually gaveme some answers and then asked mequestions so he kind of had aback-and-forth for a couple minutes thatI don't gather he would remember afterall of the people that he's met acrossthe country but I will never forget itbecause it was the first time in 18years that anybody and the politicalsphere has paid a damn bit of attentionto what I had to say and I was just Ican't even explain how excited I was Ithink I cried the whole time I had myBrittany moment the whole way homebecause I was so shocked that of all thepeople and all the places in all of thecommotion that he had time to talk to meand listen and that's a pretty amazingfeeling to know that while our nowpresident had a moment for me and paidattention to what I had to say so um Idon't think I'm a Republican I don'tthink I'm a Democrat I know I'm not aDemocrat for crying out loudbut I think we're a three-party systemin this country now we have the Looneytune liberals we have the dim or theRepublicans and there's a handful ofgood ones but thenwe have the party of Trump and that iswhere I am so I vote for him in 2020 Ilove our president and I love how he ismaking America great again he's reallygiving the power back to the people andit's such a shame that there's so manypeople in this country that don't knowit yet everything that he's doing isn'tjust for part of the population is forall of us this is America first andthat's not a crime and the stupid fakenews that thinks that America first is acrime those people are nuts it is not acrime to be America first and for theAmerican people when you're thepresident it's not a crime to want yourcountry to succeed or to be great andsafe and successful that's smart butthen again the fake news isn't smarttheir job is to destroy the presidentand I don't know what the hell else theydo but I guess it's really kind of funnyif you do happen across them on YouTubeit's kind of embarrassing I'membarrassed for all of them they'remaking such fools of themselves and I'meven more embarrassed for the peoplethat haven't woke up yet that actuallysit there and believe everything thatCNN and MSNBC says like it's gospel it'sridiculous it is definitely fake newsbut it has been fake news for a verylong time far before the 2016 electionthe 2016 election just kind of made itworse and now they have somebody tocharge it and they have something totalk about even if it's so thatis my walkaway story I walked away along time ago for a long time I justkind of walked around the circlebecause they didn't exactly know where Ibelong but I know that I belong with ourpresidentand I'm so glad so many people arewalking away and we're all comingtogether as Americans and standing upfor what's right and standing up for ourpresident and standing up for the truthso I look forward to talking toeverybody again and thank you so muchfor watching
5pOXa5ZwM8A,my name is AJ I use he him they thempronouns and I made a video last year orso I think for this group and I was justreally nervous and not very confident atthe time I had a lot of anxiety so itwas very short and and I just wanted tomake a longer one that I was morecomfortable with and more confident withso I know last year the admins hadwanted to use the video for somethingand I didn't want them to so this thistime it's it's okay so you guys can usethis however you however you need to butanyway I just wanted to give a littlebit of information about myself and tellyou a little bit about my backgroundhopefully I won't make this too long soI am a member of the LGBTQ community Iidentify as non-binary and demisexualpanromantic all that stuff if you haveany questions about what any of thatmeans you can comment or private messageme that's fine I I grew up in a housethat was democratic until I became ateenager and then they kind of went likemy my parents went the other way toointo far right and I also went far rightand now I'm more independent um forinstance I support the LGBTQ communitybut I'm also pro-life I am very muchanti-abortion I want to secure ourborders I want a flat tax II support the Trump administration inmost of what they do and I I think thatthe states should be able to make a lotmore decisionsthey are currently making I think that alot of things that the federalgovernment currently controls should behandled by the state side really heavilybelieve in the 1st and the 10thamendments of course all of theamendments but I'm often advocating forthose as well as the Second Amendment Iam a legal gun owner I am going pheasanthunting for the first time this Decemberbut I find that I am just an independentand my beliefs and my values kind of aremore on the conservative side but Itreat every individual issue and lookand every individual issue separatelyfrom the collective I guess I don'tlisten to the news anymore I have ananxiety disorder not it's just I get mynews from family and friends and then Igo and research what they've said to meor I get it from this group or my otherconservative groups and that's goodenough for me because the MSM is justnot not doing justice to actual news somy point in introducing myself is to saythat I am not the typical Trumpsupporter I ambiologically female I identify on youknow the non-binary scale I am part ofthe LGBTQ community and by every rule Iguess imposed on me by society I shouldnot be a fan of President Trump and I amand I'm really proud of Mike Pence and Iam in Indiana I think that he was a verygood governor our our state did veryvery well under him and I think he'sbeen a very good vice president I'msuper proud of him and I like thetrumpetstation and I'm I should be a Democratby every stretch of the imagination andI'm not because I read I'm sorry thatwas a little salty um no but I I look ateach individual issue and I I divedeeply into it I don't just trustheadlines I don't just trust what peoplesay I don't listen to hearsay I look forthe truth and the truth has led me towalk away from liberalism and and theDemocratic Party maybe if it was thesame Democratic Party that it was backin the eighties or somethingI would be more inclined to be part ofit but as it stands right now so that'smy story and if the admins or somethingwants to use this in whatever projectthey can if you have any questions aboutanything that I believe or stand for oridentify as or whatever um you guys cancomment or private message me that lasttime I made one of these posts I got somany comments and messages that myFacebook app crashed multiple times in aday so I I just really like to have thatdialogue going though and I know that alot of people have a lot of questionswhen they realize that I am what shouldbe stereotypically Democratic and I'mnot I'm also a Christian I used to be awitch when I was teenager ish and nowI'm a Christian and I still identify astrans non-binary and all that stuff andand a lot of people sometimes havequestions about that too so if you haveany questions if you want to know anyinformation just let me know just pleasebe respectful and I'll be respectfulback so I think that our world hasforgotten how to be compassionate andthink that compassion is somethingthat's desperately needed nowadays so Ido my best it's not in my nature um butI do my best to answer with compassionand the truth and try to word myopinions to the best of my ability sothat other people can understand mythought process so yeah just let me knowthanks for listening and I'm I've been apart of the walk away group since Julyof last year I think something like thatit's been a while and I love seeing allyour stories so thanks so much forlistening to me and catch on the footsideyou

heavy-dutyDemocrats they believed you have to lookat each candidate to decide who it isyou want to vote for and they alwaysvoted a straight Democratic line which Idid too for a while until I decided

moneysupporting campaigning Democrat had someproblems with the Democratic Partybecause I'm also I was born and raisedCatholic my folks are heavy-dutyDemocrats they believed you have to lookat each candidate to decide who it isyou want to vote for and they alwaysvoted a straight Democratic line which Idid too for a while until I decided Icouldn't follow some of the Democraticbeliefs because of the fact that I'm aChristian and I'll just put it out therethe one that took me away was the factthat I am pro-life and the Democrats arenot that was the straw that broke thecamel's back way back when then whenBill Clinton was elected as president Ihad a friend who had been elected toCongress great manhe went to school Oh a few years aheadof me he was a lawyer and I worked hiscampaign even though he was a Democratand I was not anymore I really believedin the man he won he went to DC and hewas there for two years when he cameback home on their first leave he madeit known to all of us that as soon ashis term was up he was done and I askedhim I said Jim why and he's doneWashington DC is unlike any place hesaid you go in you're immediately toldwhat you can and can't do how are youwere going to vote who you're going totalk to you and then you have peoplecome in who talk to you for five minutesand leave basically a pile of money onyour desk and say just make sure you getthis debt okay and he said I called manyof them and told them no you're I don'ttake bribes take the money and go and hesaid I went to votes and I went toparties and I did things with everybodyelse and quickly found out that dice youwere living back home and in a modestforty fifty sixty thousand dollar housewe're now selling their houses andbuying a million dollar houses on theother side of the county and not evensticking with their constituents whovoted him in because there's so muchmoney from so many different places andhe said if I say there I'll lose my soulthe founding fathers told us if we wentto a two-party system the country wouldnot last they warned us and you can readthis it's it's in their own hands butthey they told us that the parties willbecome corrupt the money will be toomuch the power

5ZAiP9b6_5g,this is my walkaway video I think it'sbest I give you a little bit ofbackground about how I was brought upand raised I was born in 1977 and southsuburban Chicago Cook County and Iwasn't really born to a political familyat least that I can remember I was bornand raised I can't say born I was raisedin a Southern Baptist Church and CountyMississippi Illinois and I went tochurch every Sunday with my family andin 1983 my dad had lost his job or gotlaid off at Republic Steel and he joinedthe military US Army at 31 years old hewas about five years old five or six andso he left you know and pretty much fromthat point on I didn't have a father inmy house so let me tell you fromexperience I believe truly believewholeheartedly that that was my downfallas a kid you know and the direction mylife was gonna go for the next 20 22years was obviously because of mychoices but I didn't have a man in thehouse to really beat my assyou know figuratively speaking literallywhatever rightso I ran all over my mom I did I was arebel and I was counting down the daysuntil I turned 16 just so I could dropout of high school I absolutely hatedschoolI I didn't really hate to learn it'sjust I hate it schoolso I'd say within three years of medropping out of high school I was in Ilanded myself in prison I was a drugdeal that went bad I got shot threetimes I shot that guy twice and I got a9 year prison sentence I'm not blaminganybody but me because I actually knowwhat personal responsibility is so itwas all my fault it was my doing butpart I played in it and I played majorroles in my life I'm the creator of mylife I like to think anyway soeverything that's ever happened to megood or bad I had to say that I played apart in it you know it was either my baddecision my poor decision-making ormaybe I made some good decisions youknow along the way so from there and bythe way I've always been a drug addict Imean of course not in the past 12 yearsbut the majority of my life I've been adrug addict from smoking weed the firsttime in 11 or 12 years old shootingheroin shooting methamphetamines smokingcrack doing lines of cocaine whateveryou name it I pretty much did it and sowhen I got out of prison I decided totry heroin for the first time I don'tknow why I decided that probably becauseI'm an addict mentally in the head and Ihave an addictive personality orwhatever right so I'll tell you what Idid here one for six months when I gotout of prison and in that six months Ilost every piece of anything that I everhadproperty material things self-worthself-esteem everything rightso I ran man I ran from an addictionthat at the time I had no idea rightthat no matter where I went I alwaystook meet with me so I can run anywhereand everywhere possible but I can'toutrun myself well that's all I did Ijumped on the Greyhound in 2005 Januaryand took it to Southern California Iwent out I went out there to sellmagazines door-to-door write travel thecountry that's all the end the paper Icalled it and they they paid for my busticket down there and I was now all of asudden I was in the magazine crew thatlasted like a few days I couldn't knockon doors like that I didn't feel rightabout knocking on doors I didn't feelright about lying to people's faces andtelling them this big spiel about justwhatever just sticking by some [ __ ]magazines from okay so I quit but then Iwas in a situation because I quit I wasstuck in California and I'm fromIllinois I didn't know anybody out thereand I had no money so you can imaginewhy I have a dentist right well Ithought myself hopeless and I was inAnaheim the city of Orange Santaon the Santa Ana River bed and it was ahomeless community on there still is ahomeless community out thereits massive actually on that river bedit was pretty big when I was out theretoo but when I went back out there in2016 and it's it's just it's massive nowthere's so many more homeless people outthere and there's so many so anyways Istayed on that River been homeless forabout a year and a half two years andwhat got me to change my life aroundwhat got me to get clean and cleanmyself up was guilt and no not whiteguilt uh I had two kids out there I hada boy and a girland this was in 2006 and both of theirmothers were homeless women as well andI just could not take the guilt mydaughterdefinitely she was born first and thenseven days later my son was born but theway my son was born he was born at 20weeks gestation he was 1 pound 10 ouncespositive for methamphetamines and Iplayed a role in that I played a majorrole in that I couldn't take it it wasat that moment that I realized that Iwas the most selfish self-centered manor sorry excuse for a man that I've everknown you know it was a day of reckoningfor meI couldn't take it man I could not takethe guilt just couldn't getting explainthe amount of guilt how heavy it wasright now I can't explain it with wordwith mere words so I came back home andcleaned myself up you know and sincethen in 2007 I I landed a pretty goodjob you know I'm in the Union now andthis and that so uh so why I'm walkingaway I said well I'm walking away rightI'm in the Union and the first time Igot a letter from the Union suggestingon who I vote for I was happy you know Iwas just happy to be a part of societyand in my head I haven't lived insociety at least any kind of aproductive member of society I haven'tso I was just happy to do it for himyou know they negotiate my wages theygive me the health insurance I'm gonnavote for who you want me to vote noproblem right and I did I voted forBarack Obama without knowing a thingabout them I was black and I wanted thatactually I wanted the direction of ourcountry to go that way you know and Ididn't really check anything else aboutthemI just that's what I wanted so andthat's what I got the man ran on aplatform of change and we got that so Ican't complain about that so the reasonI'm walking away and I this time I'mwalking away from the Democrat Party whoknows a four year or six years 20 22yearsain't no way year is right so in twoyears I might vote for or I willprobably vote for Tom in 2020 and afterthat I don't know who all before I don'teven know the state of our country bythat who really knows because it'sgetting crazy guys it's getting realcrazy it's been crazy it's just now allon the surface now it's been like that Ican promise you that and I know for afact it's been like that it's just allbeen subtle and underneath you know andbut my head is crazy this is not theUnited States that I grew up in this isnot the United States and I want mychildren to grow up in and that's thereason I will never blow the boat blueagain I got kids man I've got I've gotnot just the two I've got three otherkidsand currently my kids range in age from3 to 12 and I care about them so Ireally don't care who the Union tells meto vote for I don't care who's whosehands and whose pockets I'm doing it formy kids I'm doing it for my familybecause it starts at my house with mykids but let me tell you a little bit alittle story though my daughter that wasborn in 2006 in California Orange CountyI ended up getting getting custody ofher last year in December of 2017 I'llnever forget when she first came I'vebeen like from let me just say this I'veliked home for a while I didn't reallyknow too much about him but I just knowyou know I liked him I mean he is likethe American dream and I don't reallycare if he started off borrowing like amillion dollars from his dad the man hasbillions right now of his own moneyyou know I know for a fact I can't dothat and if any of you guys can do itmore power to you right so anyway mydaughter I got custody of her lastDecember she's been with me about 11months now and when she came in I thinkTrump was on the news or something likethat and she goes like this goes I hateTrump and then she was all for Hillaryright and so I'm like why why do youmean Trump who told you thatlike why exactly do you hate him and whyexactly do you hate Hillary well thetime she was 11 and I really didn'texpect her to know an answer butnonetheless I'm doing this to prove apoint or right so fast forward to lastSaturday a week ago yeah week ago todayTrump was in Murfreesboro Illinois Ididn't give my daughter a choice I tookher well I took her in my family and Itook her for a reason and she was intoit you know she was clapping like ohyeah and so after the rally I asked herI said what do you think what do youthinkoh all that was good it was good I saidokay did you hear anything racist bychance coming out of his mouth no that'swhat she said right my eye well thatshould tell you something right don'tbelieve everything you hearnow I don't really care who my daughtervotes for when she gets of age you knowas long as she makes her own decisionsthat's it as long as she hears thingswith her own ears and makes her owndecisions and not based on whateverybody's saying right because that'sthe problem with this country with a lotof people in this country and it mayhave been my problem - it may be myproblem I really don't know sometimesit's hard to see when you're on theinside I'm just I'm upset you know I Idon't want our country to go the wayit's going I certainly do not wantglobalism at all I don't want openborders and I'm not sure if these guysthink that they're more enlightened thanus the the mere peasants we are hope Ireally don't know but I'm not ready toget my country up like that I am NOTready to give my country go so go fightfor I mean there's more than one way tofight right you fight with your mouthyou can fight physically a lot of peopleare fighting on the internet whateverbut I will fight for my country and Iwill fight for what I believe is rightI'll fight for my kids fight for myfriends I'll fight for my familyI'll fight for the truth I'll fight forwhat's right open borders is it right inmy head from my point of view openborders is not right okay we got enoughcriminals over here and trust me I donot believe that that whole Caravan isall criminals I don't believe that but Idon't believe they're all women andchildren either I don't believe they'reall just people looking for work see Igot common sense man I know these peoplegot common sense too so I don't evenknow why they're trying to lie to peoplethey're trying to lie to us knowing thatwe know they're lying and I don't get itI don't get it who knows manbut I I know this for a fact and I knowthis from dealing with people in thepast my own experience there thesepeople are on a code of silence man theywill not come clean period I promise youthey won't they won't talk about [ __ ]they won't talk about it I know theywon't code of silence man I don't knowif you guys get that butI mean what we consider colder silencetrust me what they got going is a codeof silence they won't talk about [ __ ]they won't you might get one peep out ofsomebody but they're gonna pay for soanyways that's my walkaway story I meanit's not really a walkaway story I guessit's more about personal responsibilityit's about whatever all I know is thiscountry's messed up and I am voting allred oh this midterm for one reason andone reason only it's not for the GOPit's not for the Republicans I do thinkI have conservative values and let metell you one other thing about that tooright because the the side of the leftfor me they do have a persuasiveargument I mean they do pull itheartstrings right I mean I watch CNNsometimes not because I you knowwhatever I want to hear what they'retalking about I'm tired of hearing soundbites right I need to know what they'retalking about and they do pull up myfreaking heartstrings man of course manI want to help people I do want to helppeople that they're in pain or having arough time I think it's in my nature forthem for the most part and so when I'mconfused when the waters are muddy Ialways go back to one thing man I goback to principles principles will guideme the right direction when I'm confusedabout things or where my heart stringsare being pulled I'm against abortionthere's one principle I'm pro-lifeand just because and I've been involvedin two abortions in my younger years andhave since repented I stand firm onpro-life now and it's not just because Ihad a vasectomy right I extended

6CHoRUDE5uM,hello everyone my name is Thomas Davisand I live in the North GeorgiaMountains as you can kind of see thereflection in our back deck windows it'sa nice woodsy area and I'm just enjoyinga nice August afternoon while I'msitting here I was thinking about why Iwalked away from the Democratic Party sohere's my story my mom and dad wereRepublicans but they raised me to votemy conscience and oftentimes we wouldvote Democrat sometimes we disagree Ivoted for Carter but I also voted forNixon I voted for Reagan but I alsovoted for Clinton and Obama both twicewhat changed me into a Democratbasically was the invasion of Iraq Ireally thought that was unnecessary andI blamed george w bush for all thoselives lost and money spent so I switchedto the Democratic Party thinking thattheir ideals were better now I've alwaysbeen a supporter of the Second Amendmenteven when I was a flaming liberal andI've always been conservative on somethings but for the most part Itook all the liberal policies to heartand when the 2016 election came around Iwas definitely a Bernie bro I neverliked Hillary I never liked her when shewas a first lady I didn't have a lot offaith in their truth-telling abilitiesbut at the time I didn't really carewhether Clinton had an affair or notbecause the country was in good shapefinancially I have since changed on thatI am really really upset about the factthat I ever voted for him or Obama theObama was such a disappointment to mebut getting back to why I walked awayfrom the Democratic Party in 2016 like Isaid I was a Bernie bro I was all aboutthe free college the free health carethe flee this the free that and I hadslowly been indoctrinated or let's saybrainwashed into believing that all theills of the earth or because of the richso when the DNC and Hillary basicallygave Bernie the screw job that they didmy eyes began to open now I might alsohave mentioned that I had moved fromFlorida which is a liberal haven to theNorth Georgia Mountains in 2012 so I hadplenty of conservative friends and Ifought with them often about my idealsversus their ideals they were alwaysalways respectful kindand treated me as a human even though myviews were radically different fromtheir conservative years now I can't saythat about my liberal friends because Ihad several on Facebook and even inpersonal life when my beliefs began toevolve and when it finally culminatedwith meswitching allegiances from Democratic toRepublican or liberal to conservative Ilost no less than 15 friends why becausethey're intolerantthey are unable to see another point ofview they are mean they said horriblethings to me they are angry they areeight full will you restate that theyare hateful I never had one conservativefriend ever unfriend me or treat me withdisrespect because I believed and allthe birdy bro bull or the Obama bull butthe Liberals dude oh they jumped on mewith both jackboots so in 2016 I votedfor President Donald J Trump I have toadmit that at first it was because I wasjust pissedabout the way the Democratic Partyoperated but I also like the things thathe was saying I didn't believe that itwas going to be possible or that he wasgoing to do the things that he said hewas going to do because most politiciansin my experience have not but he did hehas tried or fulfilled every singlepromise that he made to us on thecampaign trail and we are reaping therewards reaping the rewards so here's mywalkaway moment it happened in 2016 butI'm just telling you about it now in2018 I am so pleased to see there peopleother than myself are waking up to theliberal lies and the harassment they'rethe left puts forthSogo Trump vote conservative and Iwalked away Thomas Davis from the NorthGeorgia Mountainsyou
6q8I9CpV-S0,my name is Michael and I want to thankmy wife for encouraging me to make thisvideo you may have heard of her videolast nighther name's Libby and I really want tothank Brandon for what he did by givingher an opportunity to speak to a largeraudience so I think for me I actuallywalked away long before I even knewthat's what I was doing it probablystarted long back when I started gettingheavily involved with documentaries andstarting to understand how corrupt biggovernment was and how it made a lotmore sense for government to be smallerat the time I thought the solution tothat was Democrats and I was sillyenough to vote for Obama twice honestlynot knowing much about policy butthinking it made sense to give everybodyhealthcare and I've certainly been forexample pro-choice my entire life I'dstill tell you I am but I certainlyunderstand why states want to have muchstricter pro-life laws and I do thinkthere's a lot of hypocrisy out thereespecially with maybe let's say thecurrent immigration system with peoplethat are also ok with babies dying maybea week or two before they could be bornor actually maybe even after they couldpotentially be born and live so there'sthat but now yeah I mean I I take time Iresearch pretty much everything I lookat both sides it's pretty funny the hateand the vitriol that I receive I do notattack people I do not even attackreally what people say I do my best tothink about maybe their perspective Ithink Jordan Peterson's 12 rules is afantastic book and I think you got toget your own house in order first and Ithink I have to take the time tounderstand somebody else's perspectiveand make sure I'm not attacking somebodyelse if what I'm asking for is theDemocrats and liberals not to beattacking us but I will say as much as Idisagree with let's say for example aguy like Sam Harris on his his opinionwith Trump he clearly has a pretty goodidea ofhow bad the left is as compared to theright when it comes to individualfreedoms and that's really probably themost important thing to meso I mean there's so much to talk aboutand my wife can tell you I can prettymuch talk forever but I at least wantedto share a little bit of my story I'mnot even sure if I'm really aconservative I think reading a lot ofdiscussion on Libby's post and onBrandon's post last night maybe I'm anold school liberal who's actually acenter-right conservative nowadays Imean I'm certainly not religiousalthough having two children now Ialmost would like to find religion Igrew up Jewish but I was heavilycriticized by people and a very heavilyJewish City which is kind of strange butyeah so I really hate bigotry andthere's so many people in my family thatliterally are being bigots and don'tunderstand that that's what they'rebeing and then are upset for beingcalled bigots although I'm no longercalling anybody bigots this was probablysix months ago when I was unfriended bymy cousin and my uncle which is kind ofhurtful I can't believe itmy uncle is one of the most freethinkers I thought he was at least andit's hard for me to understand why hewould have unfriended me just because Iwas posting factual articles on one ofhis posts and he insisted that it wasnot factual so that's my story and Ihope more people do post videos III seemore of a red wave than a blue wave inupcoming political elections which willhopefully continue our country on a muchgreater trajectory so I would say leaveyou with one last thought we should allagree that it would make a lot of senseto make America great againmy

76Mj6tMNiBw,so my kids said hey mom can you at leastbrush your hair and put some makeup onif you're gonna make a video for a bunchof strangers and I thought no I'mkeeping it real they're gonna get toknow me really well right now so I mightas well show them what I look like rightso walking away walking away from me hasbeen an increment it's been baby stepsit's been evolutionary and I didn't justwalk away I walked away a while ago justto give you some background I am alatina born and raised in the boogiedown bronx my dad's boricua Puerto Ricanand my mom is a legal resident a legalimmigrant from Belize and between her mydad I think they raised for prettyamazing children my brothers are bothUnited States Marine Corps veterans andthey both served in Desert Storm mysister's an accountant and she is a 9/11survivor she worked on the 90 floor ofthe first tower that got hit and Isurvived running the streets in theBronx so I guess my first bigdisagreement when my dad was when Iturned 18 this was a while ago I'm 43years old and so the first presidentthat I ever voted for was Bill Clintonand my dad schooled me he did he saidthat I was being brainwashed by themedia and that I was allowing myself tovote for someone who was no good butjust because he was young and hip and Idenied it I denied it to the core but umhe was rightyou know I saw Bill Clinton on MTV andhe had smoked but didn't inhale so Ithought that was pretty cool what ashallow reason to vote for someone rightso anyhow let me give you somebackground on my parents they're bothpretty conservative Christians but Ibelieve that they're beautifulChristians they're what Christianityshould be I vote in the 90s and I hadtransvestites come to my house withtheir big shoes and a big hair and theirpsychedelic clothes because the lightwas groove is in the heart was aand you know my parents have come in theroom do you guys need anything those aremy parents my sister's best friend was agame man during the 1980s and he hadAIDS and his family did not want him itwas taboo to be a gay man in the 80sdying of AIDS but my parents took him inand he died in my home and those are thepeople who raised mebeautiful conservative people with a bigopen heart but even with that solidfoundationI let the osmosis of New York City seepinto me and mold my thinking you knowand I thank God for my parents because Ithink it is that true foundation thatallowed me to seek truth and finally getto where I'm at I turn back to my rootsbut in the middle of all that I livedthe liberal life I worked in the musicindustry I was the manager of the firsthip-hop label label on fever records andfever nightclub and I lived a prettyliberal lifestyle and a lot of mychoices were liberal and you know it wasone of those knuckleheads that thought Iwould never personally have an abortionbut it's okay if you do and and just ahit just supported Planned Parenthood andjust uh just a totally different personthan Who I am so they 43 year old motherfive beautiful children conservativeliving in a different state in thesuburbs and seeing things completelydifferent I guess I started walking awaywhen one of my brothers was diagnosedwith Gulf War Syndrome and he got itfrom the inoculations that he receivedin the Marine Corps it made me startresearching and I realized that thepresident who I voted in Bill Clintonsigned theexecutive order 131 39 the basic Drenders a militaryguinea-pigs the governments allow to dowhatever they want without informedconsent on our military and it's okaybecause of that executive order and sothat was my first mm-hmm and then mysecond son was injured by the MMRvaccine he swelled three times the sizehe got his first asthma attack and hebroke out in a rash from head to toe andwas inconsolable but because a militarydoctor told me that it could never bethe vaccines and I was so trusting ofgovernmental officials that I believedhim and I continued to vaccinate mychildren and my son was injured a secondtime and this time it was undeniable hehad an anaphylactic reaction to the MMRvaccine and he stopped breathing andthat really opened my eyes and it tookme through a rabbit hole where theending is basically hell and then 9/11happened and my sister survived but itmade me really question things becauseour world was changing Homeland Securitywas started the airport was like goingthrough Rikers Islandyou know prison it was just awful andeven early on some people wouldwhispering and saying that it might bean inside job and I didn't believe thatbut three years later someone handed mea VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jonesand this nutjob made a lot of sense andplanted some seeds and so I walked awaya little more slowly I started toquestion things and I think that at thatpoint I registered myself as aRepublican but guess whatmy research took me so far down therabbit hole that I then decided to goparty less and decided to just votepeople on merit andI kept switching back and forth betweenboth parties depending on who I thoughtI wanted to vote in and even then eventhen that I thought I was awake I reallywasn't guys really really wasn't it'sbeen evolutionary and it's been a lot ofresearch and a lot of opening andexpanding of my mind and the reason whyI explained to you my background isbecause I think it took the sort of homethat I grew up in where everyone waswelcome teen moms were pregnant you knowblack white Chinese has mine you knowDominican I mean it was a melting pot inmy parents home they took in the peoplewho were unwanted by some and raisechildren who were

Iturned 18 this was a while ago I'm 43years old and so the first presidentthat I ever voted for was Bill Clintonand my dad schooled me he did he saidthat I was being brainwashed by themedia and that I was allowing myself tovote for someone who was no good butjust because he was young and hip and Idenied it I denied it to the core but umhe was rightyou know I saw Bill Clinton on MTV andhe had smoked but didn't inhale so Ithought that was pretty cool what ashallow reason to vote for someone rightso anyhow let me give you somebackground on my parents they're bothpretty conservative Christians but Ibelieve that they're beautifulChristians they're what Christianityshould be I vote in the 90s and I hadtransvestites come to my house withtheir big shoes and a big hair and theirpsychedelic clothes because the lightwas groove is in the heart was aand you know my parents have come in theroom do you guys need anything those aremy parents my sister's best friend was agame man during the 1980s and he hadAIDS and his family did not want him itwas taboo to be a gay man in the 80sdying of AIDS but my parents took him inand he died in my home and those are thepeople who raised mebeautiful conservative people with a bigopen heart but even with that solidfoundationI let the osmosis of New York City seepinto me and mold my thinking you knowand I thank God for my parents because Ithink it is that true foundation thatallowed me to seek truth and finally getto where I'm at I turn back to my rootsbut in the middle of all that I livedthe liberal life I worked in the musicindustry I was the manager of the firsthip-hop label label on fever records andfever nightclub and I lived a prettyliberal lifestyle and a lot of mychoices were liberal and you know it wasone of those knuckleheads that thought Iwould never personally have an abortionbut it's okay if you do and and just ahit just supported Planned Parenthood andjust uh just a totally different personthan Who I am so they 43 year old motherfive beautiful children conservativeliving in a different state in thesuburbs and seeing things completelydifferent I guess I started walking awaywhen one of my brothers was diagnosedwith Gulf War Syndrome and he got itfrom the inoculations that he receivedin the Marine Corps it made me startresearching and I realized that thepresident who I voted in Bill Clintonsigned theexecutive order 131 39 the basic Drenders a militaryguinea-pigs the governments allow to dowhatever they want without informedconsent on our military and it's okaybecause of that executive order and sothat was my first mm-hmm and then mysecond son was injured by the MMRvaccine he swelled three times the sizehe got his first asthma attack and hebroke out in a rash from head to toe andwas inconsolable but because a militarydoctor told me that it could never bethe vaccines and I was so trusting ofgovernmental officials that I believedhim and I continued to vaccinate mychildren and my son was injured a secondtime and this time it was undeniable hehad an anaphylactic reaction to the MMRvaccine and he stopped breathing andthat really opened my eyes and it tookme through a rabbit hole where theending is basically hell and then 9/11happened and my sister survived but itmade me really question things becauseour world was changing Homeland Securitywas started the airport was like goingthrough Rikers Islandyou know prison it was just awful andeven early on some people wouldwhispering and saying that it might bean inside job and I didn't believe thatbut three years later someone handed mea VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jonesand this nutjob made a lot of sense andplanted some seeds and so I walked awaya little more slowly I started toquestion things and I think that at thatpoint I registered myself as aRepublican but guess whatmy research took me so far down therabbit hole that I then decided to goparty less and decided to just votepeople on merit andI kept switching back and forth betweenboth parties depending on who I thoughtI wanted to vote in and even then eventhen that I thought I was awake I reallywasn't guys really really wasn't it'sbeen evolutionary and it's been a lot ofresearch and a lot of opening andexpanding of my mind and the reason whyI explained to you my background isbecause I think it took the sort of homethat I grew up in where everyone waswelcome teen moms were pregnant you knowblack white Chinese has mine you knowDominican I mean it was a melting pot inmy parents home they took in the peoplewho were unwanted by some and raisechildren who were abandoned by theparents I think it took this sort ofbackground to keep me open-minded and tomake me research and really startquestioning things because I realizedthat the media was playing us thateverything was connected the presidentthe agendas you know my son's injury mybrother's injury researching health andvaccines and and seeing that some stateshave made it mandatory for children tobe vaccinated in order to go to schoolif something is so good for you why doyou have to mandate it and I don't wantto start a debate here I'm all aboutchoice I'm all about informing peopleand giving them choice and the thing isthat no one informed me when I was ayoung mom even when I questioned that ittold me it was safe and effective and Iguess all those things health thepharmaceutical industry the politicscelebrities because being coming from aworld where I worked in a world ofcelebrities hip-hop singers and then Iswitched over to the Latin scene and Iknow I'm not gonna mention it but Iworked for some really big Latin artistsha's and I got to see that world too andin my research I realized that it's allconnected the leads the Cabal CPSvaccines pharmaceuticals money greed Imean it's a big rabbit hole and thething isSociety you know we're normal workingpeople a lot of us you know I'm blessedto be a stay-at-home mom my you know myhusband works and we have a beautifulhome and I get to stay home with ourchildren we sacrificed a lot so I don'twant anyone to think that I'm privilegedI've been called a privileged whiteperson when I'm not white second I'm notprivileged my husband and I have bustedour behind so everything that we haveand we sacrifice a lot but I lost mytrain of thought but my thought I thinkI was going with a lot of people um Ohdivisionthe media tries to play us and divide usand people who meet me now and see me asa conservative Christian stay home momhomeschooling mama five theyautomatically assume things about methey think that I'm hateful that I'mhomophobic that I was born with a silverspoon in my mouthyou know it's so ridiculous and knowingmy roots knowing that I was born andraised in the Bronx by two hard-workingpeople knowing the type of home that Icame from it kind of pisses me off thatpeople assume that I'm privileged but Iguess what I want people to take awayfrom this is that the first step sowalking away is educating yourselfwhatever it took to open your eyes tapin on that and delve into other realmsbecause you will see that it's allconnected and a lot of what we've beentold are lies a lot of it I have abackground in the medical industry I'm alactation consultant I worked for theHealth Department I went to nursingschool and what I realized is that BigPharma has their dirty little hands anda lot of things in textbooks and whatwe're taught they support wings andhospitals if there's money there's apossibility of getting in there this ishow formula companies were able to gettheir formulas into goodie bags that arehanded out to new parents everythingeverything has a purpose everything isdonefor a purpose and I guess but I wantpeople to take away from this is that ifa kid from the Bronx who grew up and wasraised in the ghetto can get out canopen and expand her mind and can seethings for what they really are so canyou so can youwe can all do it and we don't have tolove each other's choices and we don'thave to agree on everything but we canlove one another as human beings and wecould come to common ground and we couldwork together to bring a beautiful andbrighter future for all that's the thingwe don't have to be divided just becauseI voted for Trump doesn't mean that Iagree with everything he says I don'tfollow anyone blind me just because Ivoted for Trump doesn't mean that I'mprivileged just because I'm a Christiandoesn't mean I'm homophobic um I havegay cousins who I loveI grew up voguing and I had I grew upwith a gay man living in my home youknow like just because we are certainthings doesn't define the whole of us asa person so I guess my video is that wecan all come from different walksdifferent views and still walk away andstill hold our hands together and stillfight for good if a good country godbless my children follow me

7OGv5BD9854,hi everybody I'm a little nervous soplease bear with me as I sort of stumblestumble my way through this story I'venever told this story in public so youguys are the first to hear the story nowmost of my friends now who know me herein 2018 it's pretty public knowledgethat I am a socially conservativeeconomic libertarian who supports themilitary but doesn't want to donation-building I guess that's where Iam politically I am not registered inany party I have never campaigned forany candidate very politically activeand informed but registered independentthat's kind of where I am and for myfriends who know me in this way most ofthem have no idea how radical and wackyI was as a young adult and I guess Iwanted to talk about how young peopleget sucked into really radical ideologyand what shook me out of it so for me mystory it began for me basically in mychildhood because I grew up in veryextreme poverty my parents were prettymuch the epitome of white trash and I'mnot saying that in a condemning kind ofway at all they they know this they weredoing the best they couldit just was what it was but we were inpretty extreme poverty and for me as achild living in that world I was bulliedquite a bit I really didn't have anyfriends and judging from the grown-upsin my family I didn't have a whole lotto look forward to so I wanted somethingbetter and I was searching for kind of away to get out of that ditchand when you live in that environmentthe only political social option thereis is the Democrat Party when I wasyoung it was made clear to me in nouncertain terms the Republican Party isa private club for millionaires and theymade their fortune by unscrupulous meansjust period we didn't know anyRepublicans never met a millionaire inour life but we were quite sure that allof them were unscrupulous and they hadtheir own private club so for me to getinvolved in any kind of social justiceor whatever I was nudged to the left bydefault so you kind of you start downthis road wanting happiness love andfairness and for everybody to be happyand having a food that that's why youstart down the road but somewhere in theprocess it starts getting ugly andusually what happens is you beginwanting tolerance wanting inclusion butall of a sudden as you go you startlooking for excuses to disqualify peopleand that's always step one and it'snever anything personal it's alwaysabout a philosophy or a policy or asocial demographic that's what it iseverything is cast in terms of abstractdemographics institutions it's neverpersonal it's always demographic so youstart off down this road and you startdisqualifying well why should I botherdefending millionaires millionaireRepublicans what do they need me for andthat's the little sleight of hand I'mdefending the little guy what do theyneed my help for they don't need medefending themnow they they're getting along withoutme they don't care about me I'm nevergonna meet them they're never gonnanotice if I hate them or not so whatdifference does it makeso they're disqualified I'm not a socialjustice campaign for everyone with themand then you start moving a littlefurther and then you say oh you know I'mgoing to disqualify those successfulpeople with a nuclear family you knowthey're disqualified because they don'tunderstand what the struggle is andthey're probably all just cheating ontheir spouses and hypocrites anyways andthey don't need my help so they'll nevernotice if I hate themso they're disqualified and then you godown a little further and then you pickoff someone else and then you pick offsomeone else and next thing you knowyou're marching down this road let's getmore and more narrow and it's never apersonal thing about the lady sittingnext to you it's always abstract and atthe time that I was getting into this Iwas really hoping like okay this is thisis like how will you bring about socialjustice this is how you make thingsbetter and years would go by andelections would happen and we would havethis governor that governor and nothingwas ever changing and I wasn't seeingany good out of this and you know youwould hear people say you know theDemocrats are morally bankrupt and theleft is an empty ideology you would hearthese things but it couldn't be trueright because you're investing all ofyour energy into this fight for thecause and it can't be an empty ideologyso then you're searching for the meaningbehind it so then you're going furtherand further into the the thoughts andthe thought leaders behind this leftistideology and you're going further andfurther down the road and it's gettingmore and more narrow so then by the timethat I was in high school I hooked upwiththis whole group of friends who werereally far left I mean we were doingsome pretty radical stuff we actuallyhad a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook I'mnot kidding I remember writing papers inschool in defense of domestic terrorismmy friends and I mean they were theydabbled in witchcraft they dabbled insexual perversion experimenting theydabbled in reading nihilisticphilosophers I mean this was the worldthat I lived in pretty much day in andday out like those were my friends thatwas my social sceneI actually remember being in high schooland starting a petition against my highschool newspaper because I thought ithad a Christian bias I seriously didremember doing that that's just kind ofa few examples of the world that I wasliving in and you're going down thisroad and you're just bypassingeverything that is common senseeverything that is rational everythingthat makes society stay together and Ididn't even realize that I was beingsystemic ly divorced from the normalhuman experience that's what it isthat's what leftist ideology is it is aprocess of divorcing you from the normalhuman experience and it is done throughthe guise of first of all divorcing youfrom the people sitting next to you andgetting your attention on some kind ofabstract machination and the end resultwhere this is going is that you willburn every Bridge you will run out ofoptions and you will be totally alonethat's the end result that's where itgoes but nobody tells you thatwhen you're walking down the road and Iactually remember this is I rememberthere were several times when there wasthis moment of divine intervention whensomething would happen to shake me likesomething dramatic would happen and thisdoor would be kicked open for someone totalk sense into me and every time thathappened there was always a conservativeRepublican religious sort of person whowas right there like this this goldenopportunity fell in their lap to talk tome and just when they had me on theropes they dropped the ball they gave upthey backed off maybe they thought thattheir job was in jeopardy maybe theywere afraid of retribution I don't knowwhat it was but more than once when Iwas going down that road there was somekind of supernatural effort to stop meand the judeo-christian conservativepeople who had chances to get through tome consistently missed it because notbecause they were nasty but because theywere always guarded and quiet and almostunwilling to defend the Bible they wouldcome right up to that edge and then Iguess they were afraid that I would beoffended or whatever and just when I wason the ropes they would stop and Idefinitely want to encourageconservative Republicans out therelistening if you've got a young personyou're talking to and you feel thisboldness come over you to say somethingthen you need to say something becauseyou never know when that young personcould be being bulliedor could be depressed and leftistideology might be their coping mechanismand you never know when you are in themidst of a moment when you can talksense into them so if you're in thatsituation and you feel this boldnesscoming up to you and you feel likeyou've got them on the ropes you need tobe bold and you need to launch into aimpassioned defense of judeo-christianphilosophy I'm telling you you need tobecause I'm looking back on my life andI'm realizing if those people had beenas bold as what the leftists are cuz theleftists are johnny-on-the-spot with ananswer and they're they don't stop thereon it and if some of those people in mylife on the right if they had been thataudacious they could have taken me tothe match but they blinked so I wasgoing further and further down this roadgetting more and more radical and all ofmy friends were doing that and thiscarried on until I was my senior year ofhigh school and I actually remember Igraduated high school in 1998 but Iremember when Columbine happened in 1999I was not surprised because I understoodthat whole scene to those of us who hadthat experience Columbine was completelyunderstandable and there's a lot ofyoung people right now who are goingthrough are getting sucked down thatsame path now thank God for me that Inever went so far as shooting up aschool but I wasn't too far off so Ireally thought by the time that Ireached high school senior highI really thought like this world sucksthere's nothing to look/ - everybody's wrong everybody hates meand I was alone because that's what itdoes to you you end up alone and thebiggest thing that I remember feelingwas darkness by the time that I made itto my high school senior year I hadalready survived two suicide attemptsthat's that's true the second one wasactually bad enough that I missed schoolfor a week and I kept going down thisroad thinking like I got into this forsocial justice any day now it'll getbetter I'm gonna find something real Ihave to find something real at the endof this road and I never did and when Igraduated high school I was literally atthe point I thought I was losing my mindand something had to change and finallyagain I was given another challenge toread the Bible and this time I didn'thave anything to lose I said I'll giveit a try now I don't want to make thisvideo religious so I don't want to getsidetracked with my journey to becominga Christian if anybody wants to knowthat story I'll be happy to tell itlater but the Bible was my gateway intoa political change and the thing thatreally changed me was when I startedreading the Bible and really listeningand paying attention and noticing thispattern all throughout the Biblelove your neighbor love your enemy honoryour parents live at peace with all menyou know all of these great idealspeople claim they want but I remember inthe Bible it was always in the contextof a personal friendship it was neverabout an institution it was always aboutthe person sitting next to youeverything in that whole book is aboutpeople and not institutions and youmight be hearing that thinking oh that'scommon sense this was like breaking newsto me this rocked my world and I startedsitting back saying wait a second now Ican't start from the position of being apetulant sarcastic little snitch andthen somehow think that that willproduce more virtue in society like oneof those things does not lead to theotherthat light boats started going off in myhead for the first time ever it wasbreaking news to me and it reallyrattled what I thought I knew aboutculture and society so then I startedwalking through it like wait a secondhere my personal life and the people Imeet in my daily life that is my littlesandbox to practice loving well tocultivate virtue to cultivate anatmosphere of heaven in my world becauseI can't control the government I cancontrol my world and maybe if I did thatand you did that and we all did that atthe same time then our society wouldturn aroundthat was a huge paradigm shift for mewhen I was probably 21 or 22 when thatreally started sinking in so then I wentoff on a mission to try to findlike-minded people who were actuallypracticing personal virtue I went off tofind those peopleand lo and behold I didn't find them onthe left and I didn't find themgenerally speaking in the Democrat Partythere are some good Democrats out thereI'm not I'm not trying to stereotype thewhole party there are a lot of goodpeople who are sort of moderate Centerleftists I am not discounting you butwhat I am saying is I have seen thefurther you go down that leftist Roadthe less light there is and when Istarted comparing personal applicationof love to what I saw from radicalleftists there was just there was noreconciling it was they were so milesapart that I was just like these peopleare the opposite of what the Bible saysliterally so I had no choice all I didwas just start saying okay I'm gonnameet this person right in front of meignore their skin color ignore theirsocial class and just throw all that tothe side look at them as an individualand watch their behavior that's all Idid and I started seeing a crystal cleardifference between people on the leftand then the normal sensible people whoare a part of that normal humanexperience so that's what pulled me muchmore over to the political right andthat's where I am today and like I saidyou might be listening to this and youmight be thinking oh that's Christianity101 or that's Judeo that's Westerncivilization 101 but I'm here to tellyou you cannot take it for granted butthat's common sense anymore you can'tand so many people conservatives peopleon the right they waste so much timeit's Hawking until they're blue in theface saying I love everyone I just I doI just love everyone believe me I loveeveryonebut listen you got to understand whenyou're talking to a radical socialistthe word love doesn't mean what youthink it means to them and when you talkabout loving people you really can'ttake it for granted but they know whatthat word means and the whole time I wassearching for something real I neverheard a good articulation of thatdifference I heard you know talkingabout God's love I heard those thingsbandied about I heard the gospel bandiedabout but I never had it hit home for meso I'm here to sort of encourage otherpeople if you've got a young person inyour life or you know a young person areyou encounter a young person who seemsto be brainwashed by leftist ideologyfirst of all you need to feel sorry forthem because it really is brainwashingand second of all you got to strip itall the way down to the basics don'ttake it for granted that you're usingthe same dictionary because you're notreally think hard about what you believethe underpinnings of what you believethe underpinnings of Westerncivilization you got to come back downto that level and you need to articulatea defence of Western civilization that'swhat you need to do and if you do thatconsistently boldly not being afraid ofoffending them if you go in assumingthat what you believe is offensivethat's a defeatist mentality don't go inthere being on guard saying well I knowyou won't believe me but this is what Ibelieve you've already defeated yourselfbe bold be proud of yourself and startcoming up with anargument that's better than an apologyand I am here to encourage you that ifyou do that you can start making adifference in more young people's livesyou

7xOSXqyysjA,hi this is my walkaway video I wanted toI had done one before and it got cut offso we're doing it and I'm really gladI'm doing a second one because I've it'smore in-depth that I think we mightphrase it as it's not walking away fromthe Democrats or democratic plantationalthough that's part of it but we'rereally walking away from is the erosionof the Constitution is the disparagingand diminishing attitude towards whatthe Founding Fathers established as theUnited States of America so mine I'llmake it short what could be long butI've seen some really short ones andthey're fantasticum is that I was raised in a veryleft-wing household my father was Iwon't even say a rabid liberal though Iused to frame him that way or refer tohim that way but he have she wascommunistic he tried to join theCommunist Party during I think it wasWorld War two he dodged getting into hewasn't even he was a draft dodgerbasically he pretended he was insane sothey wouldn't draft him into the armywhich is really shameful but his brotherwent in I think he was in the Marinesbut anyway hate my father was not intothat I think he was terrified to deathto be honest in any case he fed me andmy sister daily on what his beliefsystem was which was anti-governmentanti-american he was a first generationimmigrant on second generation on hisside his parents could literally cameover from Sicily on Ellis Island youknow they'd have a name change cuz hername wasn't that difficult otherwisethey would and my grandparents made areal life here they my grandmother was aseamstress my grandfather was a tailorray Sicilian traditionaloccupations and they may have their ownbusinesses and own property and even alittle oil derrick and they did well forthemselves here and they didn't complainabout America or hate it in fact theywere so blessed and so appreciative myfather for whatever reason hated it andtransferred that to me like throughosmosis and and through very definitestatements continually through mychildhood so I grew up that way and Iwas a bleeding-heart liberal and I didall liberal things in protests and it'sjust you know had that view thatworldview and and the worldview whereyou don't think for yourself where youdon't examine you don't question youknow it's important to question any sideso in the end when my son right after myson was born nineteen years ago I cameto Christ and in that amazingtransformation of becoming a newcreature in him over a period ofprobably two years I would say two tothree years my politics completelychanged and I started realizing thatconservatism wasn't the enemy that it Ihad shared the same morals the samevalues and I was changed on the insideso I wasn't this renegade person whojust wanted my own way to do what Iwanted and nobody tell me what to dothat was gone for me and I renounced allthat stuff I didn't want it in my lifebecause it's just self-centered reallyand then you justify yourself centeredmissing in any case now once when in the2016 elections just before and I was I'dbeen living in Australia for many manyyears where I came to Christ and I cameback the Lord was leading me back Iworked with Native American kids on areservation and that was during theelection and they were incredibly bluethere but the most of the state I was inSouth Dakota was red in any case but itwas like you felt you could not sayanything and when I came back to AmericaI couldn't believe how divided it was itwasn't it was just shocking and sodisheartening in nonetheless I got tovote in the snow for president Trumpbefore he was president I'd been prayingfor him for months I hadn't wanted tovote for him initially I was a benCarson person but when he decided tostop campaigning and he withdrew I justlooked to the Lord and said well Who amI going to support now what is this Lordand when he told me it was Trump I waslike huh what that man and then heshowed me behind the scenes what wasreally going on and how we needed a manlike that for this time someone whocould you know we didn't pull anypunches someone who in the dogfight ofthe media would actually come up on topbecause they are vicious and people whoare soft-spoken or not fighters are justnot gonna make it in this kind of systemand the dog chooses who he chooses likehe chose Cyrus and he brought Israelback to its senses and I believe this ispart of the plan for a present Trump tobring America back to its senses and andto honor the Constitution it's like theConstitution is absolutely beendesecrated for four decades now andwhether it's a second Amendment whetherit's the lack of value for life lifeitself inside we're outside the wombwhere the people's rights are diminishedthe surveillance all of that it's weneed to return to what this country wasfounded on and I believe that's whatwe're really walking away from thecorruption not just the left yes theleft it can be it can be a myriad ofdifferent stances but yeah the leftembodies it but it's walking away fromthe line that this countryis to be run by money mongers by thepolitical elite by globalists know thiscountry is to be run for buy and leavethe people and I'm so thankful that Iwas shown through the Lord what reallymatters and each one of us does andthat's what this country should be aboutso god bless you all and that's my walkaway[Music]
7zYnHYGbtSw,my name is Nicole I'm from NorthCarolina and I've got some notes herebecause I don't want to ramble on and Ido want to make a couple of points soyou'll send me look down every once in awhile I just want to give you quickly mybackground I'm a registered independentI am in my 50s and I had always votedkind of a mixture of both Democrats andRepublicans and I did that early onbecause I felt like it was a goodbalance like we needed a balance ofthought in our government and amongpolicy makers but as time progressedthrough the 80s into the 90s I could seekind of the fringes of the radical leftbeginning to creep into the Democratsand I had become concerned about thatand so I started still voting a mixtureof Democrats and Republicans but I keptthat mixture more on a local level andvoted more conservative on the federallevel then kind of move into the early2000s I have a friend who is very activein women's issues she's a strictfeminist and she was part of her localDemocrat Party organization and we werediscussing some issues and she keptcoming back around to the phrase of wellthe ends justify the means and I cannotget on board with that and I know whenat first I thought it was just her butthen when I came to learn more about theDemocrats that's really where they comefrom and I'm not gonna say all Democratsactually my mother is a registeredDemocrat and she walked away from theDemocrat Party a long time ago she justnever changed her affiliation officiallyat the at the voting office becauseshe said that she likes to get intodiscussions and then when people accuseher of oh well you're just a Republicanyou won't understand and she says no I'ma registered Democrat so she's one ofthose who says that the Democrat Partywalked away from her a long time ago somy mother is a registered Democrat Ihave a sister that's a registeredRepublican who votes straight Republicanticket and has for a long time so wecome from a pretty diverse you knowpolitical thought within our family butanyway getting back to my friend yeahthey pretty much hold the the thought ofthe ends justify the means that meansthat they can lie if they need to cheatif they need to exhort you know or moveinto violence if they need to and tothem as long as they meet there in gameit doesn't matter to them how they getthere and I cannot go along with thatyou know there's you have to have amoral compass which guides you in youreveryday life and how you approachproblems and how you approach policy sothat was one thing that really put myradar up regarding the Democrats nowthat was back in early 2000 they havesince continued to move in thatdirection I started to do some homeworkfor myself and I found out more aboutthe infiltration of the Democrat Partyby the Communist Party USA and theagenda of the Communist Party and theagenda of the Communist Party if you goand do your own homework really is to isto conquer different enterprises withinthe United States which gives them powerand those enterprises are academiaHollywood the media healthcare that wasa big onethere's several others but those aresome of the and you can see itexactly where they have crept in andthen taken a foothold in those things inorder to sway Americans their thoughtand for them to gain power in Americanpolitics and their agenda in that sensehas worked and you know that's beensomething that's been going on fordecades they've been progressing slowlybut surely but it comes from a Marxistbackground so when Barack Obama came onthe scene in 2008 excuse me my husbandand I my husband who's actually fromNorth Africa he is Jewish and we werewatching all the things about you knowthe 2008 campaign and we began to atfirst we were kind of impressed withBarack Obama and I you know I began tothink hey listen maybe this is somebodyI can get behind I kind of I like toswagger I like the way he spoke he wasyou know but that was very early in hiscampaign and said my husband and I didsome homework on him and found out thathe was actually very entrenched inMarxism I could not get behind that Ialready haven't done my homework on whatwas going on with the Democrats and theinfiltration by the Communist Party USAand what their agenda was and and thefact that the ends justifies the meansso it didn't matter that he could standup there and lie to everybody's facesknowing that that he had an agendatowards something else because that'swhat they dowhen I found out about his backgroundmore about his background more about hisupbringing more about who it was thatwas his mentor then you know I was I wastotally mm-hmm I was like there's no wayI'm pulling the lever for him of coursehe won and we endured eight years of himand then along came Hillary Clinton andwith Hillary then we just got more ofthe continuation of the same thing ofthe ends justifies the means now we'regoing to resort to violence now we'regoing to divide people even furtherBarack Obama did a good job of thatduring his eight years alienating peopledividing people stirring up hate andthat's what the Democrats do they createa crisis then they blame the crisis onother people and then they theyintroduce their solution to the crisiswhich is themselves so because for themthe ends justifies the means so you knowback in the 2000 2000s I just quitvoting for Democrats even though I hadvoted a mixture before so I walked awayfrom them during that time my motherwalked away from them a long time agoand my husband has never voted for aDemocrat my sister votes straightRepublican ticket so I'm still aregistered independent and I willcontinue to be I lean more towardconservative and libertarian and mythoughts on the Constitution is is thestrongest document ever written by anygovernment trying to secure the freedomof people and given giving them a voicein their government so if it is appliedcorrectly and it needs to be appliedcorrectly but it is not outdated it is avery strong document and I think it'sthe best one ever written for anycountry to the people that have walkedaway and are you know were caught up inBarack Obama and Hillary Clinton and allthe pomp and circumstance we you knowsurrounding them and still have friendsentrenched in that that mindset I justwant you to know by coming you know tothis group I think that you're finding ahome it does not mean that you have togo and register as a Republican itdoesn't mean that that it doesn't meananything other than you have a placehere to have freedom of thought freedomof speecheach and piece in your life that you'renot going to be attacked for yourthoughts that we all love you and you'reaccepted here and one thing that I willtell you and this is for my fellow youknow Christians out there anybody who'sGod believing if that's not you andyou're not into that just give me amoment now come back around but I'mspeaking to those other ones you knowI've been praying for a long time forGod to begin to wake people up and I'vebeen praying what Jesus said thatthere's nothing hidden that shall not berevealed and I'm glad that things arebeing revealed and I'm glad that there'speace coming to all of our citizens asAmericans so continue to pray with me onthat on that in but the last thing thatI'm going to say is the only wave Ithink that the Democrats are going tosee coming up is this group of peoplewaving goodbye okay so we love you allI'm glad that you're here I'm glad thatyou're part of free thinkers independentthinkers I want you to continue to doyour homework I want you to continue toresearch the Constitution if you'venever

8GVxdpgZTeU,hey Ivy easily make this video an hourtwo hours long I tend to ramble so I'mgoing to a little bit of editing to makesure that I am getting some main pointsI wonder across and so first BAMobviously I'm a drag queen so I wantedto share this video in drag because Iwant to break some stereotypes aboutbeing a drag queen being trans being inthe queer community being a minority youdon't need to follow a certain set ofrules you don't need to follow certainrestrictions and in fact this time theopposite of what we're all workingtowards in terms of getting to a placewhere we can have self-government andnot have to worry about what otherpeople think about us I am someone whois always had been against bigcorporations big banks rough governmentunfair policing I was actually in st.Louis during the Mike Brown shooting andI was part of my clubs matter rallieswanting to make sure that there weren'tpeople being mistreatedthere weren't unjust policies in placeso I'm someone who cares very much aboutthe underdog and I want to make surethat everyone is getting a voice andbeing heard when I do drag I don'treally do a lot of performing I don't doit to make money and I like to go outmake people feel special help peoplekind of find that inner energy inthemselves to feel special aboutthemselves I think in society there's avery low level of interaction that wecurrently have and a lot of times in thegrand scheme of things we kind of forgetabout individual people I didn't know myparents I was abused as a child and thatkind of upbringing raised me to field Ialways need to question authority and Ialways need to make sure that people arebeing heard and that we're understandingthat people need to be understood ofwhere they might have come from that youdon't know what that is you don't knowwhat they've been through I alwaysthought the liberal side of the argumentwas the correct side aside for justiceand goodwill and caring about people andI tended to see that conservative sideas being kind of overzealous religiousnot trying much about people and kind offocusing on money somebody's back Imoved torecive area and I think that saturationof seeing a lot of progressive people inthe same spot has kind of started toshow me what's going on I started tonotice a lot of people who wereextremely intolerant but they said theywere the most tolerant people around youhad to watch everything you sat aroundthem you know to watch everything youdid around them your freedom was prettymuch gone and subject to their controlthere was still a lot of jokes andnegativity around but it was basicallydecided that you needed to direct thatat the groups that we don't like whystraight says Christian male and as aminority if you didn't join in with thatif he didn't join in with attackingthose groups so if you said hey maybe weshould attack them quite so harshlymaybe we should accept people then youkind of lost your minority card so likeif you're black they'd say oh why areyou white if you're gay you lose yourgay card really silly stuff and theweird thing is that can't treat you likeyou're not on minority anymore likeyou're part of the problem now which isweird because you are still a minorityif you really think about it all thesepeople everyone talking about howthey're other how they have concernsabout the liberal community is stillvery much minority and the fact thattheir voices aren't being respected bythe community is a huge red flag and thepeople they attack they attack with hateand malice and spite and and disturbingcomments if you took some of thecomments on Twitter and Facebook and youreplace the majority groups withminority groups the comments would beobviously disgusting hate speech butthey always have some kind of excuse thenew definition of racismoh I'm I have I'm a minority I'm aminority so I have a lot of aggressionbuilt up oh they had it coming they hadtheir time they were mean to us and Imean be mean to them that wasn't thebiggest wake up rose for me scene wassupposed to be an inclusive communityattacking and eating itself and thepeople that it was supposed to besupporting and protecting it reallywasn't doing that anymore it started tobe obvious that the progressive movementwas only really interested in protectingitself people in the progressivecampaign are entirely disposable as moreand more people are added there alwaysneeds to be someone else who's theproblem so they keep finding someonewho's the new problemI'm seeing new articles were nowgay black and Asian men are the newproblem and it's silly it's absolutelyridiculous to keep just moving the blamefrom group to group to group to group infixing nothing understand sharing ahelpful ideology like explaining why youwant to protect minority is why youmight want to support a certain causebut that's not what's happening what'shappening is that no one's teachinganyone anything that's just hatefulattacks and shaming while I was slowlylosing my liberal faith and not hidingit very much I had many drag queens andweird people come up to me and tell meoh my God thank you for talking aboutthis topic I can't believe people areattacking you for this and I wish morepeople were talking about it but I can'ttalk about it because I don't want to beattacked because I don't want to lose myjob because I don't want to beostracizedso that's solidified to me what kind ofauthoritarian takeover has beenhappening for quite a while in the daycommunity we lost a freedom we lost ourvoices we lost the ability to take thecommunity and say hey I don't like thedirection we're going with this youcan't do that anymore it's not in yourhands because we're listening topoliticians and if we're just listeningto politicians then what's the point ofany of thiswhy have pride why have gay gay rightsmarches if it's not really about thepeople that you're supposed to beprotecting why do any of it it's all asham at the end of the day it ends upbeing a group of individuals and aclose-minded community that stays silentout of fear so that's the story of why Ichose to hashtag walk away I'm blessedto have a group of friends who are verytolerant and intelligent I

8vz2iiORlVU,hi walk away movement I'm Sabrina andthis is kind of my little walk awaystory whatever I can't say that I was Idon't know when I was younger you know Ivoted for Clinton I really liked what hesaid things he did I felt he did reallygood for the economy I didn't reallycare what was going on with all thesexual bedroom stuff that was betweenhim and his wife and then came Bush andI liked him so I voted for him and thenhe fast-forward up to Obama and I didn'tlike him uh I didn't know anything abouthim I felt that he wasn't qualifiedenough that he didn't have enoughexperience I didn't even think about himbeing black or white because he wasmixedyou know white mama raised by his whitemama and I didn't like him some abouthim and when he talked I felt like aused car salesman talking or somethingand I'd get the little hairs on the backof my neck stand up so you know I waslike hmm I'm not voting for him I don'tknow much about him I I just I didn'tlike him and I didn't really like Ithink it was what McCain or somethingthat was running I didn't care for himeither and but I did like Sarah Palinand so I went that direction cuz I likedheard the Bulldog mom you know I relatedto her the issues that she had you knowshe lived a real life and that was me sothat's the way I had voted well mydaughter who is probably won't very oneof the least racist persons I've everright she had black friends many of themokay with the houses she went to theirhouse who they hug out dated black guysshe I guess her friends have found out Iwasn't voting for Obama and they decidedthey couldn't be friends with her nomore brought the bus home the wrong bushome several of them got off at her busstop and proceeded to jump her I endedup having to take her to the emergencyroom they broke her nose busted her eyesupnothing like deadly serious or anythingbut it was enough for me to step backwhoa what what why you know these areyour friends they know you're not racistand that's when I noticed the dividestart happening right then it was like Iwatched people who had been friends for20 years you know become unfriendbecause you're racist all of a suddenyou don't like Obama you're racist ohyou're racist you know like Obama ohyou're right it was like a nine stopthing and he hadn't even been electedyet and it was already startingfast-forward through his um presidencythe first term I just I saw it thedivide was I've never seen it so bad youknow of course I'm not old enough tohave been back in those days but for mylife I had never seen racism come out sobadly as it was becoming you knoweverybody was racist all of a sudden andyou know I was watching my countrybecome tore apart so come the secondtime I was like I am definitely notvoting for this guy you know I I didn'tlike him didn't like him nails on achalkboard when he talked I couldn'twatch him I'm watching the debates onthe second time and every time he talkedI could just cringe and don't get mewrong because theydidn't like the other two either but ofcourse I voted the other two because atleast their beliefs were more instanding with mine in at the time I wasvery angry with Obama for the dividethat was happening in our country sothen you fast forward you know to theTrump saying he he's gonna run well I'vealways liked Trump and if you knowanything about trunk he leaned moredemocratic anyways he only ranRepublican because that was the tickethe had to have to run on because youknow they were already going for Hillaryon the Democrat side but I liked himI've always liked him when I was youngerand I was taking a psychology course wehad to do a paper on Sam Walton andTrump and the differences and how theywere raised and how they did theirbusinesses all this stuff so I had toresearch both of them and I found Trumpto be very generous he was he's verygenerous he does a lot of behind thescene things that you don't even knowabout and then you know he was alwayswith people like Oprah you know him anOprah really good friends and this is ablack woman and he was friends with alot of black people that are out therein the public eye right now that hatehim but they were friends and loved himand loved the money he gave to theircauses and you know things he helpedthem do and I blame Obama for the racismstuff I just I really blame Obama forthe racism stuff but anyways I'm sorry Igot off-track this is a man who has puthis life on hold to come in and helpAmerica to become what it once was youknow the the land of the free you knowyou used to always hear those thingswhere people say you know 2.5 kids whitepicket fences the American Dream youno that's been caught a long time peoplehave been struggling for a very longtime and here he comes and he's like I'mgonna fix this I'm gonna fix this andhe's been trying and he's done a lot sofar but he could only do so muchwithout the Congress and the Senate'shelp I guess people don't understandthat oh you can just write executiveorders but that's not what he wants hewants us to come together as a unityes he's harsh yes he says things thatbut that's who he iswhat you see is what you get and hethat's who he is but he is not racistand I'm watching how our DemocraticParty has just I mean they they've gonetoo far they are you've got homelesspeople living in tent cities all acrossthe country you've got what do they sayone in five children go to

got the nomination anywayduring my time at the universityone of the requirements in my departmentwas that you had to do an internshipwell it just sohappened that my internship was to takeplace in 20002000 if you guys will recall was theelectionwhere the supreme court eventually hadto decide that george bush won theelection because it was too close tocallwell my internship was withal gore's presidential campaign in 2000i worked in the communications areawhich is just a fancy word for sayingthat i worked in the mail roomi was a hardcore democratat that time of course because i grew upin a family full of democratsmy grandmother wasinto local politics here in the countythat i now liveas a school teacher because we lived intennesseeshe worked pretty heavily with the gorefamily she actually receivedan invitation to the inauguration afterclinton was electedwhich would have been really exciting ifwe could have gotten a hotel room butanywayso i went to work for al gore's campaignat the campaign headquarters innashvilleso that was where i first got mymy insider's view on how politics worksbecause the dnc headquarterswere there in the building where i wasworking the first thing that i saw thatithat just struck me as being odd was iwould seemembers of the public come through thedoor right next to my office in themailroomwith stacks and stacks of bush signs intheir hands and i couldn't figure outwhyi mean they would disappear around thecorner and i was busy doing my work soit didn't occur to me to askwhere they were going or what they weredoing it just so happened that i foundout from my supervisor one day i kind ofoften mentionedseeing a guy come in with a stack likelike thisof signs and i said why are we bringingbush signs into the building and sheleftshe said oh you don't know about thebonus program and i said what bonusprogram and she saidwe pay members of the public 25 cents asignand i was like are you kidding they'regoing into people's yards and takingtheirsigns to bring them in to get paid andsheleft and she said yeah i mean we don'twant people toto know that there are people innashville that are voting for bushand i was like that doesn't quite passthe smell test shall we sayi mean i was i was probablylet's see i was18 when i voted for clinton the firsttime so by that point in time i hadalready voted for clinton twiceand was very excited at the prospect ofbeing able to vote for al gore becausehe would have been the third electionthat i had voted in by that pointbecause i spent 10 yearsstudying for my first bachelor's degreeso i'm like nearing thethe very end at that point soi'm kind of watching the way that thecampaign is being runi reached the point where i became sojaded working in the mail roommy job in the mail room was to open uplettersfigure out what subject the person waswriting about and then we had littlebaskets scattered around the room forletters where we would take the envelopeand staple it to the back of the letterif it had the person's return address onit if you wrote a letter to al gorein 2000 and received a form letterchances are good i was the person thatput yourname and address in the database to havea letter sent to youso that was my job well you can imaginealong with letters people also mailedchecks and it was at that point that ilearnedif the check is up to a certain amountstaple the check to the letter and putit in this basket over herebut if the check is over this amountwhich of course i didn't realize was thelimit to how much a person could write acheck for to donate to a campaigni was to take the check and the letterin handto al gore's war room and pass it off toa member of their staffi'll get more into that later on butanyway i reached the point where i didnot watch the news anymorebecause i knew every time we made amistake because we would get an influxof letters telling us exactly why wemade a mistakei tracked how well the campaign wasdoing from the number of letters that wegot in my mail room every weekso you can imagine as the electionprogressed it's getting closer toelection timethey brought all of us in communicationstogether and explain that after acertain day we wouldn't be sending outany more letters because they wanted tomake sure that the letters got to peoplebefore election daynot an uncommon practice butinstead of putting people's names in thecomputer likethat was my normal jobthe last two weeks of the campaignbecause i wasn't sending out lettersanymorethey brought me with a chairand a shredder they sat me downin the big open area where the where thecampaign office wasand explained to me that i was going tobe shreddingdocuments for the campaign because i hadto do something i meani was i was already there sothey brought a box like big box oflettersset them down next to me and told me runthese through the shredder when it whenthe bag is fulltake it off put it off to the sidehere's another bag so on and so forth soi'm thinking okaythat's fine until i start looking at thelettersmost if not all the letters that i wasshreddingwere in regards to those those checksthati had to take to the war room becausethey were morethan people were supposed to be able todonate they had me shredding evidencethat people had mailed checksat that point i realized quickly youknow whatit's always the little guy that getssent to leavenworthand i'm just saying they just assumethat i'm a stupid intern that's notgoing to knowthat i'm essentially being asked tocover upillegal activity that was the firstmomentthe very first moment the second waswhen donna brazilelet all of us interns people that werethat were basically working for freebecause we were college studentsthat we were that we were going to berequired to work 40 hours a week in theweeks leading up to the election or theywould not sign off on our hours forcollegei ended up being on school suspensionfor a year after that because my gradesfellthrough the floor because i had to skipclasses every day for like two weeksbecause of this so yeah no love lostespecially not now that she's on foxanyway skipping on aheadthat was when i learned studying to be amember of the news mediawe were trained to write articlesat an eighth grade understanding levelthat was my first time really realizingthat the news media assumes that thepeople that they're writing forhave a distinct lack of intelligencei knew my family members people thatthat were hardcore democratsthat deserve so much better than the waythey were treatedbut even then i still continue to votedemocrati voted democrat every election until2016.my husband and i have been married for12 yearshe he was with me i mean he had voteddemocratpretty much all his life up untilthe point that we moved back to texas myhusband is originally from texasand in 2010 my husband and i moved fromtennesseeall the way down to texas that was wherei first started to really get intopoliticsso we were kind of watching and i knewthat i didn't like hillary because ofhow badly she had treated the womenthat had accused her husband of sexualassault i'm not talking about monicai'm talking about the others the onethat trump had the ones that trump hadat that press conference right after theaccess hollywood tape came outso i knew that i couldn't vote for herbecause she used every ounce ofpolitical capital she had tobury those women and then had theaudacity to claimthat she and the democrats were theparty of womeni was like nowhen i was working for gore's campaign iwas very impressed with john mccainnot a popular opinion at the campaignheadquarters as you can imagineuntil he chose sarah palin for hisrunning mate and i knew the reason thathe chose her was because he was tryingto appeal to womenand that was the first time that i everthought i am not going to vote for youjust because you chose a woman to beyour running matei'm not going to vote for somebody justbecause she's a woman she has to bequalified she has to have views that iagree withso when hillary's entire campaigncentered around the fact that it washer turn andthat she just she gave off the air ofsomebody that just believed that it washer turnand i'm thinking to myself you're gonnahave to give me more thanjust the fact that i should vote to notbetray my gendersomething of course that i was toldafter the campaign and his electionso we were still living in texaspreparing to move back to tennessee whenthe primary happened in 2016.my husband voted for marco rubio i votedfor berniebecause i was still on the democrat sidebutknew that i couldn't stomach voting forher so i voted for himbecause i liked a lot of his ideashaving not really a lot of understandingabout how they would get paid for thatwas my firstmistake but anyway soafter the primary when trump got thenominationthat was when the media completely losttheir mindsbut i think the true moment when ifinally just saidyou know what never again was whenhillary came out and calledhalf of trump supporters she could putthem in a basket of deplorables and i'mthinking to myselflet's be real you don't mean half of usyou meanall of us all of us that didn't vote foryou all of us that disagree with youall of us in the flyover states one ofmyfavorite favorite videos to watch fromelection nightis the young turks becauseit's it epitomizes the disdainthat people havefor people that come from states likemineif you don't live on the coast or you'renot part of the coastal elites they haveno use for youat all i mean i watch the newsokay i'll give you a good examplesomething that i learned from fromstudying for my degree in journalismon inauguration daythey had well first they had thepicturesof the empty the emptyspaces where they claim that nobodyshowed up for the inauguration which iknew wasa load of crap because one of my localorganizations said that there werepeople turned away at the gate becausethere were so many people so i knewthat was a lie immediately but theni watched them disparage donaldfor when he and melania came down in thecarwhere they were supposed to meet withthe obamas for breakfastthey criticized donald for jumping outof the carand leaving melania behindbut the video that they shot cut off ata certain pointso i did some searching and i looked forthe video thatthe rest of it because i knew from theabruptness of the way they cut it offthat there was something we weren'tsupposed to seesure enough it's donald rushing aheadwhile the driver opens the door frommelaniaso that he can run up and open the doorfor the obamas in a sign of respectthey cut that part off of the video toshow that he's a misogynist that leaveshis wife behindhe's a racist two of his wives areimmigrants for god's sakeyou know i grew up around democrats ialways thought that the republicans werethe racistsuntil i learned after doing someresearch thatthe republican party was foundedto eliminate slavery that was thepurpose for the entire republican partybeing founded in the first placebut then i started getting argumentsfrom people that i worked with sayingyeah but that was so long ago and i'mlike well how about the voting rightsact of 64.is that close enough for you and theywere like what do you mean i saidthe democrats voted unanimously againstthathillary raised barry goldwaterand margaret sangeri can't begin to tell you how shocked iwas when i found the videoof her talking about eliminating thenumbers in the black communityand then i started to think all theplanned parenthoods in the areas where igrew upare in the poor areas why do we thinkthat isare we trying to get rid of people thatwe think are a drain on society are youkidding mebut sure i'm the racist are you kiddingso there's that there's the open disdainthat the entire democrat establishmenthas held and the mediawho i view is nothing more than a than abunch of propagandists for thedemocratic partyso these are just some of the many manymany reasonsthat i chose to walk away i went frombeingan absolute vehement liberal all my lifeto taking that red pillin the fall of 2016unless they fix the the links thatthey've fallen downi will never vote democrat again 2016was the first timethat i had ever voted straight party allthe way downbefore that i was a person that wouldvote for the person whether they wererepublican or democrat i kind of tendedto think of myself as a modderkind of a moderate i have familyfriends that have all turned their backson me because they think thati am against gay people because i votedfor donald trumpi believe that every person deserves theright to be happyand the right to have their voices heardin facton election night they scheduled me toclose at the store that i was working atwhen the return started to come in everyperson that i worked with at that storevoted democrat i was like maybe one ofmaybe threepeople that didn't i sat and held theirhands when they criedbecause i remember standing in thelegislative plaza in nashville when gorelostuntil two in the morning when he had hiscampaign manager come down to tell us togo homeyou can imagine when hillary didn'taddress her supporters after theelection i was like well that looksfamiliarstop showing disdain for the people thatthatgive their blood sweat and tears to youtrying to use every nasty trick that youcan pullto accomplish your goals stop clingingto power with withall your bony fingersyou have to recognize the people thatput you there in the first place and idon't think the democratic party at thispoint does thati have found so much love and acceptancein this groupwhen i found your video brandon it was alifesaverthank you so much hashtag walk away

twodecades hardcore Democratand never had a problem disputingpolitics with Republicans neverexperienced hate or anything like thatand then I voted for Obama definitely Imean who wouldn't if you're a Democratperfect candidate and an interestingthing happened I went back to school tostudy a different subject outside ofanimal science which led me to takeAmerican history classes and a lot ofconstitutional study classes where youlearn about the Constitution in thehistory of the Constitution and Istarted having thoughts that you knownow that I'm getting a betterunderstanding of the history and libertyand freedom and what it means that maybeI've been wrong all these years and so Ikind of delve into the whole politicalscene and got really involved in it andthen I started noticing something myRepublican friends on my facebook werevery thoughtful debaters never a harshword to me ever when I supported Obamaand liked what he was doing for acertain period of time but then Inoticed when I started speaking outagainst left-leaning ideology that Ikind of felt had changed since theKennedy Democrats I noticed that myliberal friends rather than engaging andthoughtful debate or using facts startedcalling me names I mean I don't evenknow if I should say what names they'recalling me but one particular comes tomind where someone who is raised in theexact circumstances is mean not that faraway from me growing up called me adick-sucker racist bigoted hillbilly andwatch go suck someor caulk I mean come on I mean howmisogynist is that anyways to start withbut anyways one night like I said I'dfor a couple years now they I have beenresearching politics one night at dawnedon me that I am NOT a Republican I meanI am NOT a Democrat I am a Republicanand I aligned with Republican ideologyand I cried all night long to my husbandadmitting to the horrible mistake that Ihad meet I felt like I really betrayedmy country voting Democrat for all thoseyears and here I stand I was not a

A2LhqdIyqxM,my name is Mike I was a huge Obamasupporter in 2008 along with my husbandyou know we were very excited when whenhe was elected and after about a year ortwo of his presidency at this point Ireally had nothing to do with him but Iwas doing a lot of research Monsanto andGMO and throughout that research I foundout that Obama had appointed MichaelTaylor to the FDA and that's what Iwould kinda consider when I swallowedthe red pill I love that analogy by theway I know it's everyone's using it butI just love it so after that happened Istarted doing doing more research on myown and digging deeper and deeper downthat rabbit hole come 2012 I had alreadymade the decision that I wasn't gonnavote for Obama again and so I startedresearching other candidates and I cameacross Ron Paul and his message ofindividual freedom and liberty reallyresonated with me so I picked up hisbooks and I read his books I startedpaying attention to what he was sayingand it was kind of amazing because whenI would hang out with friends or familyat that point I would kind of bring RonPaul up and not all the time but a lotof the time the first words out of theirmouth were the same words were hearingnow the same rather rhetoric we hear nowoh that guy's a racist that guy's ahomophobe that guy's a bigot and it kindof threw me back becauseI have been paying attention to whatthis guy was saying and I and and and Ihad read his books and I were and Ithought to myself he's me he's none ofthose things and another big thing to mein 2012 was gay marriage and of course Ilooked into Ron Paul's stance on gaymarriage the end his stance was that thegovernment shouldn't even be a marriageand that that blew my mind I had nevereven considered thinking of it that waybefore and and that's that's really whenyou can say that that the red pill tookeffect and I haven't looked backso by 2016 there's not a whole lot I gotto say about the last election besides Ihad already made the decision to walkaway from from the Democratic Party youknow one thing that really sticks outfor me it was the Berkeley riots whichyou know they downplayed his protestsbut but we all know that they were theywere riots and and the home of freespeech Berkeley the home of free speechand they're they're rioting because theydon't want somebody to speakthat was the nail in the coffin and ifthere wasn't already a nail in thecoffin for me and the Democratic Partyof course I looked up my lowly innopolisand I started listening to what he hadto say and Milo's Milo but but hedefinitely wasn't the monster that theyportrayed him to be sowhat I what I what I really want to sayis the beauty I'm finding in thismovement is it's it's not necessarilythat you have to jump on the Trump trainI fully respect you if you do I love itif you do that's that's your choicemy husband supported Trump but but whatreally what really gets to me is is Ithink the message is about seeingunderstanding and walking away from thetoxicity that the Democratic Party hasbecome you know now is the time to standup against the mob and that that hivementality will only last so long beforeit collapses and you to self -

AE4putuUJiM,how are you doing everyonei wanted i was really thinking of makingthis videoi just didn't want to really like iwanted to get my thoughts togetherand try to see if i could break thisdown and try to see if i couldbring some sense into some people i'vebeen uh i've beeni've been living in the bronx for halfof my life i was born in puerto ricoand i came here uh i was raised back andforth i used to live in puerto rico cometo new york i wouldn't even lived inchicago for a little bitand my deals has always been democratthey're brew and i recentlystarted moving more to the right and forthe reason isthat uh i see there's a lot of uhtoxic negativity going on in thedemocratic partyand in the liberal side everythingbothers them they want to abolisheverything everything willeverything is racist and they don'treally see what it's straight they don'treally think straightand why i say that is that all thisthing going on right nowwith the police uh one of the phonepoliceaccusing every white men of being racistaccusing everybody you know it's just awhole bunch of nonsense that to mereally needs to be addressed and reallyneeds to be we need to sit down and talkabout this asa country because i see this countrygoing down the hilland it's particularly the democraticparty that is pushing for thisand accusing trump of being the one thatuh is actuallydestroying the country when it'sactually dumb pushing to destroy thiscountryand it's and it's crazy it's likeeverything they they dothey actually do and everything thatthey actually push for and everythingthey always blame the other side ofbeing the ones doing it when it's donethat's doing it it's like it's crazyand for example they like to accusetrump of being a pedophile or rapistwhen it's the democratic party inparticularthis bit mostly there's mostly evidenceof thatand also the uh election meddlingthere's anelection fraud they always accuse thethe republicans of being the ones doingit when it's dumb there's more evidenceout there that theyactually are the ones that always dothis fraudsin elections and it's just reallygettingout of hand are we after me as a puertorican i had to sit down and think aboutthis becausewe are black and we are white and we areindians and we have all thesecombinations in our in our racethat i feel that we are the only onesthat can clearhave a clear voice and unite the countryi understand people have different umviews of economic systems some peoplewant socialismothers love capitalism i used to be asocialisti used to be i used to be a fidel castrofan check about a fani used to have i used to follow thatthat division i used toum participate a lot in all puerto ricannationals activitiesum i used to be very anti-american iused to always hate america andeverything was racism the government wasthe most evilbut it came to a point in my life that ireally had to thinkthis through is america that badthis is the greatest country in theworld why i say thatbecause we have the best freedoms wehave the best constitutioncreated by man now are we gonna sit hereand blameour founding fathers for what thethey didhundreds of years ago it doesn't makeany sense to meit's

appreciate it i appreciatethe history i appreciate everythingabout itand i think about it should we destroya cathedral just becauseslave owners created it are we reallygonna go down that roadare we really going to go down the roaddestroying old san juan the whole of sanjuanjust because spanishslave owners created it it doesn't makeany sense to meit's our history we need to love it andappreciate it regardless of whathappenedit's over with it doesn't exist anymorewhy can't we just move on as a countryand just face the issues that actuallyexist right nowwe are fighting against things thatdoesn't even exist anymorewe're not facing slavery we're notfacing anyoppression stop it stop crying like ababyyou are stupid and you're sillyyou see everything i don't know whatkind ofwhat kind of i don't understand how canthese people that think that you'resmartthey're actually some academics thinkthis wayit's just doesn't i you know i don't getit through my head how can you be sodumb and so ignorant and so missed infourare we gonna go down the road destroyingthis country just because we're fightinga ghostliterally we're fighting ghosts thisdoesn't make any sense to me it's justcrazyi hear my family hear my friends andhear people that i know for so longtalk like this it just it's mind-blowingit's just how the hell do you even fighta ghosthow you fight things that happenedhundreds of years ago that doesn'taffect you anywayhow do you want to bring those statuesit doesn't affect you at alland oh it doesn't affect you and i'mcanceling shows likeit doesn't make any sense to me why youcanceling shows forjust because you don't like it doesn'tmean somebody else might not like itmight like it you know it'sif you don't want to wash it don't washit it's as simple as thatyou don't got to go get a fit catch afit over something that doesn't make anydoesn't really affect you literally it'slike so many ignorant people nowadaysis crazy and that's why i had to moveaway from the leftbecause the life is toxic it's poisonedto your soul it's poisoned to your brainyou really people when you really needto think this throughwe have the greatest country we havemoved past a lot of issuesthere's always gonna be problems in oursystemcops are not all racist i seelisten when i used to live in the southbronx i still live in the bronx but nowi live more in the north sidebut when i used to live in the southbronx by 138 in brook avenuethere was an officer called ramirez hewas a puerto rican officerhe used to abuse everybody everybodyused to be scared of thishe used to abuse particularly the puertoricans that's the crazy parti've seen black officers kill blackpeople i've seen why officers kill whitepeoplei see indian officers kill people ofcolorit doesn't matter p the problem withthis country isthat police got too much immunitythey'll abuse their powerand since they know they could get awaywith it most of the timethey use it and abuse it that's theproblem with this with the situationright here right nownot that the old cops are racist not theold white people are racistwe have a problem with this country thatpolice think that they could get awaywith anythingthat's the problem and we that's what weneed to addressnot accuse everybody not not go crazynot catch a fitnot just by destroying the country weneed to address the problemfrom its roots if we don't really facethe problemof what it is we're not going to fix itwe're going to continueescalating problem after problem becausewe're notgoing to the root of the issue andthat's what i wanted to saythank you so much for listening to myvideo take care peace out
aMsHqwNME-c,how's it going everybody Zack here andI'm back with a video for you todaytoday is actually a great day to be ableto make this video because I only justdiscovered that this was actually amovement that I was not the only personthat felt this way for such a long timeas you probably have figured it out bythe title of this video this is going tobe my walk away story about how I wasraised conservative and then I became aDemocratic Party supporter and a liberalsocial justice warrior as its evidencedin my previous video and I want to talka little bit of a my journey kind ofjust transitioning away from that andwhy I decided to walk away fromliberalism and the Democratic Party umit's just amazing first of all toactually feel like I'm not the only onewho feels this way and even though itmay not be evident there's probably alot of people who also feel this way andthe fact that this is actually a thingis pretty crazy because I've beenfeeling this way for months you know upuntil maybe about eight nine or tenmonths ago I'd say this year in general2018 probably the end of 2017 I had abit of a red pill moment and I just kindof went into the details and I was Ithink what started it all was the Mileyinnopolis protests at Berkeley and thatwas in basically my neighborhoodBerkeley just down the street it's atown that's close to Oakland and it mademe investigate that a little bit and asprobably a lot of other people who areembracing you know a different idea nowwhether it's more conservative oranything which is where I'm at now ismore of a conservative standpoint itmade me kind of just really really takea look as to why this guy is generatingso much controversy and I really reallylistened to what he had to say and ofcourse with that I discovered otherpeople like ben shapiro and dave rubinand a lot of other folks but I didn'tget there because I was just looking onthe Internetover time I had felt prettydisenfranchised with the DemocraticParty and that there were a lot ofpromises to help minority ISM to helpfight racism and everything yetnothing's been done in the past fewyears you know I had voted for Hillaryin the 2016 election and had seen andthat was kind of Reich right around theend when I was a social justice warriorI have just finished college and wasthinking about that but then I startedto investigate it furtherone of the biggest defining factors wasben shapiro there was there's a videoonline of ben and how he talks aboutpro-choice i believe it's eitherpro-choice or abortion and I had beenraised conservative and after havinglooked into abortion and just what it'sabout I realized that it's somethingthat i morally cannot support it's justthere's a part of me that after seeinghow horrific it is no part of meactually agrees with that so I startedinvestigating it further looking intoreally really researching what the factswereand eventually I found out that this iswhat the truth isokay I'm liberalism on college campusesand social justice has basically put theblame on everybody else and the thing isof course I mean that's how you wouldfeel if you're a minority in America isyou're gonna want to hear that and goyeah my struggle I am oppressed becauseof somebody else when in reality that'snot the case in a land like America in acountry like America you can make itwhat you want for yourself and if you'rea US citizen you have the ticket tobasically creating the life that youwant to create and foster your ownbeliefs but unfortunately um it justmade no sense anymore you know I startedlistening to arguments surrounding thirdwave feminism and I actually go intothis in my other video about why I whenI talked about social justice and thatis just there's so much intolerancebelligerence with people and especiallyin a place like the San Francisco Bayit's just that's all you hear is justpeople protesting about what and notreally really making any chainin their own lives and I mean mythoughts are not very structured in thisvideo but it this video that I'm makingabout my walk away is exactly why I'm nolonger social justice warrior it's alsowhy I decided to leave the left and I'min pursuit of facts not feelings factsare what get things done at the end ofthe day and it's not about the feelingsand it's also when I started to learn alittle bit more about the history of theDemocratic Party about how the originalKKK were all Democrats or the fact thatum originally the Democrats were broughtinto play is to keep poor people pooryou know and as long as they had yourvote you could keep them in office and Istarted investigating it further andthen I just felt disenfranchised youknow all of this happened at the sametime as me kind of becoming red pillaware which is another thing but it wasabout taking the facts of the world andevaluating on what you believe is rightand to be honest I made that socialjustice video about what I used to beone before I realized that this walkawaything was an actual thing and this isamazing because now there's thousands ofor perhaps even millions of Americansyoung people like myself who used to bedemocratic who used to believe inliberalism and no longer want toassociate with that because it's nothingbut a movement of hate about blaming thepatriarchy for all your problems nottaking responsibility for yourself thatyou know as long as you just listen aslong if you don't agree with what I haveto say and then you're automatically aracist or you're automatically ahomophobe and I just want nothing to dowith it anymore it's just about that'sessentially it you know and it's allbased in the facts the facts or what isgoing to affect change and createlong-lasting progress in America and notfeelings that's really the bottom lineis it comes down to facts you govern acountry based on the facts not on thebiases and the prejudices of its peopleso that's my story that's my walkawaystory I just want to kick out a quickvideo for you guys todaylet me know what you think of this videoand what your story is and yeah my nameis Zack I come out with videos every daydo hit that subscribe button if you likewhat you see I'll link the video to mywhy I used to

rubinand a lot of other folks but I didn'tget there because I was just looking onthe Internetover time I had felt prettydisenfranchised with the DemocraticParty and that there were a lot ofpromises to help minority ISM to helpfight racism and everything yetnothing's been done in the past fewyears you know I had voted for Hillaryin the 2016 election and had seen andthat was kind of Reich right around theend when I was a social justice warriorI have just finished college and wasthinking about that but then I startedto investigate it furtherone of the biggest defining factors wasben shapiro there was there's a videoonline of ben and how he talks aboutpro-choice i believe it's eitherpro-choice or abortion and I had beenraised conservative and after havinglooked into abortion and just what it'sabout I realized that it's somethingthat i morally cannot support it's justthere's a part of me that after seeinghow horrific it is no part of meactually agrees with that so I startedinvestigating it further looking intoreally really researching what the factswereand eventually I found out that this iswhat the truth isokay I'm liberalism on college campusesand social justice has basically put theblame on everybody else and the thing isof course I mean that's how you wouldfeel if you're a minority in America isyou're gonna want to hear that and goyeah my struggle I am oppressed becauseof somebody else when in reality that'snot the case in a land like America in acountry like America you can make itwhat you want for yourself and if you'rea US citizen you have the ticket tobasically creating the life that youwant to create and foster your ownbeliefs but unfortunately um it justmade no sense anymore you know I startedlistening to arguments surrounding thirdwave feminism and I actually go intothis in my other video about why I whenI talked about social justice and thatis just there's so much intolerancebelligerence with people and especiallyin a place like the San Francisco Bayit's just that's all you hear is justpeople protesting about what and notreally really making any chainin their own lives and I mean mythoughts are not very structured in thisvideo but it this video that I'm makingabout my walk away is exactly why I'm nolonger social justice warrior it's alsowhy I decided to leave the left and I'min pursuit of facts not feelings factsare what get things done at the end ofthe day and it's not about the feelingsand it's also when I started to learn alittle bit more about the history of theDemocratic Party about how the originalKKK were all Democrats or the fact thatum originally the Democrats were broughtinto play is to keep poor people pooryou know and as long as they had yourvote you could keep them in office and Istarted investigating it further andthen I just felt disenfranchised youknow all of this happened at the sametime as me kind of becoming red pillaware which is another thing but it wasabout taking the facts of the world andevaluating on what you believe is rightand to be honest I made that socialjustice video about what I used to beone before I realized that this walkawaything was an actual thing and this isamazing because now there's thousands ofor perhaps even millions of Americansyoung people like myself who used to bedemocratic who used to believe inliberalism and no longer want toassociate with that because it's nothingbut a movement of hate about blaming thepatriarchy for all your problems nottaking responsibility for yourself thatyou know as long as you just listen aslong if you don't agree with what I haveto say and then you're automatically aracist or you're automatically ahomophobe and I just want nothing to dowith it anymore it's just about that'sessentially it you know and it's allbased in the facts the facts or what isgoing to affect change and createlong-lasting progress in America and notfeelings that's really the bottom lineis it comes down to facts you govern acountry based on the facts not on thebiases and the prejudices of its peopleso that's my story that's my walkawaystory I just want to kick out a quickvideo for you guys todaylet me know what you think of this videoand what your story is and yeah my nameis Zack I come out with videos every daydo hit that subscribe button if you likewhat you see I'll link the video to mywhy I used to be a social justicewarrior down

a video for you todaytoday is actually a great day to be ableto make this video because I only justdiscovered that this was actually amovement that I was not the only personthat felt this way for such a long timeas you probably have figured it out bythe title of this video this is going tobe my walk away story about how I wasraised conservative and then I became aDemocratic Party supporter and a liberalsocial justice warrior as its evidencedin my previous video and I want to talka little bit of a my journey kind ofjust transitioning away from that andwhy I decided to walk away fromliberalism and the Democratic Party umit's just amazing first of all toactually feel like I'm not the only onewho feels this way and even though itmay not be evident there's probably alot of people who also feel this way andthe fact that this is actually a thingis pretty crazy because I've beenfeeling this way for months you know upuntil maybe about eight nine or tenmonths ago I'd say this year in general2018 probably the end of 2017 I had abit of a red pill moment and I just kindof went into the details and I was Ithink what started it all was the Mileyinnopolis protests at Berkeley and thatwas in basically my neighborhoodBerkeley just down the street it's atown that's close to Oakland and it mademe investigate that a little bit and asprobably a lot of other people who areembracing you know a

aqGANUGUD3k,so today i was toldthat i need to go myself because ofwho i supporti've been a democrat at hearts way i wasraisedthey were for equality gay rights blackrights doesn't matter who you arethey're for equalityit's the way i was raisedi've been against president trump sincehe was electedup until this year i finally stopped anddid research of my ownfound out everything that i was toldthat he's a racist a liar everythingelsewas just to make me hate him i haven'tseen any evidence of itnever have and never willbut today when my so-called party thati'm part ofsays that peaceful protesting involvesburning down buildings looting storesruining other people's lives that to meis not peaceful protesting and that'swhat made me walk awayfrom the democratic partytonight i was told by one of my liberalfriendsto go myself because i supporttrump for 2020.it's funny though growing up democratyou're taughtlove everybody respect everybodyeverybody has their right to do whatthey wishbut when it comes down to it you startviewing things differently than they doall of a sudden that policy goes rightout the windowdo i support trump for 2020 yes i dodo i support the democratic party in thefuture most likely notthis year i have walked awayi have lost a lot of friends actuallyover the last couple weeks especiallyall because of who i supportmyself i am a gay manand i've been called a right-wingedtraitor because i support trumpand became a republican this yeari just don't get howpeople who preach nothing but peace andkindness and love for everybody can beso hateful but in turncall us hateful because of our supportfor trumpwho's supposed to be this big racistsexistbigot and you know what i believedeverything the media said about thatup until this year when i finallystarted realizing stuffhey was it from trump's side of theracistsexist bigotry it was the democraticsidethat i've seen to itand i've lost a lot of friends this yearbecause of my support for trump andwalking away from the democratic partyjust hope in the future i can make somenew ones that actuallyeither support the same views i have ordoesn't matter to them what views i havehashtag walk away 20 20.have a good day
aRoj_2fY7sc,so I I had not been paying muchattention to the quote walkaway movementyou're all familiar with hashtagwalkawayso I read a little bit about thethinking behind it and I was wonderingwhat policy is it in particular is is itbecause you know my assumption which wasincorrect my assumption was that maybeit's policy related or maybe it's youknow they just prefer the Republicanpolicies after all or maybe it's they'rejust saying that the president is beingeffective in a general way that's what Ithought before I read the details oh ohmy viewers this is way more interestingon that I don't know if you quite caughtit but let me put it in context I liketo talk about the most you know how Italk about the persuasion filter it's away of looking at the world as ifeverything is persuasion and the factsand reason are things we pretend we careabout but sort of don't and I've alsosaid that President Trump and I saidthis I know two years ago would quotepunch a hole in the universe or or put atear in the universe so that you couldlook through the hole and see realityfor the first time because we all walkaround in this little little bubblemovie of our own making and I said thathe's gonna let you see reality at leasta little bit of it not all of it cuzwe're not we're not able but he wouldput a hole in your current bubble so youcould just peek out and see what's onthe other side and you'd say holy capI'm in a bubble so really the mostyou're gonna get out of this is theknowledge certain that you've beenliving in a bubble of truth that youcreated in your own head as opposed totruth that exists at the universe andapparently that's what happened toBrendon Straka because here's how hedescribes his thinking behind the walkawaywas it about policy here's what it wasabout he realized that the Democratswere using fear to manipulate peoplethat's a big dealthat's a big deal that's peeking throughthe hole in the universeit wasn't about policies wasn't aboutout you know which leaders a little moreeffective was it about who cares aboutyou wasn't about who's got the bestplans for the future he realized thatone side was manipulating them with fearand that that's all that was going onwell that's not all this going on butthat was the big picture the big picturewas persuasion that was fear-based andthe fear wasn't real now you're sayingto yourselfTrump uses fear to manipulate you tohere's the difference the fear thatTrump uses and and he does use the fearto manipulate he's talking about fear ofpeople outside the country in many caseswho have actually killed lots of peoplelike Isis and terrorists so when he'stough on the border he's pointing toms-13 who are real people ms-13 actuallykills people and apparently we're onlyjust learning that the althoughimmigrants as a group have an unusuallylow crime rate yeah immigrants a veryPro immigrant low crime rate greataddition to the country but among theclass of illegal ones were breaking thelaw to get in it turns out that the rateof murder and violent crime and stuff isis far higher than their percentage inthe population so they are literally ahigh crime group just the illegalimmigrants in general awesome peoplecontributing to the countrylower cried in the normal lower crimethan average so Trump's fear is based onpeople who really exist and really arehurting people those are things youactually should be worried about Trump'sfear would be you know you could arguethat he's scared everybody with NorthKorea but that's a real fear and he gota pretty good result there or at leastit seems to add in the right directionso but if you look at now look at theDemocrats version of fear their fear isof your fellow citizen is that a sexistterm can you say that anymore can yousay your fellow citizen is that sexistwhat's what's the generic ways that yourother citizens your teammates your yourcountry people comrade citizen somebodysays so notice the huge difference thereso Brendon Straka has realized that theDemocrats are creating fear of eachotherTrump is creating fear almost entirely Ican't think of an example of people whoare outside our borders who areliterally armed and dangerous peoplewith actual guns and weapons who areactually using them it's a little bitdifferent right there's one thing youshould be afraid of and there's onething that's largely invented and enoughtime has now passed so that anyreasonable citizen can see that thethings that people said about Trump wereclearly untrue that there was a fearthat he would tank the economy not truethere was a fear that you would blow upthe world with nuclear weapons and neverget anywhere with North Korea cuz he's ahe was a crazy man he's crazier than kimjungeun and not true and you know whatit wasn't even true that kim jungeun iscrazy andanyway that matters for negotiatingnegotiated what else is oh there was afear that you would he would round upgay people and you know put them incamps obviously not true there was afear that you know he would do this orthat anyway so it's becoming more andmore clear to the people on the leftthat they've been taken by their ownside that they're their own side isusing fear of their of their own countrypeople I don't want to say countrymenyou know you realize how sexist all ofour old terms are but that is a powerfulit's a very powerful thought and if thiswalk away thing had been you know basedon oh I think I've changed my mind and Ilike the Republican policies better I'dsay to myselfyeah that's not much you know a fewpeople will change change partiesbecause the policy is no big dealbut when people are talking aboutchanging parties because they realizedthat they're being taken that they'rejust being taken manipulated by fear andthat they're let me let me put this inperspective I imagine if you will thatall of the coverage of this Presidenthad been just straight objectivecoverage that then nobody ever gave anopinion of what they thought he would door what they thought he was thinkingwhat if the only coverage you'd seen hadbeen coverage of Trump as a person whodoes stuff and you just observe what hedoes you know compared to maybe what hepromised and say yeah yeah he's he'sdoing the things that we got elected foretc here's what people think of ithere's what they don't you know the butbut if the news had notbecome let's say participants in thepolitical process had they moved hadthey not moved from an observer watchdogrole to actual participants they'retrying to to you know move the needlewould the left be afraid of thispresident a little maybe just becauseyou know it's a big country and a lot ofdifferent opinions a lot of differentindividuals but probably nothing likewe're seeing I would argue that close toa hundred percent of the fear thatpeople have about this president isbased on you know non objective coveragewould you say that's true would youagree with me that almost a hundredpercent of the fear the the I'm talkingabout the irrational fear the the thingthat makes people vomit and and shakebecause that's what people areexperiencing right you know joke all youwill about you know the the leftyou know howling at the moon and stufflike that but this is a real medicalproblem they're they've lived for 18months in in total fear where is thatfear coming from well they've beenmanipulated into believing it's comingfrom the president that it's because ofthe things he's doing the things he'sthinking which is crazybecause they don't know what he thinksand the things that in their imaginationhe might do those things all come fromthe press you know in the the opinionpart of the press mostly that's notcoming from the president what has thepresident said recently that would scarea citizen of the United States now I dothink there's a role of the press andthat the public opinion and everythinghas changed this president's policypreferences so for example when he wascampaigning he was talking aboutdeporting 14 million people who are hereundocumented but otherwisegood citizens and of course he's notdoing that it doesn't look like there'sanything any real chance of thathappening so there are some big thingsthat we see the public pretty muchimmediately causes president to changeopinions take the children in cages forexample you know the public had its sayand it looked like a public had his sayand he changed now somebody saying whatabout the repeal of Roe versus Wadewe'll talk about that in a minute anywayso my point is that this Brandon Strakawhat he's doing is far more importantthan I imagined when I was just readingthe headline about it and I didn't readthe detail once you see his reason thathe realized that Democrats aremanipulating people into this permanentunhealthy unhealthy

this if you want to getmad you know you probably won't get asmad the people who are watching thisperiscope but if you are on the Left letme ask you this do you believe thatChuck Schumer and Nancy

thispresident with the country as they havemade you the voter feel not a chance noteven a slight chance and you know whatyou could tell you could tell just bylooking at them have you ever seen

b6VaQnyRetY,well as a friend of mine once said onceupon a time I was a liberal I'm notquite as good at the smoldery blue-steelsort of stares Brandon is but I'll do mybestwe are raised to be leftist we areraised to be loyal soldiers to theDemocratic Party even when I was in highschool but in public school the historyteacher took the class on an illegaltrip to Cuba to teach about the joys ofsocialism and when they asked him why hewas like oh well I'm a communist youknow of course um you know this schoolthey had no debate Club no civics clubbut there was communism club so you knowit is just impounded in our heads at anearly age I had always been a liberalbut I never really bought into thiswhole collective [ __ ] I was always arebel I was always different even interms of being gay I never felt acceptedby the gay community I never felt like Iwas part of them I always felt judgedand they're mainly all about groupthinkand conformity and looking speakingacting thinking exactly as they do andthat was just never what I was aboutso I guess my red pill story is a littlebit darker than some people's so I guessI'll just say that in summer of 2012 Ihad a home invasion sort of thing and Iwas raped sorry there's weird to talkabout so openlyyou know without going into all thedetails I guess I was living in anapartment in Brooklyn with like fiveroommates and you know they were allleftist activists and all into drugs andone guy who was my roommate at the timewas very closeted and so you know theymoved out and I guess he kept his keysyou know I was there alone five in themorning you know but anyway the point isat the time all of my friends wereradical leftists you know male feministsocial justice warriors rape activiststhe works those are favorite words allthey ever talked about rape rape cultureI hate the term by the way so I reallythought that going to these people likewow they're experts in rape they youknow it's all they talk about that Ireally thought they would support me andhave my back and help me seek justiceand all that that wasn't quite thereception II learned very quickly that when thishappens to a guy nobody wants to hearabout it nobody will let you talk aboutit nobody cares I would try and talkabout I needed to talk about it you knowwith my friends and nobody cared theywould smile nod and immediately changethe subject yet then every moment ofevery day I would be told by them wellimagine how women feel and women have itworse and you know these women theycan't walk down the street without beingraped and you know oh these women theyget raped and it ruins their lives andwomen women when you know it's as ifthey were telling me to just shut upbecause women have it worse I justcouldn't believe the hypocrisy of thesepeople at this time - it was all in thenews about comedians and rape jokes andwanting to ban that so these same peoplethen everyday we're just talking abouthow you know they're protesting somecomedian and rape jokes and rape isnever funny rape is never funny and Ijust thought to myself in that moment Iwas like you know I don't know how Idon't know when but someday I'm gonnafind a way to laugh about what happenedto me just to spite them so it is thistime to that I noticed how politicallycorrect everyone was becoming that youcould not say a word without beingcalled some sort of name this one time Ihad gone on a really awkward date withthis guy where he asked if he could kissme um so when I like told friends aboutthis I wrote a post that you know it'svery unattractive when someone asks tokiss you these same people then jumpdown my throat you're a sexist and youneed affirmative consent and you'readvocating rape you're a rape apologistyou know knowing what I had just gonethrough so this is how they treat peoplethat they claim to champion you know butanyway there were a couple of instancesthat led to my red pill hang so if thatwas the first one the second was thisnow after this happened obviously I hadto get out of that apartment I couldn'tbe there but it was the middle of themonth I know where to go I had no moneyI couldn't find an apartment so I endedup calling some room rental servicewhere you can just move in that day sothey said they had a place super cheapLower East Side in Manhattan greatneighborhood I was like perfect I'lltake it so I show up there with mythingsit's in the projects I lived in theprojects for about a month and a halfnow let me tell you something you cannotlive in the projects for any amount oftime and come out of there illiberalit's not possible I think I was veryignorant as to just how dangerous it wasyou know in retrospect I really don'tknow how I survived especially lookinglike an emaciated albino alien vampirelike I do but I think people don'trealize just how bad the situation is inplaces like that it's bad the peoplethere are so dangerous you knowassaulting people mugging people there'spiss and [ __ ] everywhere and you knowneedles hanging out of their arms andthose are the good ones you know soanyway the woman who I was renting theroom in her apartment she was 26 yearsold for kids from four different fathersmost of them incarcerated and you knowwhen I asked her what do you do she saidI'm in the system as her parents were asher kids will be you know that's thesituation when you are put on welfareyou are meant to stay there so you knowand she would tell me about how like thebuzzwords she would use to get moremoney and if you have more kids you getmore money and you know meanwhile everyday she would come home with shoppingbags of like X boxes and iPads and herTV went from like the floor to theceilingthe thing is though you cannot cannotcannot blame these people they havenever known anything else that you areborn into the system you know whatDemocrats do is that they basically getpeople hooked on drugs the drug of freemoney you know and then they say that ifyou want your fix you have to keepvoting for us I've seen firsthand thedestruction caused by these Democratpolicies and it's bad um you know it'svery frustrating trying to discuss thissubject with liberals about the welfarestate because they are coming from aplace that is theoretical that they'veheard about in a classroom I've livedthis and people do not realize just howtoxic it is and how generational it isand how people are just beingset up for failure it's bad so anyway Ieventually clawed my way out of there Ifound my own place and now I had to dealwith all of these things that hadhappened um you know I'm not gonna lieit was difficult for a long time Ireally struggled and you know I had alot of depression and it was sort of youknow almost like suicidal for a whileyou know I still have a scar on my handfrom all the nights I went to sleepclutching a knife yes I know what you'rethinking yes it changed my views on theSecond Amendment but you know I gotbetter I had to put the work in to bementally well and be healthy and youknow that's my responsibility I'm not avictim with these left it's as if theyencourage emotional instability theywant you to just do in your victimhoodand you can't do that you know we can'thelp the cards were dealt in life wecan't help the things that happen to usbut whether you're a victim or asurvivor is how you handle it is how youplay those cards is what happens after Ieventually got through it and found mystrength and you know and the thing isthe thing that made me feel betterthroughout this time were offensiveoff-color rape jokes I would seek outevery one I could find every comedianand it is the only thing that like gotme over it and these are the things theywant to ban so anyway these things sortof stayed in the back of my mind but Inever really connected the dots betweenthem so a couple of years went by andnow trigger warnings were everywhere youcould not read a news article without atrigger warning especially on thissubject so you know I'd put in all thiswork to be strong and be healthy and bewell-adjusted and now I was being toldthat I'm some sort of victim who is toofragile and too damaged to even read anews article without a warningso anyway I'm a writer so I had a blogat the time that was basically likeshort stories funny things from my lifeand I decided to write a blog about thiswhole experience you know because Iwanted to show a few things I wanted toshow that this happens to men it happensto way more guys than anyone realizes itjust isn't talked about there isn't thesame level of education you know and Ialso want to give a perspective ofstrength and hueand not victimhood you know I wanted toshow that people who have been throughthings like this in their life are toughstrong resilient people we are not thesefragile mentally ill china dolls thatthey'll have you believe and I also wantto call out the hypocrisy of theseactivists so I wrote this blog andwithin 48 hours I had hundreds ofmessages from angry leftists and socialjustice warriors calling me every namein the world you know how dare you writethis how dare you say you're not avictim women have it worse you know howdare you call out these activists whenyou should be thanking them thankingthem that's funny you know telling meI'm making it up my favorite thing thatthey said was that simply by talkingabout how I fought back against myattacker that I am marginalizing andvictimizing anyone who didn't first ofall where do they all learn to talk thesame no they all say the same buzzwordsso according to them I have no ownershipover my life and my story to even talkabout it and this really showed me howliberals treat the people they claim tochampion when one says something thatthey don't want to hear these peoplethey didn't like how I was talking aboutit they want their victims to be cryingand quivering and shaking in a cornerand dependent on them and I was somebodywho's standing tall not crying andsaying I don't need you to triggerwarnings so the thing is if the thingsthat had happened years prior were setoff the little spark in my mind this wasthe tank of gasoline on top of thatbecause this happened right as theelection was heating up it was likeearly 2016 so I'd always been veryinvolved in politics I went to Iowa tocampaign for Obama in 2008 I voted forhim three times all my family areDemocrats so initially I was like okayI'll be for Bernie but then I startedresearching things and realizing waitthis doesn't add up none of this makessense I you know I voted for him veryhalf-heartedly because I didn't knowwhat else to doand then I was like okay I'll be forHillary and then I fell down the rabbithole of research and I found out thehistory of the Democraticand I found out things that I had noclue were going on all this time youknow I've been in a bubble for years ofjust watching MSNBC all day and I wasfinding out things that I had no cluewere happening I didn't know that Obamatook us from two wars to seven wars Ididn't know that his cabinet washandpicked by Citigroup I didn't knowall of these things about the ClintonFoundation all the things with foreigngovernments in Saudi Arabia Morocco andlike all of the corruption all thethings have been going on for so longand we're continuing to go on and thething is all of these things that I wasnow learning were in such contrast towhat I was hearing in the media and fromfriends and people saying oh you justhate her because she's a womanyou know when no that was literally theonly reason I even considered voting forher if you put a moment of thought intoall of the things and think about whatDemocrats ever done for the people ifthey claimed to champion you know evenevery ounce of gay rights that has beenmade the past decade has simply beenundoing Bill Clinton's policies myparents are both cancer survivors andthe cost of their health insurancedoubled and tripled under Obama carethey really got screwed by it but it'sas if it never even occurred to any ofus you don't have to vote Democrat it isso programmed into you from schoolonwards that there are basically twoidentities that you can have in lifeyou're one or the other Democrat or Naziand that doesn't work for me my entirelife I was led to believe that ifsomebody isn't a leftist and isn't aDemocrat that they are just a homophobicracist sexist Nazi and I always believedthat because I had never met anybody inNew York who wasn't a Democrat butduring that summer of 2016I started making new friends and Istarted meeting all of these people whowere conservatives and libertarians andTrump supporters and Republicans and Irealized that they are nothing of thesort that we have most things in commoneven where we disagree and person afterperson that I would meet honestly showedme more kindness and more acceptancethan these liberals ever did andcertainly more than the gay communityever did and it really showed me howwrong these narratives are that areimpounded into our heads so you knowlong story short or not short but longstory long asorry you guys for rambling so um but umanyway I left the Democratic Party and Ibecame very outspoken against the leftbecause I think that these are toxic badregressive ideas that are bringing usbackwards and making every group hateeach other and they need to be activelyfought against especially when you thinkabout how much power they have theycontrol every cultural institution soanyway in doing so I lost all my friendsI lost probably about 90% of my friendsfor me at least it was a thousand timesharder coming out as a centrist againstthe left than it was coming out as gayyou know and then I found people likeDave Rubin and christina hoff sommerspeople who were finally saying thethings that I had been feeling for yearsbut just didn't have the language to beable to identify them as regressiveleftist and that's what they are thething is what Democrats do that is sogenius but so evil is that they fusetheir partisan policies together withpeople's identities so if you don't wantthe Christian Baker to be forced to bakethe gay wedding cakeyou just take gay people if you opposeyou know things like illegal immigrationor the welfare state or whatever youjust hate black people if you don't voteHillary you just hate women and this ishow they are able to control people byinstilling fear if you don't go along ifyou ask questions if you don't justagree with them then you will be thesenames they call you and what I wouldreally say to anybody who is like-mindedthat's afraid to speak out is toremember one thing there's no such thingas an insult something is either true orit is not true so it doesn't matter whatthey call you because a lot of peopleare afraid of being called all thesethings I've been called every name youcan imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jewrape sir for all these things thatthey're supposed to stand for me I'msupposed to be I should have property ofthe DNCtattooed on my ass but you see how theytreat anybody who asks questions anybodywho challenges their dogma it is areligion and what I would really say toanybody who still supports this is whereare things better where is one thingwhere we're better off where is one insince where people are more unified orget along better or anything of the sortI only see negative things what good isthis doing who is this helping and ifnothing maybe it's time to walk away andtry something else so in conclusion Iwould just like to say that I think onething that's really important for us whohave walked away from the left is for usto not then take on the qualities thatwe walked away from to not buy intogroupthink and tribalism I think it isincumbent on all of us to improve theright and it improved the RepublicanParty and take back the center so anywaythank you guys so much for listening andsorry for my long ramblings but anywayyou know as a Russian bot in conclusionI will just saydosvedanya hey guys just wanted to addthis as a PS as I said I'm a writer andI've created a TV show that is basicallya walk away perspective of being gay andsingle and it's a very critical look atthis conformist post modernist gaycommunity I'm a little bit afraid I'llbe blacklisted for speaking out againstthem and I've already been told it'soffensive you'd never see a show likethis in the mainstream so if you likewhat I have to say and that's a show youwould like to see I'm gonna leave a linkto the Kickstarter or check it outcigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarteralright sorry this video so long thankyou so much for listening hit me up onthe social medias if you'd likeyouwell as a friend of

like that it's bad the peoplethere are so dangerous you knowassaulting people mugging people there'spiss and [ __ ] everywhere and you knowneedles hanging out of their arms andthose are the good ones you know soanyway the woman who I was renting theroom in her apartment she was 26 yearsold for kids from four different fathersmost of them incarcerated and you knowwhen I asked her what do you do she saidI'm in the system as her parents were asher kids will be you know that's thesituation when you are put on welfareyou are meant to stay there so you knowand she would tell me about how like thebuzzwords she would use to get moremoney and if you have more kids you getmore money and you know meanwhile everyday she would come home with shoppingbags of like X boxes and iPads and herTV went from like the floor to theceilingthe thing is though you cannot cannotcannot blame these people they havenever known anything else that you areborn into the system you know whatDemocrats do is that they basically getpeople hooked on drugs the drug of freemoney you know and then they say that ifyou want your fix you have to keepvoting for us I've seen firsthand thedestruction caused by these Democratpolicies and it's bad um you know it'svery frustrating trying to discuss thissubject with liberals about the welfarestate because they are coming from aplace that is theoretical that they'veheard about in a classroom I've livedthis and people do not realize just howtoxic it is and how generational it isand how people are just beingset up for failure it's bad so anyway Ieventually clawed my way out of there Ifound my own place and now I had to dealwith all of these things that hadhappened um you know I'm not gonna lieit was difficult for a long time Ireally struggled and you know I had alot of depression and it was sort of youknow almost like suicidal for a whileyou know I still have a scar on my handfrom all the nights I went to sleepclutching a knife yes I know what you'rethinking yes it changed my views on theSecond Amendment but you know I gotbetter I had to put the work in to bementally well and be healthy and youknow that's my responsibility I'm not avictim with these left it's as if theyencourage emotional instability theywant you to just do in your victimhoodand you can't do that you know we can'thelp the cards were dealt in life wecan't help the things that happen to usbut whether you're a victim or asurvivor is how you handle it is how youplay those cards is what happens after Ieventually got through it and found mystrength and you know and the thing isthe thing that made me feel betterthroughout this time were offensiveoff-color rape jokes I would seek outevery one I could find every comedianand it is the only thing that like gotme over it and these are the things theywant to ban so anyway these things sortof stayed in the back of my mind but Inever really connected the dots betweenthem so a couple of years went by andnow trigger warnings were everywhere youcould not read a news article without atrigger warning especially on thissubject so you know I'd put in all thiswork to be strong and be healthy and bewell-adjusted and now I was being toldthat I'm some sort of victim who is toofragile and too damaged to even read anews article without a warningso anyway I'm a writer so I had a blogat the time that was basically likeshort stories funny things from my lifeand I decided to write a blog about thiswhole experience you know because Iwanted to show a few things I wanted toshow that this happens to men it happensto way more guys than anyone realizes itjust isn't talked about there isn't thesame level of education you know and Ialso want to give a perspective ofstrength and hueand not victimhood you know I wanted toshow that people who have been throughthings like this in their life are toughstrong resilient people we are not thesefragile mentally ill china dolls thatthey'll have you believe and I also wantto call out the hypocrisy of theseactivists so I wrote this blog andwithin 48 hours I had hundreds ofmessages from angry leftists and socialjustice warriors calling me every namein the world you know how dare you writethis how dare you say you're not avictim women have it worse you know howdare you call out these activists whenyou should be thanking them thankingthem that's funny you know telling meI'm making it up my favorite thing thatthey said was that simply by talkingabout how I fought back against myattacker that I am marginalizing andvictimizing anyone who didn't first ofall where do they all learn to talk thesame no they all say the same buzzwordsso according to them I have no ownershipover my life and my story to even talkabout it and this really showed me howliberals treat the people they claim tochampion when one says something thatthey don't want to hear these peoplethey didn't like how I was talking aboutit they want their victims to be cryingand quivering and shaking in a cornerand dependent on them and I was somebodywho's standing tall not crying andsaying I don't need you to triggerwarnings so the thing is if the thingsthat had happened years prior were setoff the little spark in my mind this wasthe tank of gasoline on top of thatbecause this happened right as theelection was heating up it was likeearly 2016 so I'd always been veryinvolved in politics I went to Iowa tocampaign for Obama in 2008 I voted forhim three times all my family areDemocrats so initially I was like okayI'll be for Bernie but then I startedresearching things and realizing waitthis doesn't add up none of this makessense I you know I voted for him veryhalf-heartedly because I didn't knowwhat else to doand then I was like okay I'll be forHillary and then I fell down the rabbithole of research and I found out thehistory of the Democraticand I found out things that I had noclue were going on all this time youknow I've been in a bubble for years ofjust watching MSNBC all day and I wasfinding out things that I had no cluewere happening I didn't know that Obamatook us from two wars to seven wars Ididn't know that his cabinet washandpicked by Citigroup I didn't knowall of these things about the ClintonFoundation all the things with foreigngovernments in Saudi Arabia Morocco andlike all of the corruption all thethings have been going on for so longand we're continuing to go on and thething is all of these things that I wasnow learning were in such contrast towhat I was hearing in the media and fromfriends and people saying oh you justhate her because she's a womanyou know when no that was literally theonly reason I even considered voting forher if you put a moment of thought intoall of the things and think about whatDemocrats ever done for the people ifthey claimed to champion you know evenevery ounce of gay rights that has beenmade the past decade has simply beenundoing Bill Clinton's policies myparents are both cancer survivors andthe cost of their health insurancedoubled and tripled under Obama carethey really got screwed by it but it'sas if it never even occurred to any ofus you don't have to vote Democrat it isso programmed into you from schoolonwards that there are basically twoidentities that you can have in lifeyou're one or the other Democrat or Naziand that doesn't work for me my entirelife I was led to believe that ifsomebody isn't a leftist and isn't aDemocrat that they are just a homophobicracist sexist Nazi and I always believedthat because I had never met anybody inNew York who wasn't a Democrat butduring that summer of 2016I started making new friends and Istarted meeting all of these people whowere conservatives and libertarians andTrump supporters and Republicans and Irealized that they are nothing of thesort that we have most things in commoneven where we disagree and person afterperson that I would meet honestly showedme more kindness and more acceptancethan these liberals ever did andcertainly more than the gay communityever did and it really showed me howwrong these narratives are that areimpounded into our heads so you knowlong story short or not short but longstory long asorry you guys for rambling so um but umanyway I left the Democratic Party and Ibecame very outspoken against the leftbecause I think that these are toxic badregressive ideas that are bringing usbackwards and making every group hateeach other and they need to be activelyfought against especially when you thinkabout how much power they have theycontrol every cultural institution soanyway in doing so I lost all my friendsI lost probably about 90% of my friendsfor me at least it was a thousand timesharder coming out as a centrist againstthe left than it was coming out as gayyou know and then I found people likeDave Rubin and christina hoff sommerspeople who were finally saying thethings that I had been feeling for yearsbut just didn't have the language to beable to identify them as regressiveleftist and that's what they are thething is what Democrats do that is sogenius but so evil is that they fusetheir partisan policies together withpeople's identities so if you don't wantthe Christian Baker to be forced to bakethe gay wedding cakeyou just take gay people if you opposeyou know things like illegal immigrationor the welfare state or whatever youjust hate black people if you don't voteHillary you just hate women and this ishow they are able to control people byinstilling fear if you don't go along ifyou ask questions if you don't justagree with them then you will be thesenames they call you and what I wouldreally say to anybody who is like-mindedthat's afraid to speak out is toremember one thing there's no such thingas an insult something is either true orit is not true so it doesn't matter whatthey call you because a lot of peopleare afraid of being called all thesethings I've been called every name youcan imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jewrape sir for all these things thatthey're supposed to stand for me I'msupposed to be I should have property ofthe DNCtattooed on my ass but you see how theytreat anybody who asks questions anybodywho challenges their dogma it is areligion and what I would really say toanybody who still supports this is whereare things better where is one thingwhere we're better off where is one insince where people are more unified orget along better or anything of the sortI only see negative things what good isthis doing who is this helping and ifnothing maybe it's time to walk away andtry something else so in conclusion Iwould just like to say that I think onething that's really important for us whohave walked away from the left is for usto not then take on the qualities thatwe walked away from to not buy intogroupthink and tribalism I think it isincumbent on all of us to improve theright and it improved the RepublicanParty and take back the center so anywaythank you guys so much for listening andsorry for my long ramblings but anywayyou know as a Russian bot in conclusionI will just saydosvedanya hey guys just wanted to addthis as a PS as I said I'm a writer andI've created a TV show that is basicallya walk away perspective of being gay andsingle and it's a very critical look atthis conformist post modernist gaycommunity I'm a little bit afraid I'llbe blacklisted for speaking out againstthem and I've already been told it'soffensive you'd never see a show likethis in the mainstream so if you likewhat I have to say and that's a show youwould like to see I'm gonna leave a linkto the Kickstarter or check it outcigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarteralright sorry this video so long thankyou so much for listening hit me up onthe social medias if you'd likeyouwell as a friend of mine once said onceupon a time I was a liberal I'm notquite as good at the smoldery blue-steelsort of stares Brandon is but I'll do mybestwe are raised to be leftist we areraised to be loyal soldiers to theDemocratic Party even when I was in highschool but in public school the historyteacher took the class on an illegaltrip to Cuba to teach about the joys ofsocialism and when they asked him why hewas like oh well I'm a communist youknow of course um you know this schoolthey had no debate Club no civics clubbut there was communism club so you knowit is just impounded in our heads at anearly age I had always been a liberalbut I never really bought into thiswhole collective [ __ ] I was always arebel I was always different even interms of being gay I never felt acceptedby the gay community I never felt like Iwas part of them I always felt judgedand they're mainly all about groupthinkand conformity and looking speakingacting thinking exactly as they do andthat was just never what I was aboutso I guess my red pill story is a littlebit darker than some people's so I guessI'll just say that in summer of 2012 Ihad a home invasion sort of thing and Iwas raped sorry there's weird to talkabout so openlyyou know without going into all thedetails I guess I was living in anapartment in Brooklyn with like fiveroommates and you know they were allleftist activists and all into drugs andone guy who was my roommate at the timewas very closeted and so you know theymoved out and I guess he kept his keysyou know I was there alone five in themorning you know but anyway the point isat the time all of my friends wereradical leftists you know male feministsocial justice warriors rape activiststhe works those are favorite words allthey ever talked about rape rape cultureI hate the term by the way so I reallythought that going to these people likewow they're experts in rape they youknow it's all they talk about that Ireally thought they would support me andhave my back and help me seek justiceand all that that wasn't quite thereception II learned very quickly that when thishappens to a guy nobody wants to hearabout it nobody will let you talk aboutit nobody cares I would try and talkabout I needed to talk about it you knowwith my friends and nobody cared theywould smile nod and immediately changethe subject yet then every moment ofevery day I would be told by them wellimagine how women feel and women have itworse and you know these women theycan't walk down the street without beingraped and you know oh these women theyget raped and it ruins their lives andwomen women when you know it's as ifthey were telling me to just shut upbecause women have it worse I justcouldn't believe the hypocrisy of thesepeople at this time - it was all in thenews about comedians and rape jokes andwanting to ban that so these same peoplethen everyday we're just talking abouthow you know they're protesting somecomedian and rape jokes and rape isnever funny rape is never funny and Ijust thought to myself in that moment Iwas like you know I don't know how Idon't know when but someday I'm gonnafind a way to laugh about what happenedto me just to spite them so it is thistime to that I noticed how politicallycorrect everyone was becoming that youcould not say a word without beingcalled some sort of name this one time Ihad gone on a really awkward date withthis guy where he asked if he could kissme um so when I like told friends aboutthis I wrote a post that you know it'svery unattractive when someone asks tokiss you these same people then jumpdown my throat you're a sexist and youneed affirmative consent and you'readvocating rape you're a rape apologistyou know knowing what I had just gonethrough so this is how they treat peoplethat they claim to champion you know butanyway there were a couple of instancesthat led to my red pill hang so if thatwas the first one the second was thisnow after this happened obviously I hadto get out of that apartment I couldn'tbe there but it was the middle of themonth I know where to go I had no moneyI couldn't find an apartment so I endedup calling some room rental servicewhere you can just move in that day sothey said they had a place super cheapLower East Side in Manhattan greatneighborhood I was like perfect I'lltake it so I show up there with mythingsit's in the projects I lived in theprojects for about a month and a halfnow let me tell you something you cannotlive in the projects for any amount oftime and come out of there illiberalit's not possible I think I was veryignorant as to just how dangerous it wasyou know in retrospect I really don'tknow how I survived especially lookinglike an emaciated albino alien vampirelike I do but I think people don'trealize just how bad the situation is inplaces like that it's bad the peoplethere are so dangerous you knowassaulting people mugging people there'spiss and [ __ ] everywhere and you knowneedles hanging out of their arms andthose are the good ones you know
