hello my walk away brothers and sistersmy name is wayne fisher i live justoutside of reading pennsylvaniabeing from pennsylvania and having livedhere for over 20 yearsi was very proud to see thatpennsylvania put president trump overthe electoral college votes that heneeded to win the 2016 electionum as long as i've lived here i've neverseen this state go redso it was fantastic to see umi shared a walk away written testimonialback in august but with brandon askingfor more videos i decided i would try toput one togetheri apologize if it's a little awkwardbecause i don't usually do videosbut i wanted to put one together todayumfirst i wanted to thank brandon becausethis movement has beenfantastic i learned about it a littleover a year agobut just didn't take the time to toreally look into itbut back in august when i did i startedreading some of the testimonials fromyou guysand watching the videos and it wasamazing umi have gotten so much inspiration fromyou guys and everything that you guysput out thereum you know i was a registered democratfor years although i will say that ididn'tvote party i usually voted for thecandidate that i thought was going to dothe best jobi am middle-aged so i've been voting forquite a whilevoted for george bush i bought intothe idea of change with barack obamaand voted for him twice uh regrettablybecause at the end ofhis term i watched the economy tank iwatchedjobs leave i watched his hatred of thecountryof our police force and our freedomsbecameum attackedunder his administration so umeven through all that i truly felt theneed to walk awayshortly after trump announced hiscandidacyum i got to watch the leftshow its intolerance in forceum any questioning or disagreement withtheir um policies or proceduresor their uh goalsit was just met with bullying andintimidation andtrying to silence any other voice thatdared to think for themselves ordisagree with themso um you know it became more and moreevident thatuh the liberal progressivedemocrats hated meum you know i feel like to them i'm oneof the fiveworst things or five of the worst thingsyou can be in this country right nowyou know i'm white and i'm male firstso you know white means that i'm racisti'm privileged i'm supremacisteven though i can't change the color ofmy skin that's what i am to themuh i'm male so i'm misogynistor i am toxically masculine whateverthat meansum you know three four and five i'mheterosexual i'm christian and i'mmiddle agedso i must be homophobic orintolerant um hateful due to mygenerationmy faith and my sexual orientationthose also contribute to hatefulnessapparently andi just found out you can't say sexualpreferencebecause that is a judgmental term solearned that this past week um you knowi've been told that i'veuneducated i've been told that by peoplewho didn't know meby people who knew me even thoughand they knew my character they'vecalled me a lot of these wordsbased on our arguments just trying tosilence mebut the more they tried the more vocal ibecame in thisso um one of the things that i shared afew days ago on my facebook page wassome of the similarities and storiesthat i'd seenon this walk away page and they reallystruck meand as we're getting into the last weekand a half going toward electioni thought that it might be somethingthat's that's worth talking aboutso you know i look at a lot of storiesand a lot of people were taught thatrepublicans were for the rich and thedemocrats were for the working classand if you look now you can see howrepublicans are working forthat working class the parties aren'tthe same as what they used to be or whatthey were thought to beum a lot of people just like me votedfor obamaand did so purely because he was blackin a lot of casesand felt he could bring about someracial unity which justdidn't happen um you know a lot ofpeople hated trump in 2016and you read a lot of these stories andpeople either abstained from votingor voted for the libertarian candidatethey knew they couldn't vote for hillaryandthey like he said abstained or voted forthe libertarian candidateand these votes went to neither thedemocrats nor the republicansso it's great to see that they're comingfor trump this timeonce people were locked down from covetit's amazing to see how people startedto do their own researchand what they learned and really startedtowatch what the president was sayingversus what was being reportedand so many people who thought the ideaof fake news wasjust a talking point sawwhat the fake news is really gettingaway withthey're no longer reporting stories theyarereporting their opinions to us andtrying to get usswayed to their opinions umyou know people started recognizing thehypocrisy andyou know i started to see peoplerecognizing the hypocrisyand the political wrangling aroundthis virus umhow it became an excuse to take awaysome of our freedoms and still isin a lot of cases umit's encouraging to see that lawsuitsare already being won by businessesthat are standing up against what theirstate governments didand again a lot of cases these aredemocratic state governmentsand just the continuedmeans of trying to control us throughthisis very disheartening peoplesaw the riots and the lawlessness thatfor monthswent unaddressed by the democrats and itwas a huge eye-openerbiden and the harris administrationwouldn't evenacknowledge them until it started tohurt their poll numbersand you know this is about our citizenryand protectingthe people um you know there's so manypeople like i did that experiencedhatredand vitriol from friends upon statingtheir support forpresident trump um even people who knewlike i said even in my case that knew mefor years sothe left has adopted a strategy ofbullying and intimidationto silence the conservatives so that wewould have a fear of reprisalso it helped to create a real silentmajorityum i saw many lgbtq storieson the walk away site stating thatcoming out as a trump supporter was evenharder thancoming out as gay or umwhatever place they fall on that scalei'm sorry i know that sounded awkwardi'm sorry soum but i the one thing that reallystruck me is most peoplefeel like they didn't leave the partythe party left them andand i would agree with thatwholeheartedly so umthis election is absolutely for the soulof our countryand we need to get out there and we needtovote end mass for president trumpand we need a red wave at every level inthe senatein the house in state government we needto support our presidentit's definitely the future of ourcountryand again i thank brandon for thismovementi thank all of you for sharing yourstories i hope that minetouched somebody as well so god blesspresident trumpgod bless the usa god bless all of youyou
hi Barbara millions of us would like toknow why are you and many other blackswalking away from the Democrats let'shear your testimony well it's about timethat we awaken from the slumber thatthey have put us into and they use theschool system they use the fact that wemany of us come from broken homes theyuse the media they use Hollyweird inevery place to influence black people tokeep them in office and in power yeswhile their communities are crumblingcommunities that the Democrats arecontrolling up front they're gettingricher and richer by the electionthey don't want to get out of officebecause that's their bread and that'stheir butter and they forget about theirconstituentswhy didn't I work and walk away youcan't grow up in a church taught aboutGod who says love thy neighborand then stick be loyalwhy I say thathate the basementremember slavery but I also rememberthat God allowed it and if I love GodI have to be like Joseph mm-hmm and saywhat man meant for evil God meant forgood mm-hmm because the good of it is Iam an American citizen I didn't have toleave my mother my father my cousin's myand come to America for freedomI was born in the freest country thatthere is why I walked away because Ifelt controlled by people who use theonly at election time more on thetelevision telling you that theRepublicans are for the rich telling youthat the Republicans are racist tellingyou telling you telling you to keep themin office so they can get richer andpoor people can get fourI came to the conclusion that they werebeing selfish they will beeven when they said that old peopleeating dog food I realize that that wasa lie way back when because cat food anddog food is expensive oh boy expensivelitter and spam Oh tuna that's rightbut so I came to the conclusionthen I was following linesI was a faithful member and it'smentioned in my book escaping the racismof low expectationsi gauge of the conclusionand I was being lied toI came to the conclusion that I can'tserve God and he did whitening mostlyI came colorful powerful that I wantedto be mentally free right and think formyself right I tell people don't youRudolph Giulianiwhy against david dinkins because Ithought he'd be better for New York thenmy scope broad I said who would be thebest friend for Americayeah so that's why I walked awaydeceit delusional dust will spread overmy brain like so many blacks stillwalking around with that gunthat gives them no placebut in the state of hating people for nocalling people racist when they don'thave any evidenceyou have to be slow functionlow functioning or purposely ignoringthe truth to continue on that path ofdeception what's best for America that'sright what's most pleasing to God onthis country and it is walking away fromthoughdown with killing up with killingmaintenance move on no course only thelaw yeah people who have illegally comehere sanctuarywhen citizens have no sanctuary right noI couldn't continue on that panelI didn't continueand I'm so happy that now I can trulysay free at last free at last thank GodAlmightyI'm freaky
hi I'm grace this is my walk away videoI'm walking away from the DemocraticParty because I believe they electedTrump I think they did this bymanipulating identity politics to theiradvantage without realizing that thecountry was tired of identity politicsso when Trump became president I had toknow why I hated the disgusted me I wasin shock and denial I had to know whyand I was actually curious unlike a lotof my liberal friends who did the easything and assumed that half of theUnited States is racist I thought thatwas possible but I really did want toknow why he was my president so insteadof radicalizing to the movement of he'snot my president I stepped back a littlebit because I had I was curious Istarted researching I started listeningto everything I could and all thedifferent news sources even Fox News Iknow and listening to academics onYouTube trying to figure out why thishappened and what I found was thatpeople were I would people were tired ofidentity politics I mean they were tiredof the left always talking aboutpeople's race or racism always talkingabout people's sex or sexism alwaystalking about all of the ist's and as ifit were happening everywhere all thetime it was just a buzz thing it waslike manipulating it manipulating thelatest trend to get your platformessentially because what I what Istarted to see when I actually didresearch was things don't get betterwhen the Democrats are in office it'snot like the ghettos are getting betterquite the opposite ends up being true soI started actually thinking aboutpolitics in general and I started towell I don't think ever had a gray agreatgrasp on politics I did the party lineyou know I I'm a person who loves peopleand I think people should have rights soI'll vote Democrats I mean most of usare pretty stupid and I think theDemocratic Party knows that and I thinkwith the Republican Party knows that toobut um anyway I learned a lot aboutpolitics I learned about a lot aboutgovernment in economics and and then Irealized wow I started seeing radicalradicalizing you know left's leftistsgetting violent organizing in groupsthat promote violence it's so andsuddenly I realized oh maybe I'm not onmaybe there isn't a good side and badside maybe both sides can be corrupt andyou know I'm exhausted by identitypolitics too I hate the idea that youhave to be a woman why can't I be ahuman you know I am woman but it's notlike I have to walk up to people andthat's what I expect you to see and youknow liberals expect people to see whenwhen you see someone you have to seewhat color are they what gender are theyare they gay I know I need to know Imean they might know more than I dobecause there's this hierarchy ofoppression I mean here's the Orthodoxdoctrine there's a hierarchy ofoppression I need to know where you'reat because if I'm more impressed thanyou are then what I say holds moreweight if you're more oppressed than Iam I yield to what you say as true it'sif you think about it it is ridiculouswhy can't we be human why can't we beAmericans why can't we be those thingsfirstespecially when it's related to politicsand economics and business andgovernment and so I started to see thatthat this this boogeyman all right wassmaller than people on the Left made itout to be and here's how I know becausethe second that illiberal questionsidentity politics or questionsdemocratic policy they're alrightthey're being called out right eventhough they're not and then I started torealize that all right is this hugeboogeyman that's actually way smallerlike the actual racist the actual bigotsthey are a pretty small group I thinkbecause if you don't conform to theorthodoxy you're out I lost a lot offriends Oh most of my friends at thispoint of my life I spent a coupledecades in academia and liberal circlesI mean I led the rally I led the waylet's just say that I converted morepeople to feminism you know so the pointis you question one thing and suddenlyyour friends are radio silent and you'reon the outside and they just cannotbelieve that you've turned into a thricethis horrible human beingit's like it makes you step back furtherand go what the hell is happening and itmakes you not want to participate in itbecause you recognize that as the equalopposite of the all right the when Trumpbecame president the girls started toradicalize and they're going on theextreme and turning into some kind ofcrazy out leftI mean organizing into violent groupsit's like totally unacceptable to me soI I still have liberal values but I amNOT a Democrat I might not even be aliberal I might not even be willing tocall myself a liberal anymore based onwhat I'm seeing and based on how I'mbeing treated by liberals frankly andI'm starting to see if these violentliberals get into government well firstthey're all for communism and socialismso well there goes the United States ofAmerica but second I don't want thosepeople having big government I thoughtthere might be a group of good people ifwe had big government it would be greatand maybe they'd bring in the Utopia Noyou know maybe I am a conservative maybeI don't want big government so I'mstarting to think those thoughts youknow now that I'm freed from liberalfriends who have no good argumentbecause they're not talking I can actwe start thinking about those things soI'm leaving the Democratic Party
hey guysuh my name is paulie letofsky and i havebeenfollowing brandon and walk away in facti give to himand his patreon account every month soi've been a big fan been watching allyour videosfrankly never even occurred to me to domy own i don't know why i thought mystory wasn'tum dramatic enough or whatever buthe put out a plea today to post yourvideos and iand i promised that i would so i guesshere's my uh walk awaylong time ago now i'm a walk with okaysoi i was a democrat grew up inin the liberal cesspool of americaminneapolisin the liberal family love them but iam the black sheep andthen i just thought that you knowdemocrats were nice peopleand republicans were mean i guessthat's kind of what i've been hearingall across your videos too and that'svery much my storyso as i went through my life i lived inbig cities now please forgive me but ilived in bostonand i remember going out to rally forted kennedyoh my god please forgive me but thenmichael dukakisoh it's just horrible soi live you would think by mybio that i would be a liberalgrowing up in minneapolis living incitiesi am in a creative field which generallyis liberal i'm in the publishing worldi am a single woman i've never beenmarried i don't have kidsso those are all sort of traitsfor being a liberal so no one would everguess i'm not necessarily religiousnothing like that so a half jewish halflutheransi got liberal written all over me but noi mean honestly if i would have taken atestprobably when i was six i probably wouldhave said you knowyou're a republican you're conservativebecause i've had these same values but ijustthey were misplaced so that's what i amso i had this dream my whole lifeto go walk around the world when i was12 growing up in minneapolisi read a story of a guy that when walkedaround the world and i'm like oh i wantto go do that that's how i wanted to goexplore the world but when i was 12 itwas 1974 and 12 and you just12 year old girls don't grow up and gowalk around the world so it was kind ofthishidden dream of mine and i tucked itinside my head and went on with my lifebutthat had triggered something and ialways wanted to go walk around theworldso as i moved around from the cities tothe cities and all these creative jobsthat are filled with liberalsi always had questions certainly abouttheiryou know their liberal policies but ididn't know enough ihadn't been you know woke yet but anywayin the meantime at the age of 37i just sold all my belongingsand got my world together to in fact golive this dream to go walk around theworld so that is my claim to fame i'mthe first woman to go walk around theworld umso i was walking and i started in vailcoloradoand i headed west and i wentthrough the western u.s of course fromla then i went down through new zealandup through australiaand and into southeast asia singaporeand in through malaysia and by now i'vebeen on the road for two plusyears when i walked into malaysiaand malaysia was a game changerin my life in my political world how isaw theworld and everything elsei was in malaysia during september 112001and i remember the day i rememberexactly of course where i was ii actually was staying at this somepeople were putting me up at a hoteland and this is before cell phones andall this this is 2001.so uh we had internet butit wasn't as of course as big a deal asit is now but i remember i went on tocnn they had a little internet cafe inthein the um atrium of the hotel so i gotontocnn.com that night the night well it was9 11in malaysia but it was umearly 911 in americaand i just happened to notice the timein the upper left-hand corner cnn.comthat's when cnn was actuallyreputable so uhi remember so clearly looking at all thestories and going okay well nothing of alife-changing nature has happened in theworld so i canyou know i always wanted to kind of keepup with what was going on in the worldbecause i'm heading into a very muslimworldand i looked in the upper left handcorner of cnn and it said8 45 a.m september 11thand that was new york timewell nothing of a world-changing eventhas taken place so i'll just go to bedso i go to bed i'm sleeping when all the9 11 stuff happensand because of the time difference itwas exactly 12 hours differencei wake up the next morning and all thesepeople that were coming to walk with mewithout going into all the detailthe lions clubs and rotary clubs wouldsort of pass me village to village andcome walk with me and stuff like thatso um they were all meeting me at thishoteland they they were saying well do youstill want to walk today do you knowwhat's going on and i'm likei don't know what you're talking aboutand they tried to explain to me inin their language that you know aboutthe hijackers and theycrash into the building the buildingsfall down andand i couldn't understand themso i called my dad in la right there onthe spot i said what is going on outthereby now it's 9 11 l.a timei said what is going on so he tells mewhat's going onand that set my walk and my life offinto a differenttrajectory altogether that morningso lisa do you still want to walk or doyou want toum take the day off what do you want todo and i said well let's continue towalk but if you guys could help me finda place to stay tonight that has cnnand uh internet access remember it's2001 early daysof online access they said okay so wecontinue to walkand they do they find me a place to staynow as i look back and i look back atall thisum you know when you look back and youcan seeall the the dot to dots and stuff likethat andand uh it starts to make sense or youstart to marvelat certain things i was gone for a totalof five yearswalking around the world for five yearsso how many days is that it's like 1800plus plus daysright the only night everthat i stayed with a muslim family wasthe night of 9 11.they found a family that was a muslimfamily but it was muslim by default ifyou willokay because if you marry a muslim youhave to become muslimand if if uhyou give birth to someone like uhif if you were chinese and they weremuslimnow you're both muslim and you givebirth to babies that are muslim sothis was like all by default the motherwas actually chinese and the man wasactually tamil indianbut they were muslim by default so theyyou know they had threegrown kids and and umthey had shipped them off to australiato get their educationand they said these two people theygreeted me into their homeand they said i understand you wantinternet access and cnn andjust get caught up and i said yeahthat'd be great they said i'm so sorrybut we have plans for tonightbut we'll we're gonna cut it short butwe're gonna just run outand um in the meantime we're just gonnaplunk you here in front of cnnand we'll be right back well theirmother was nextto me and she was a muslim woman withthe whole headdresseverything so her and i couldn't talk toeach other we're both sitting side bysidestaring at cnn trying to unravel whathad happened that dayand it's still 9 11 but it's 9 11 latenight malaysia timeand in the u.s now is september 12th sothey had been living with this for 24hoursdoes that make sense soum they came back and i hadit was really the start of a gamechanger in my life i sat and chattedwith them again they're muslim bydefaultright i remember so clearly sittingat their dinner tableand it now seems like a really weirdconversationbut i want you to take yourself back to2001and we didn't know what we know nowabout islam and about how they hateamericaand all this stuff so i sat at thisdinner table with them and i saidwell i don't understand how you'remuslim by default why can't you just notbe muslim because they were veryembarrassedby their religion they didn't want to bemuslim i was like well i don't get itright am i all american free to bewhoever the heck you want to bekind of you know mindset i'm like whycan't you just not be muslimand they were saying you can't do thatyou knowshe was you know born into it becauseher fatherwas muslim and married their mother andyou know all thethe whole story and then so she's muslimand wanted to marry him who's a tamilindian so now he's muslimand they're explaining that no you can'tjust not be muslim once muslimyou're always muslim and they wereworried about their kidsand their kids are grown and they'reliving in australia why are you worriedabout them they're in australiait's not they like they look muslim orlook middle eastern andremember the first day we didn't evenknow what was really going onthey said well we're worried about thembecause if they were to be asked theywould have to tell the truth about thatthey're reallymuslim so i didn't get any of this andwe just had this real blood conversationand uh he was saying that muslims don'tdrink andyou know but we're bad muslims and i'mgonna drink a beer and this kind ofthingso it was a real game changer because itgave mereally genuine insight as to what itmeans when we saywe live in a free country what does freemeanwhat is freedom of religion in americafreedom of religioni now know because of that whole episodefreedom of religionmeans you don't have to be with thereligion of your parentsyou can be born lutheran turn jewishand then get divorced and make up yourownreligion and be whoever you want to bein your friends will throw you a partyforfinding yourselfand that is really almost nowhere elsei mean there are other free countries inthe world but there's nothinglike american freedomanother big game changer in that wholemalaysianow just in case anyone asked you ittakes two months to walk upthrough the south end to the north endof malaysia so i was there for twomonths and it happened to bethrough um mid august tomid-october 2001. so right in a very biggame changingkind of timeline incertainly american history and worldhistoryso the lions clubs and the rotary clubswere helping methey were sort of you know passing mevillage to village and walking with meand etctaking really good care of me and i wasdoing it for breast cancer so there werethere's breast cancer fundraising andadvocacy work and stuff like that lotsofinterviews and press and things likethisand the lions clubs were primarily okaywell let me back up there's three majorum races if you will inin malaysia there's the muslims themalaysthe malaysians the muslims and then thechinese which are buddhistand then the indians tamil indians okayand they're hinduso there's the three major racistreligionsthere and i mean seriously i was likeforrest gump out there there werehundreds of people walking with me everyday and they were almostexclusively the chineseand the indiansand what i discoveredis that if you aremuslim then you go down to theequivalent of the dmv and you signsomething off that said yes you are apracticing muslimdoesn't care if you're chinese orwhatever if you are a practicing muslimthen you are now malaysian and thereforeyou getall these different benefits in lifemeaning you get social um you get thesocialprograms so um you would get youryour children get free education highereducationum you can own land and you can getlet's say unemployment things like thatright all you gotta do is go down to thedmv and i'm making that up because idon't know what it is but it's theequivalent of the dmv and you sign offand then you get all these thingsokay but if you don't sign off then youarenot malaysian even though of you arechinese of chinese descent for yearsokayyears decades you're still chineseyou're notvery different in america right you comeinto america you're an americanso that was one weird thing okay what ialso sawthough is these chinese and indians thatwere walking with meevery day all day they were hard workinghard working because they didn't haveany social backupthey didn't have the safety nets thatthe malays dothe muslims okay so i'm watching thisand i'm watching every town we're goingthroughby the way it's like i think it's like60to 70 percent malaysian racethat is there and then the other 30 40is made up of the otherraces and it's really that 30 to 40percentof the chinese and the indians that areworking they're the ones workingand that's what i saw i mean i saw itwith my own two eyeballsthey're the ones working so essentiallywhat i am watchingday by day foot step by foot step talkabout ground level stuffis i am seeing two societies living sideby sideone is a socialist country and one isfree market and they were side by sidewho was working who was getting educatedit was the chinese and the indians thatwere going to schooland they would raise their kids and shipthem off to say australiathe us the uk to get educated thatwas a game changer to see that twosocieties livingside by side that is malaysia and what ihaven't stayed up oni don't know i haven't stayed up on thefact that um if everyone is going toraise their kids and ship them out wellwho is in fact going to be doing thework right if the malays in fact they'renot going to be doing the work do yousee what i meanso that was a big old game changer andthat 11 happened during thistime of course and there was that funkymonth between when 9 11 happened andthen whenthe world the allies actually went towar and they went to warthe day before i actually crossed frommalaysiainto the thai border and thailand's adifferent storyso as i continued my walk i was notquite halfway around at that point so asi continued my next two and a half yearsi am watching as the world is changingand ireally started to become politicallywokei started reading papers and i meanpodcasts didn't exist yetuh it was even difficult to get anewspaper buti would try to get them and i juststarted asking questions to myself andagainyou know i didn't there wasn'tsmartphones or anything yetum but i just started asking questionsand looking and asking for answersand observing it was just a lot ofobservingtoo uh you're observing differentcultures as you're going around you knowit's likeum thailand is one kind of culture it'svery free market trade we have a goodrelationship with themthen over into india different entirelyum then up through turkey and europeand i'm just seeing all these changesand i reallybecame a republicanafter um let me see i arrived three anda half yearsafter i'd started i arrived back intothe united states on the east coastand i had a whole newuh vision and idea and understanding ofwhat america is what it means to theworld mean it means to the history ofthe world why people were fighting forfreedom what freedom really meansi got it i got it and i started to seeof course as icontinued my walklike all these people that risked livesto get to america and why it's becauseof these systems rightso they get to america and they havetheir freedom and they build and theybuild andum so then i arrive back into the u.sand i see it withfresh new eyes and i see it through theeyes of theimmigrants that came inand i just started thinking you knowit's certainly worth fighting forso once i got back into america andthere was still another year and a halfto walk from new york to coloradoum but i started listeningto um glenn beckum sean hannity i started listening torush limbaugh and i justthey made sense to me and i was likethat's it that i get itthat's where i have been frankly since iwas a kidbut i couldn't put a sort of a face toit and i was like wow i'm really arepublicanso i i finished my walk and i thinkmy mom god love her you know she'sfabulous and all butum she's liberal she's not left-wingshe's liberal she's um you can have achat with her but you know umwhen people when people ask her wasn'tit scary to have your daughter outwalking in the world by herselfum she says well the scariest thing isshe came back a republicanbut i really you know again saw theworld through different eyesand i remember when i was coming backinto the u.s and mom hadrealized i was getting so much supportall around the world and she saidi know you're going to be reallydisappointed when you get back to theu.sand you're not going to get nearly thesupport that you have all over the worldi gotta tell i was kind of nervous aboutthat boyand we could not have been more wrongi found americans to be among thefriendliest and most hospitableand most generous people of anywhere inthe worldanywhere in the world the friendliestthe most generousall the time people putting me uppicking up my check at the diner andjust you know stopping and giving megiftspeople giving you like here's some breadhere's a rockfrom the quarry and just running afterme giving me giftsand i saw that i was discovering americawith such completely different eyes andready to fightso then cut to 2016 of course and i wasthrilledi was on board with donald trump rightaway thinking you know he's abusinessmanif you are not looking with close eyesyou think he's some kind ofdoofus a big orange fella and he ain'tnodoofus i think predict this becausemark my words he is going to be a classin college in universities that peopleare going to studyhow is he 10 steps ahead of everybodyelseif you think he's stupid then you justkeep thinking thatbecause you know hehas fooled you soi am watching and studying what he doesflat out studying it because he is youyou can't be a successful real estatedeveloper in new york city andinternationally without being five stepsahead ten steps aheadso one of the biggest things i learnedon my walkfive years is that there isalways another side to the story everysingletime there is another side to the storyso as an example one time i was walkingup for two months i was walking up theeast coast of australia it's justnothing but farmland and they're hugefarms farmland farmlandfarmland and i don't remember thedetails except while i was walkingthrough this area there was a big strikegoing ontwo different sides of the strike and iwould stay with a family on one nightand they would tell meall about their side and i was like yeahyou're right i'm i'm with youhow could they and i'm all ranting raveni'm on your sidenext day i'm staying with another familythey're on the opposite side of thatstrike and they're telling me their sidei'm like yeahyou're right and i'm on your side andthen every night i would hear adifferent side to the storyand that was a game changer too there'salways a different side to the storyso now i know how to read the media asall of you do too otherwise you wouldn'tbe on thisuh great walkaway campaign so now when ihear somethingi don't believe it like automaticallydon't believe iteven if it's on our sidei dig into it what is the real story andthat's how ii listen and read and watch the newsat this point but umso i started out as a walk away but nowsince 2001i've been a walk away and now i'm a walkwithi'm a passionate walk with i will dowhat it takes to get donald trumpreelectedi think he is you think i'm crazy youthink this is an

well I hadn't planned on doing mywalkaway video yet but here I am 40years later at Fort Drum outside ofWatertown New York when my NAT vanhusband and I lived here in Great BendNew York which is also outside of FortDrum I was a liberal Democrat feministand now 40 years later I'm here waitingfor Air Force One to fly over so I canfly I can raise a sign that says godbless our president and I'm a total I'mtotally on the Trump train and my lifehas has dramatically changed in the past20 years I was born into a liberalfamily and I was a Democrat up until 20or so years ago after I got married andstarted having childrenbit by bit my my views started to changeand I didn't even realize itthen in 1996 I became a born-againChristian and I began to read the Bibleand a lot of things that I had privatelythought kind of fell into placeI had a renewed relationship with myhusband our marriage improved I had arenewed love for our three children notthat I didn't love them but I just sawthem as God's precious gifts many thingschanged for me and I realized after acouple of years that I was no longer aDemocrat I changed my politicalaffiliation to Republican fast forwardto the past oh I don't know maybe fivesix seven years and I began to realizethat I was probably more leaning towardslibertarian I didn't like what I sawfrom mainstream what I'll callmainstream Republicans rhinospublican and name only I thought youknow they're just they're just the sameold same old and then President or thenDonald Trump put in his candidacy and Ithought hmmI had thought in the back of my mindthat we didn't need anymore professionalpoliticians and he fit the bill and butI was in the closet so to speak of mysupport for him for a long time and thenfinally I was at a Republican Women'sCommittee luncheon and I outed myself asa trump supporter probably the only oneat the table and I thought well that'sit no no turning back now but even Iwasn't sure you know what his chanceswere I follow I follow social mediaFacebook in particular and I began totake note of the hundreds of thousandsof likes and shares that anytime he wason for the rallies that it just got bignumbers and I thought wow maybe I'mmaybe I'm not alone we traveled toout-of-state I live in New York Stateand central New York State I don't livein Manhattan or anything like thatand we traveled my husband and Itraveled out out to I think was Indianaon business and we were staying at ourhotel and there were people there whowere Trump supporters and they weren'tashamed of itand I was like wow this is kind ofrefreshing so anyway fast forward to thenight of the election and you know everyevery report I thought oh you know he'she's not going to be able to make it Iwoke up in the morning and he had oneeye I just I could not stop grinning fordays and a lot of our friends and familywho are conservative felt the same wayit was like there's a glimmer of hopeand I've only grown to have more andmore respect for him he's not perfectabsolutely not but that's okay he's heis one of the first politicians probablysince Reagan and Ididn't vote for Reagan that is actuallykeeping his promises his campaignpromises or trying very hard to and he'sgot so many against him that are inpowerful positions so I you know I prayfor him every day I'm part of thepresidential prayer team and I encourageeverybody else to pray for him pray forour country but anyway it was a longtime coming but that this is my walkawaymoment and I'm sorry that it's kind ofjittery I'm holding this this by handoutside of Fort Drum New York and godbless everyone thank you
my name is Kelly I'm from Arkansas I amNOT a Russian bot and I have alreadysubmitted a testimonial but Brandon madeit quite clear that it was imperativethat we start submitting videos so longstory short a child of the 80s teamactually born in the 70s I think mycat's gonna join in here anyway a lot ofdiversity in the 80s and DemocraticParty seemed like the option for me whenI was old enough to vote long storyshort the day after my 18th birthday Igave birth to my daughter who wasconceived due to rape it was a verydifficult time difficult situation butthe worst part was the fact that I had alot of family from up north that clashedwith the family here in the South and Iwas constantly being hammered to have anabortion told that I was a victim thatthe child would be born with this darkcloud over its head and she would thenbecome a victim and not a productivemember of society because of this darkcloud that would continually follow herand I decided that I needed to find away to break free of being a victim andseparate myself from that victimmentality and I did that I chose not tohave the abortion my daughter is a veryproductive member of society she's awonderful wonderful motherand all-around just great person thecircumstances have not affected who shehas become one bitbut that situation I believe is whattempted me to back up and researchabortion and why it seemed to be soheavily pushed by the Democrats it'shard for me to accept that a party thatchampioned themselves is loving andaccepting of all were also championsof murder because that's what it is so Icontinue to educate myself and decidedthat the Democratic Party was no placefor me not however not however soonenough because I did vote for BillClinton and I even defended him duringthe little blue dress incidentconvincing myself that it didn't matterbecause it was private yeah that's asticky situation anyway[Music]abortion is what prompted me to lookdeeper into the Republican Party and thedeeper I

name it it's all out therebut it's not defined by Republican orDemocratic it's defined by hate thesepeople just hate anything that'sdifferent I'm just not that way I'maccepting and to be a Democrat

welli think this will be my walk away storyum it's a little bit late i know to theparty because this apparentlystarted happening soon after trump'selection buti wasn't aware of it because i wasliving kind of my own life andsilence and everything like that as muchas the silent majorityso this is it my name is john minkerand uh i grew up democraticall my life i was surrounded by my dadas a single parent being a democrat andmy momshe was also a democrat is oneso i always when i came votingflew no matter who granted i only votedthree timesyeah three times uhfor democrats my first time first yearuh that i wanted to vote i couldn'tbecause my birthday fallsjust after uh the election cycleand that was george bush's first termuh i bo obama both timesuh the first time i actually i reallyagreedand really felt good about the policieshis agenda but unfortunately as timeprogressed i realized he wasn'tfulfilling the promises he was too muchconcerned about working with peopleto fulfill any of the things that hesaid he was going to doand then his policies started changing alot of what he promotedseemed off to me but i still agreedbecause i didn't do a lot of reading ijust watchedcnn or pbs or whatever the mainstreammediataught me i was here andso i continued to listen to that for along time but i startedto do a little bit of research i startedlooking at the history of the republicanand the democratic partyi started looking into other thingswhat the policies have been in the pastwhat people have been promotingand to me all i always saw about therepublican party it wasfor the longest time was big businessrich lined pockets andgod all the time but of course i learnedthatboth sides deal with religion i'm notreligious myselfbut to me as long as religion i don'tcare if they're religious as long asreligiondoesn't control and dictate policiesand they really don'ta lot of what theydid we have all the god and thingsin our american mantra but in the endit's still not our policiesregardless istarted when blms first happened iagreed with some of the things theyhave said i thought thatexcessive police brutality needed to endbut then i looked into it more irealized thata lot of what they're touting withpolice brutalitythe people were criminals there was someexcessive force but the fact of mattersare still criminalsnot all the time there's a lot of timesthat theywere innocents and they should beprosecuted andusually they are but the problem is iswhen you start looking at statisticswhen you start looking at thingspercentages and stuffthings don't line up it's an agenda thatyou just can't goit's not any different than everybodyelseand so when you look at a lot of thehard left you realizethere's so much hatred in vitriol theypromote peacethey promote the idea of equalitybut only if it fits their narrative theyshoot down blacks that opposetheir beliefs conservative blacksthey shoot down mexicans that agree withthe wallor anything like that the reason isbecausethey don't fit their agenda theirnarrativeor you have biden saying come on manyou're not black if you don't vote formeor it just makes senseand so as i did more research i realizedthis is nonsense i believe in theequalityof everybody regardless race breeds sexor any of that nonsenseit doesn't matter we're all people ibelieve thatthis the individual is responsible forthe individualnobody should silence somebodybecause we have freedom of speech inthis countryyou may not like something that somebodysays but it doesn't matteryou have the right to say it soi realized that the left walked awayfrom me the democratic party walked awayfrom me they became too extremein their ideology silence canceledcultureyou have outlets media wanting to frameeverything the reality to theirnarrative this isn't just thecnn and everything fox news does it tooi believeevery mainstream media regardless ofwhich side of thepolitical spectrum they're on they havea biasand so you don't just read one sourceyou don't take your information frommonsters you take it from multiplesourcescome to your own conclusion after doingyour researchso i am no longera democrat i will never consider myselfa republicanbut i was never a democrat fully in thefirst place i was never republican infirst placei was a moderate i was a liberalmoderateand i still consider myselfbut as it stands right now i see noreason to vote for the democratswhen they oppose the individualwhen they impose small businesseswhen they promote extreme ideologies andallow these riots togo on i live in seattlei'm planning on movingbut when chas and chop happened andpeople got shot there wasproblems there yes it wasn't all violentlikea lot of the right media like somethingbut it wasn't peacefulit was very harmful to people that wereliving in thereand were forced to deal with no servicesfrom the cityand the city did nothing police weretold to stand downso i could no longer agree with itand i encourage everybody to read newsfrom all sources right left moderatedoesn't matterfind out as much information about asituation as possibleevery angle and come to your ownconclusionnot every black person that's killedor beaten by a cop is innocent but noris every black that is beatenand killed by a cop also guilty thatgoes for whiteshispanic or anything for cops cops arepeoplethey're humans they make mistakespeople should be punished for mistakesthat causes harm to other peoplethat goes for both sides not just copsbut regular people as wellnobody should be punished for somethingthey didn't doand nobody should be considered guiltyuntil proven innocentshould be innocent until proven guiltyunfortunately our system is against thatphilosophy anymoreand i don't know why it shouldn't be

hi everyone my name is Tracy Goldsteinand I wanted to take a moment and postthe reason why I'm here I've beenfollowing this page since it came up andI've been reading your stories andbefore I began to tell you mine I wantto say that I'm very very very thankfulto read yours because they inspire meand because they remind me that there ishope in this world with that being saidif you didn't hear my last name I am aJewish woman living in America and it isreally really scary times I have walkedaway from the Democratic Party twice thefirst time was when I was in my 30s andI received my masters of Social Workfrom Washington University in st. LouisI entered that program is a bleedingliberal I was a straight Democraticvoter and I walked out of that programseeing the error of my ways I walkedaway from that program seeing theambiguity because while I am NOT on thereceiving end of oppression or thepolicies that create oppressionI saw the energy put in by the youth andthese programs that wanted to createpolicies that they actually thought werehelping people but in reality we'rekeeping them codependent on a systemthat would them I then wentabout my days as an independent and BillClinton came around and I liked him andso I started going back to my Democraticroots and then there was president ofpresident obama he did it with suchsmilehe didn't with such charisma i think heliterally could have served people aplate of feces and they would have beenhappy they would have eaten it and theywould have said thank you sirgive me more but being that i have apropensity for academia I looked at hisdomestic and foreign policyI felt that it created yet more Codependence on a system that cripplespeople and I also saw his foreign policyand the detriment that it caused to ourcountry and to our alliesI am socially a very loving warm andaccepting person I stand with mybrothers and sisters and being an allyof the lgbtqia+ movement I believe thatwhile I am personally pro-life I don'tbelieve that the government shouldlegislate a person's body but with theNew Democrats we have hate which I havebeen on the direct end of we have aculture of people who are againstbuilding walls but if you go to theirhouse they have walls all around them wehave candidates for president that aresocialists but they own seven homes andonly give three percent of theirearnings which is millions of dollars topeople in need the Democratic Party andits leadership have become hypocritesand they want to accomplish all thethingsI want with your money and my money butnot their own and so I'm walking awayagain I'm not sure where I'll end up Ireally don't know I just know it's nothere for me anymore so I hope youwelcome me as your Jewish sister in thisfight and I wish you all a great weekend[Music]
I'd like to talk about why I support thewalkaway movement and I guess I have tostart by claiming I'm not a Russian butin fact this goes to a reason that I dosupport the walk away the left wants toclaim that anyone who doesn't supportevery single policy they have is evilor isn't real we're Russian BOTS becausewe don't agree with everything they sayin fact they do that to each other ifthey don't agree 100% with each otherthey're kicked out of their groupthey're ostracized and think about whatthey do to people that actually opposethem we're called fascists and Nazis andracists and anything they can make up'men to be true it isn't truein fact we've seen lately that this ismuch more projection this is much moreabout things that they believe and thatthey do themselves it's not about usit's whatever that can be done to makeus look like were monsters and then itcomes it comes to the election andpeople that supported President Trumpdid so for a number of reasons and we'reseeing him answer these these concernsof the people now we were worried aboutterrorism we were worried about oureconomy we were worried about jobs he'sfixing these things they're bettersometimes than have ever been in historyand the people that oppose us and opposehim they just will not give any creditthey still want to say thatis about racism or sexism or somethingthat morally makes us monsters so let megive you the reason or the event thatreally brought this home for me I playvideo games with a group of people andit takes six to eight to for us to be onthe same team and we've played for fiveyears or more never had a disagreementwe played together two or three timesper week we were people from all overthe country and with men women people ofdifferent jobs different backgrounds andit was always about playing the game wehad conversations that would be more ofwhat friends do even though we havenever met each other until the 2016election then with so much vitriolcoming from the media and the campaign'spolitics somehow became part of ourvideo game playing and 2 out of the 8were not Democrats we felt verydifferently about what was being saidabout us about what the real issues ofthis campaign were and we weren't vocalabout it but when the topic would comeup we wouldn't just go along witheverything we would pose a questionmaybe there was a problem with Hillaryserver and her emails or maybe thisRussia thing maybe it's got a few holesin it just simple questions like thatthey were not tolerated the next thingwe hear is that the two people thatweren't liberals or leftist will callthem we were racists we were justevery moral problem that is wrong withthe country and all of a sudden that thecountry was a a fascist Nazi regimewhere Republicans and conservatives wedon't change our opinions that's onething you can criticize or complimentabout us we've been the same for yearsand years and so is the country DonaldTrump is the most consider the mostliberal Republican president we've everhad and yet these people that do want tochange everything about the countryclaim where the problem we're the onesthat changed we're the ones that are allof a sudden supporting Adolf Hitler andit's just ridiculous it's all it all hasto it all has to it all has to keepgoing with a continual lie and acontinual victimization of everybody whodoesn't agree the left has become a cultand it seems like the only people thatcan't see that are the people involvedwith the cult they act like iteverything that every issue that comesbefore them seems to be listen andbelieve if you ask a questionyou're not part of us if you're not partof us you have to be evil you have to bea misogynist you have to be a racist youhave to be homophobic and believe mewe're not any of that stuff we neverhave been so this is my walkaway momentI am a real person and not a Russian botI'm a very proud American and I justwant the whole country to do

what's going on Facebook what's going onboys and girls everywhere around theworld hey man she got tight IQ serverDave Turner man just wanted to just givemy take I know there's a new movementthe startings called the walk awaymovement and that walk away movement isactually encouraging individualsespecially those who have been left inthe dark and left and I left behind bythe Democrat Party to move away you knowit doesn't matter if you're gonna voteto the conservative movement just walkaway from issues that don't look thatdoes not help you when it comes to yourcommunity one thing about me peoplealways ask me do I turn why did youleave the Democrat Party and you knowthey axe it was really tough decisionyou know when I was part of the DemocratParty I was actually a high rankingmember of the state party I was electedand actually was in the position itselfyou know to make some changes andactually could have really moved aheadeven easier when it comes to mypolitical standing but the thing aboutit is I started seeing policies you knowpolicies within the party that was notreally affecting what skin we're nothelping my community I started seeingthe division within the Democrat Party Istarted to see how one group ofindividuals would actually separatethemself or him another group ofindividuals but yet the otherindividuals which made up 47% which wasAfrican Americanwe're actually the ones who are beingleft behind and so I tell individualsthis you know why I decided to walk awayI didn't walk away because I was madbecause I lost an election withoutpissed off because I didn't like youknow are certain people I just didn'tlike the movement I I'm a person who ama results-driven person I mean I tellpeople this you wouldn't hire someonethen they're not doing their job ifthey're not doing their job what wouldyou do you also be fired but the thingabout it I started to see the same thingwhen it came to me is that hey thesesame policies and that insane promisesthat have been told to my community forabout 50 55 yearsI even longer than that I had honestlyreally focused and actually moved awayfrom its overall mission you know theDemocrat Party straight more leftindividuals such as African American menit's the same policy I say historic youknow we have never been us an entitythat has been liked by the Democratseven if you want to go back to slaveryyou know black men have been were usedas since bucks says the individuals whowere the ones who the breeders you knowand were ripped away from their familiesmove to you know they were able did witha hit to impregnate the black woman andthe black woman the reason why she's sostronghonest his mother's and how she's happyto take an independent role becausehonestly this has been something thatDemocrats have done for so many yearsthey've actually you know we were movedaround to plantation to plantation justto be breeders to create brand-new laborbrand-new slave labor and the thingabout it is true they continued the samething and then when after reconstructionafter the Civil War you've seen blackmen who wanted to create families and wehad more families in our communities wehad our children were going to collegeHBCUs were created we started to see theinflux of black men who wanted to befamily a family oriented but the sametime to you also started to seeing ifyou break down the black family thenhonestly and you divide the black womanagainst the black man then ultimatelyyou know someone who's gonna step up tothat role and again ultimately the blackwoman has been the one that's chosenmore because she's emotionally shefocuses strictly on a lot of socialissues but black metal more fiscallyconservative they're more conservativein their issue then they allow them ormore religious a lot of thoseindividuals itself are family-orientedbut the thing about it is too we can'tstep short end of the stick even whenyou look at child support you know theblack man knows the most likely is gonnabe the one who catches the short in thestick if you start to look at our lawenforcement you start to look at how thecriminal justice system the threestrikes laws which were created byDemocrats where individuals thatactually destroy our community eveninput and it forced us a little bitfurther away so the thing I start to payattention to is when they broke downthat system the Democrat parted so theblack woman has been the one that's beenthe upstanding and the one who honestlyhas been the one who's kept the DemocratParty afloathonestly when it comes to me and I speakto my community I'm sorry to separatemyself but ultimately the black womanwas probably will probably be the lastgroup of individuals to really leave theDemocrat Party because she's honestlybeen the beneficiary of Democrat Party Iwas give me policy excuse me and this isthe thing I tell people back in 1932 andwhen you know FDR camethey started to create the New Dealprograms and Welfare and Weller's youknow government assistance became billreally big there was two levels of thattwo levels of welfare at that timewelfare back in the day if you were asingle white man who had a wife at homeand you worked would probably be thewould be the recipients of the firstlevel of welfare and that second levelof welfare actually was basically givento a single black woman and so honestlyif you look at the welfare you signedthose paperwork's and you obviouslyrealize a black man cannot be presentand the home you they cannot be presentat the home for that black woman toreceive welfare if you start to thinksee things like WIC and other programslike that it benefits the black woman sohonestly the black woman will be thelast group of individuals that wouldleave the Democrat plantation or all theliberal plantation or would then itcomes to liberal issues when I start tosee a lot of black men today you knowlook at Democrat partisan policies todayyou know now they're pushing that wouldrather have black men locked up then andthey will let they would rather let inms-13 that tells you a lot you know andwe talk about illegal immigration thataffects black men 100% 1000% honestly itaffects the black community 1,000% thoseare gonna be the individuals who youwill see it social services who live inthose low-income housing at the sametime to the bay there'll be theindividuals who would actually workthose those service jobs and honestlythe contracting as well as theconstruction jobs for lower wages andblack men who used to do it cannot findthose jobs and so ultimately when I seeblack men today and I just tells me alittle bit about New York when I was inNew York there was a place againthey had day laborers and individualswould go to try to find jobs in theconstruction agency but there was soheavily populated and flooded by illegalimmigrants who would get paid penniesunderneath the table because ultimatelyagain they stuck together with their owngroups and black men who one of thosejobs who might have been recipients ofyou might have had a felony or had youknow a criminal past who actually wastrying to make better for them livetheir lives would try to come back outof there out of prison and make a betterlife for their child but at that timethe black woman has been empowered bythe US governmentso also me the US government has beenthe fathers to so many black childrensince the 1960's even 1932 when theystarted the first beginning the welfareprogram and some people don't realizethat black folks have been have beenvoting majority Democrat not since 1964it's been since 1932 and that's sobecause before we were majorityRepublican but then of course the GreatDepression happened and all simply FDRcame about and starts to create New Dealprograms but we were split but the thingabout the community is we continue tohave a split and we continue to have avoice before we became direct depositDemocrats and when I start to see rightnow when it comes to black men black menare being overshadowed I've seen some ofthe great leaders that you have here whomay not be liberal who are straight-upKahoot might be moderate who understandwho still have a Christian backgroundwho love God who at the same time stillhave their own views even here in mycity you know I've seen certainlawmakers who were replaced because theydid not conform to the Liberal DemocratPark policy but yet they were the mosteffective lawmakers that Democrats everhad because they were able to create abipartisan type of relationship with theother party and the Democrats theLiberals did not like that they calledthose people traitors and they made surethat they got those people out of officeand replaced him with black womenMuslims individuals who you know and nodisrespect I have no problem with theMuslim community but the thing about itis to these individuals were the bestlawmakers that they had in this citythey were the most effective lawmakersin the city but yet they got rid ofthose individuals because again they didnot conform to the new liberal socialistparty which is known as the DemocratParty again the white liberal they stilllove God and when they made their andwhen they voted they voted with theirconvictions and the thing about it istoo for black men black men thingsdifferent many people from my party Itold even people in the community thatthe black men would be the first oneswho would honestly really considerleaving the dent with the Democrat Partybecome independent or even becomeconservatives because ultimately we aremore focused on fiscal issues what's inour wallets if we're able to feed ourfamilies but the problem that you startto have is an issue where again if youwant to get rid of a black lawmaker orblack Democrat all you have to do is runa black woman against them againthe number one fans of the DemocratParty have been the black woman andagain I love my black women butultimately they have been in powerthey've been in power about the USgovernment they've been the ones whoheld this dick they've been the onesthat ultimately when the black man whomight have been incarcerated tries tocome back and they wonder why there's abig issue when it comes to recidivism wesaid it as an issue when it comes toindividuals going back into jail theymight have been the ones who may not whohave made a mistakewho might have sold drugs to buy five oftheir family or had an issue when theywere younger but when they came backthey had a felony and now they cannotget a job but then they try to come backand they say hey I want to come backhome that what black woman has alreadysigned off everything to the USgovernment and now the US government isthe new man in the house so therefore ablack man cannot come into the householdso ultimately I'm just telling you thisfor me again I'm a person who looks atfacts and I look at 50 I look I lookingfor what it is you know if you do nothold your lawmakers in your communitiesaccountable those people who excuse mewhoo-hoo honestly represent thosedistricts you're gonna continue to seewhat you see today and ultimately whenit comes to black men it's also going tobe you just like those former slaves didthey came back and they were able tocreate the family without the familystructure we're not gonna be anything inthe black community I'm a member growingup you at least had programming such asgood times they don't matter if you wasthat they let that down that y'allyou're down on your dollar and had nomoney if you were in the ghettos in thehood good times you had a man and awoman in the household you have TheCosby Show which shows middle classblack men black people middle and upperclassic success you had a programmingfamily matters it had a man and a wifein the household you had programs againthat honestly reflected a positivehousehold where they came to the blackcommunity but the problem is now thethings that we look at and how thoughthe Liberals have already turned us isnow love and hip-hop and being a babyit's very very one is more importantthan creating a family and the blackwomen have gotten to a point now thathey I don't need a man I don't need aman for nothingbut ultimately it's sure because the USgovernment is ultimately replace you andagain with you looking right now thislook at the last democratic you knowchairman election there was a black manwho ran okaysacré Ellison although I'm not a fan ofEllisonhis entire black caucus who had he hadbeen a member for four years votedagainst him becoming the chair of theDemocrat Party but the Democrats saidhey we already give you a black chairwe're giving you two you know you knowwe already had one of those we don'tneed those anymore and then they lookedat the numbers at the last election whenabout eighty eight percent less than the95 percent that voted for Barack Obamayou know started to voted for a and eventhirteen percent of black men voted fora trump you know you started to see heywe don't need you anymoreso they put Perez in they put inHispanic in the first Hispanic chairmanof the Democratic Party and it's for areason it's for design it's not becauseultimately he was the most qualifiedbecause honestly he's an imbecile forwhat I see but the thing about it isthey did it because ultimately they wantto pull out a new group of people toreplace you and that's gonna be theillegals and Hispanics if the Democratsput as much time in our communities thetop ten with the highest crime rates inAmerica which are run by Democrats everyslum in America come on listen to thisevery slum and guilt in America is runby Democrat so how does that help youout they say they're fighting for youwell honestly you must not be fightingso hard and if you can't fight hardenough for us and change the trajectoryof this community then we need to getsomebody else in place but the problemis you have people like Maxine Watersand people like cleaver and people arelike who else Jesse Jackson al Sharptonall these people who call themselvesJews who are ultra bleep black pawns andeven when it came to their last electionwhen you hadHilary Clinton going through issues whenDonald Trump made the the the the thestatement what difference do you does itmake Hillary Clinton called and marchedout the whole and I our black caucus tomake a statement against Donald Trumpand ultimately if you look at it rightnow the leadership that you have rightnow and so in it because they get theirmarching orders from those above soultimately black men I'm making theappeal to you and you start to see thisas I'm so happy to see so many black menwho are stepping up to the plate and arebeing free thinkers who are not afraidto say hey this is not working for mycommunity this party has lied to us forso many years they've act like they'reyour friends but liberal policyultimately is doing nothing to upliftthe black community we're not followingHollywood when you start to look at thepolicies of the President opening upfactories it's not just white peoplethat work in those factories it'sindividuals at black people work inthose factoriesblack men have been the main group ofindividuals who tried to make a try toget back and they living for theirfamilies but the problem is is once youhave a felony on your record it's hardfor you to really get a good-paying joband then you try to get into the serviceindustry but yet you've been replaced bythe same illegals that the Democrats arepushing today open borders again I tellyou this is all about a plan a biggerplan this plan has been enacted foryears they are wanting to create a brandnew voting bloc a new group of directdeposit Democrats because they start torealize that not only a populationdecreasing but ultimately we're startingto wake up and not giving them that boatthat they want 24/7 have you everwondered why they don't ever come intoyour communities only only come aroundduring the presidential elections theydon't really educate you on what theseoffices do and they really don't comearound when it comes to those localelections this is the thing there is aagenda out there when they look at thepublic schools public schools arefailing I'm here in CharlotteMecklenburg when you have about 60% ofthe school board that has black facesbut yet you still have segregatedlow-performing schools what it what whyare you there because ultimately theyget their marching orders from someonehigher these are the ones that wouldexactly what's put in place for them tomove ahead and stay in their positionultimately it's not a class strugglewithin our communities you know see meit's not a black and white it's a classstruggle in our communities is those whoare up at the top who might like metrying to keep those like me at thebottom again that's the reason why Iwalked away and I'm gonna tell you thisright now honest another reason why Iwalked away is because once the DemocratParty elected a person who has whitesupremacist background I'm gonna keeptelling you this over and over againthey talk about this so-called switchthere was never a switch ultimately onething I've noticed about you knowindividuals in this community isdifferent about this before they vote aparty and ultimately ultimately i'matell you this right now those sameDemocrats you got to realize slavemasters interact with slaves they knewhow to control those slaves they had noproblem being around the slaves soultimately when it comes to today it'sthe same thing you haven't been free youare still underneath their party youvote the same way robert e lee d roberte lee when he walked walked in thevoting booth he walked and calledhimself a proud Democrat and you want torename a school because his name afterrobert e lee or you want to take out ourstatue because it's named after robert elee but yet when you go to the votingbooth you vote the same way roberte-media huh again it goes back to theignorance of our community if yourealize two of our schools they don'ttalk about civics they don't talk abouteven when it comes to your true historythat past slavery you do have a historyand i'm when it looks to education andwe also look at the lack of upwardmobility in some of these communitieseven here in my city charlotte it'sbetter off you coming from somewhereelse than may you for be from a personwho's from here to even move up becauseultimately they got you in a trapand I'll tell you this black manthey've been the main one locking you upthey've been the main one pushing thesepolicies and I tell them this if thatwas so and even when it comes to ourformer president if he was so worriedabout the black community when you hadboth houses of Congress why didn't youget rid of three stripes the thing aboutit is two is ultimately theseindividuals make money people likeHillary Clinton opened up more prisonsthan you in NY state than any othersenator the prison-industrial prisonchronic complex has been run if yourealize when it comes to public schoolsthey build prisons at their with inthird grade off of test scores and theymove kids around even with the lastadministration the education systemdropped four points and people don'trealize that black people it's not foryou honestly I want you to wake up and Iacts you ask yourself this question whyare you a Democrat is it because theysay you're black but also why are you aDemocrat ask yourself that question whathave they done for you lately and whenit comes to that point you after youreally ought to sit back and look aroundyou'll realize honestly you're not evena thought because ultimately they have abigger plan the liberal agenda againlike Malcolm X said and I'm sorry tomake it so hard he said but blackmanaged vote Democrat that you aredisgrace to your race because ultimatelythe white liberal cares nothing aboutyou again it's the slave masters theyknow how to control you they've beenaround you they are the ones whohonestly you know push the Willie Lynchyou know model to you they're the onewho used you to talk out against anotherone and others another slave who wassmart and intelligentwe brought an idea he always used theother ones to go against him becauseultimately that was his lifeline thatwas safety that was their safety net andthey didn't want anything to disruptthat why are you what is your liver whatwhy do you have a loyalty to a partywhich ultimatelyhas nothing done nothing coming in justlook around look at our schools we don'tfocus on education no more look at ourfamilies there's no any women in thehouseholds anymore let's really payattention to our prison in New York Citythere are more black men in prison thanthere are black men with college degreesif you realize again wake up and whenyou wake up be like me it's okay nomatter what they say it's okay to walkaway y'all be blessed Lee everybodythank you for joining this broadcast agod bless americawake up now it's time it really is timematter of fact it's been - y'all beblessed peace
hello i'm tinai'm 49 years old i've been a democratsince i was18. did not vote forobama or hillary did not like either oneof themand the reason why i walked away wasseeing how the democratic party has beenback in the blm as i call burn lootmurder um i don't agree with thatmy mom always taught me raisin you knowthat if you broke somethingof somebody else's you replaced it ifyou broke your own thing if you wanted anew one you paid for it yourselfi see uh pelosiwant money from the governmentto fix these democratic towns that havebeen burning up in it becausethey've allowed it to happen but umyeah yeah when i wasa democrat nobody ever called me racistor anything to that extenti have a family with multiple differentraces in themi'm firefront races but since i left thedemocratic partythat's all i'm called anymore and itjust shows methat it's not the republicans whoare racist like they're callingpresident trumpbut the fact that is it's the democratswho'sactually the racist ones and if youdon't agree with themthen you're racist so yeahnobody turned me away from thedemocratic party but the democraticpartyyes as my dog wants some attention soall right you guys have a good onestop nico stop
okay so I've never had to walk awaybecause I've never been a Democrat but Isaw this movement and I really wanted toadd my input um you know growing up Inever I never was associated with eitherparty my parents you know my parentswere never you know Democrat they werenever Republican they always were kindof just like in the middle theirindependence and that's how I was raisedjust to be an independent thinker andyou know my beliefs don't perfectlyaligned with Republicans nor did theyever perfectly aligned with Democrats soI've always kind of been more centeredbut up in the past couple yearsespecially I find that I've reallyreally even though I'm still centeredand I'm slightly conservative I amcompletely anti left and that doesn'tmean I disagree with or I hate everybodythat is on the left but I hate what theleft has become and what it stands forfor example the first time that I reallyreally started getting red flags goingup was probably in between the time ofObama's second term and whenever Trumpwas against Hillary and in between thattime I you know I started getting redflags like wow you know the left isreally really pushing it because youknow I'm okay everybody has differentopinions everybody's allowed to thinkdifferently and that's okay that's youknow that's the beauty of America we allhave different opinions where theproblem starts is whenever you startbelieving that your way is the onlyright way and anybody that disagreeswith you is a Nazi is you knowanti-woman is anti LGBT is you knowhateful is racist that's where you knowyou I draw the line you know and and thebig big moment for me that I really eventhough like I said I've been anindependent forever the big moment forme that I really was like I will neverever want to associate myself with theleft is Donald Trump being elected and Ithink it was because you know the wholetime that he was up againHilary as you all know the media waspainting a different picture than whatwas actually happening all of thesepolls that they were showing that wasgoing on during pre-election was showingthere's no chance Donald Trump could winHillary's gonna be the next presidentand it just was like always in your facealways in your faceHillary's gonna win liberals Democratseverything was anti Donald Trump andthen he won and all of my friends on myFacebook and even some of my familymembers instantly became hateful purehateful I had people wish that theywould see America fail just so theydidn't have to see Donald Trump succeedwhich is like the most unamerican thingthat you could possibly do but I meanI've had family cut me off people thatyou know they they completely anybodythat I'm associated with that is on theleft are some of the most judgmentalpeople I have ever met in my life andthey want to tell you that you'rehateful that you're all of theseterrible things and I think that'sthat's why Brandon's video really stuckwith me is because I related even thoughI'm not you know I'm not a minority asfar as you know I'm obviously a whitefemale I mean that even though Democratswouldn't tell me because I'm a femaleI'm automatically set back in lifebecause I'm not a man I'm not you knowI'm not a minority but I've experiencedfirsthand you know people you know tellme oh you have to be heartless you haveto be this you have to be that because Ididn't agree with democratic ideologiesand I'm not I'm not at all but likethat's that's where it really hit homefor me is you know my problem is youknow the DemocratsI appreciate that everybody's entitledto their own thoughts to their ownopinions but the moment you starttelling people that they are bad peoplethat there's something intrinsicallywrong with them as human beings becausetheir their views don't align with yourparty views then your party shouldn'texist it's wrong it's wrong if that'ssocialism in the making and you know Iwant nothing to do with that so you knowI a hundred percent walk Isupport walk away and you know I reallyreally hope to see other people speakingout because my facebook it's likeeverybody is so brave to be liberaleverybody is so brave to bash DonaldTrump everybody is so brave to blameevery white person in this world foreverything and it's just it's not rightanymore and I'm sick of havingconservative friends who are afraid tospeak up and afraid to say you guys thisis wrong you're not you're not rightabout everythingum I have friends that are afraid tospeak up because of the hate that theyget because liberals are so bold youknow to criticize everybody else so youknow speak up don't be afraid to walkaway don't be afraid to stand up forwhat you believe in and more thananything walking away I think it needsto be pointed out that just because youwalk away from the left does not meanthat you have to become a Republican itdoesn't mean that you have to even befully conservative it just means thatyou're fed up with the crap from theleft you're fed up with you know themsaying that they're right they're theonly right answer they know everythingyou know it's it's the party of Liesit's the party of deception and nobodyshould want a part of it nobody shouldwant to be part of the party thatvictimizes you all of the time thattells you no matter what you won'tsucceed and wants to blame every everywhite person in the world for every racerelation issue because it's just nottrue the facts are not true and morethan once I've presented facts to peoplein an argument any kind of liberalargument any kind of democratic argumentand they can't argue facts so you knowjust to walk away from the left does notmean that you have to go right you canstay sinner be an independent thinkerand honestly that I believe is thefuture of the country I don't think thatthe future is Republicans and DemocratsI think the future is gonna be goodbyetwo-party system everybody is gonna havea brain of their own and they're gonnathink with the brain of their own and asa millennial I have hope for mygeneration that we're gonna do away withthe two-party system because it's timethatgoes but hands down walk away from theleft they're toxic they run onnegativity they run on you know the factthat they believe that they want or theywant you to believe that you cannotsucceed as a woman as a gay man as a gaywoman as a trans you cannot succeed youcan as a black person as an immigrantanybody that's not white pretty muchthat you cannot succeed in this countryor in this life without them to speakfor you and I believe that every personin this world I don't care who you are Idon't care your genderI don't care your sexual orientation Idon't care any of that I believe that ifyou want something in life if you fightfor it you will get it and you don'thave to do it in a negative way so joinme walk away from the left you don'teven have to walk right just stay Centerlet's do ityouokay so I've never had to walk awaybecause I've never been a Democrat but Isaw this

hi my name is Donna and this is my walkaway video and I think I'm really moreof a walk with but I'll tell you when Iwalked away first I want to say Brandonyou're amazing and I pray for you and Ithank God for you and I so admire yourcourage and the the the fight thatyou're in is so vital to the survival ofthis nation so I just come into and Iwant to come into everybody who's hadthe courage to make a walk away videoand the other day I was watching themagain cuz whenever I start to get downand I stumble upon the nonsense theabsolute disinformation and propagandathat I see on Facebook and I start toget discouraged and lose hope I'll haveto go and watch them walk away videosI'm like okay not everybody has losttheir mind there are there is still somepeople paying attention and so youreally encourage me and motivate me andkeep me going and it finally occurred tome you know Donna the only reason youhaven't made a walkaway video is becauseyou're a coward and you've got 5,000Facebook friends and you don't want tolose them because I kind of make myliving online and I thought point that'sreally shallow so I'm gonna do my walkaway video my story is that I was raisedin an Irish Catholic Democratic familyand that's like all one-word IrishCatholic Democrat we my dad was a truckdriver my dad my my brothers my unclesall of my male relatives they were allunion workers a lot of them werecarpenters truck drivers so if you wereUnion a you were Democrat if you wereUnionyou were Democrat I remember in ourhallway growing up we had a crucifix andthen on either side we had Jesus andJohn F Kennedy and both of them werebedecked with palm fronds from PalmFridayI mean Palm Sunday because in in ourworld they were pretty much on par youknow you had Jesus and you have Jonathanso we were the original identitypolitics people we were so excited thatsomeone like us an Irish Catholic madeit to the presidency so I understood whythe african-american community was soexcited about Obama does it Wow someonein the White House who is like us and Itook we I totally get itwe were identity politics before therewas a term for it and so that was kindof my world and I'm I'm almost 60 so Iremember Jimmy CarterI remember the malaise I remember thehopelessness it was like the air webreathed was despair and if you everwant to get a sense of it there's afantastic movie it's called invinciblewith mark world wall birth and it's atrue story about a bartender in SouthPhilly who tries out for thePhiladelphia Eagles and spoiler alertyeah he makes the team they wouldn'thave made a movie if he didn't butanyway it's set in that time period whenCarter was in power and you just sensethe abject despair in the country andthat's what I grew up with with aDemocrat in power the other movie thatyou can watch to really get a sense ofwhat it was is is miracle about the 1980hockey team because you know it's setthan all the training in the backgroundis the 1970s but anyway be that as itmay just complete hopelessness but wewere all Democrats and then RonaldReagan came along and I can rememberwatching his speech at the RepublicanNational Convention and I was spellboundabsolutely spellbound and I think atthat moment I walked away and I watchedone man restore nation thetransformation in the mindset and thatthat's really what it is it's a mindsetwas just phenomenal and now of courseI'm a mother and I have two children andI've lived through at least sixten years of completely failedpresidencies I mean W it was a completeand abject failure as a president allthe wars and and madness and nonsenseand then eight years of Obama completelyfailed presidency so sixteen years andmy my kids are twenty eight twenty twoand I thought you know they're nevergoing to see a successful president sayand then Trump came along and just Ithink he's gonna tear it up but theopposition against him is just so soincredible but anyway what I wanted tosay is when I made the decision tobecome a Republican and I walked awayback in 1980 there was so much flak inmy family I mean I just could notbelieve that I was doing this but thefunniest thing is now I'll go to like onFacebook I'll go to like Breitbart orFox News or the president's page andI'll see my family members thumbs-upthing yeah they've all walked away theyI'm not all that I don't know if all ofthem but a lot of them have and I'mamazed like Union guys truck driversthey're walking away too so that's kindof my walk away story I just want to sayone more thing on on a personal notewhat really really infuriates me is howlightly people throw away the termracism as a way to shut someone up and Ijust want to give a really a personalstory and then what I know from thefrontline my daughter who's now 22 isthe most like solid stable onion moatshe's not emotional she plays thingskind of close to the vest just a realsteady steady young lady I mean she wasworking at a gym in the nursery you knowpeople are working out she's watchingtheir kids and I get a call from her andshe was absolutely hysterical I havenever heard her that hysterical in myentire life and she just said momsomething happen at work please pray formeI thought she'd been raped that's howhysterical she was and I she came homeand I'm like I myself I'm like whathappenedsaid mom there was a couple and theyaccused me of being a racist they wentto my boss and they said that I I didn'tpay enough attention to their you knowto their african-american child that Iwas paying to the other children justlike I love all the children equally Iliterally had been holding him half thetime and it just set him down and theysaid that I was a racist she saidthere's a worst thing anyone has eversaid in my entire life and to this dayshe will tell you the worst thing thatanyone has ever done to her was accusingher of being a racist and I think mostpeople feel that way like she's like howhow can I take my heart out and showthem that it's not in thereshe's crushed and and the duck has Olearmanner that people throw around thatword just to shot each other up isdespicable to me I can't even put it ininto words and again I'm old enough sheI have seen some some really bad timesin this countryand I think anyone with a with a pulseand a drop of integrity and conscienceknows that this country's had a bigproblem with it there really was ahistory of great evil in slavery and tobe thrown in with with that level ofevil so cavalierlyI just Wow it's incredible and I find itinfuriating and I that's why I'm reallyexcited to see the diversity in thismovement I think it's really importantand then the last thing that I want tosay and is that I work with Hispanic I'mnot Hispanic I'm as I told you I'm Irishbut I work for Hispanic InternationalMinistries and it's based in BogotaColombia so most of my work is inColombia but I work all over for 15years I've worked all over CentralAmerica and Latin America CentralAmerica and South America and I was justin Guatemala and I literally followedthe path from the border of Hondurasstraight through Guatemalato Mexico and that was with I work withnonprofits and I work with churches andpastors and we followed the exact pathand I was with a pastor and I said sotell me about this I mean I know what itis since who tell me firsthand firsthandyou were right in the path of this whatwas this Caravan all about he said Donnathese are the most vile violent viciousevil people you can imagine they left atrail of wreckage in their wakerobberies rapes massive destruction hesaid what they do is they get the womenand the children then they use them asprops and I was working specificallywith an NGO that does a lot of rescuework child rescue work it's anincredible organization in fact I'mgoing back to Guatemala with them in acouple months if you want to come withme let me know and I was talking to oneof the rescuers and I said so howserious is is the sex trafficking ofyoung women he said non-existent I'mlike what you said yeah no young womenhere are perfectly safe all of thetrafficking now is children so when theysay hey all you need to get across theborder free to these evil eviltraffickers all you need is a child intow do you know what they do they createa market for children and so now all thechildren are being not all the childrenbut thousands and thousands and tens ofthousands of children in Central Americaespecially but Latin America around theworld they're being kidnapped they'rebeing bought they're being sold they'rebeing sexually exploited because they'rea free ticket you want to know why 600children have not been picked up bytheir parents at the detention centersbecause they were parted from theirparents so long before that journeybegan and you know to have some I havepeople on Facebook this one guy justlast week called me we ready racist Imean I go I'm like I went that do youspeakbanished because I'm pretty fluent and Ispent a lot of my time last year threemonths in Costa Rica a month in Braziltwo weeks in Guatemala I spent a lot oftime in Latin America and so I can tellyou firsthand firsthand that people whospeak Spanish are more than capable ofcoming to a proper point of entry andpresenting the documentation and it'sactually racist to imply that they can'tbecause they absolutely again the peoplesneaking through beware because they'revery very dangerous and so I think againto see this movement to see blacks it tosee now I guess it's LexA the the Latinoaccent it just really gives me hope andI wanted to go ahead and put my face outthere and say I believe in what you'redoing Brandon I I want to come into allof you and this ended up being longerthan I thought it would but I'm so happyto see many other people walking away Iwalked away decades ago and I've

hello my name is Dan Chavez I am aresident of the city of Oxnard inCalifornia Southern California to beexactlocated in Ventura County one of thethings that I wanted to take thisopportunity and pretty much share mystory of the walk away back in 2016 Iwalked away growing up I was alwayspretty much taught that the DemocratParty is for the minorities and the poorwell I am one the oldest of four boysand came from a single-parent householdmy mother working two three minimum-wagejobs and my brothers and I we still sawher struggling I remember seeing herface so many times when she would walkout from you know government assistancebuildings to try to get support to helpyou know buy food or whatever and themtelling her all the timeyou made too much yet if she tried to goget a car or a house she didn't makeenough again it was always taught to methat you had to be rich and white to beRepublican and minorities and those thatwere poor or Democrats and I believethat so much because in school it wasimplanted into so much so when I turned18 I registered as a Democrat I followedthe Democrat rules to always vote for aDemocrat and even if the person wasn'tthe best choice that's who I still votedfor it wasn't until 2016 in my communitywhen I ran for City Council that I metcandidates that were running fordifferent offices throughout the stateof California and there was a couple ofthem that I met that were Republican andI was really impressed by how theywanted to make a change in the communitywas the exact same change that I wantedto make when I ran for City Council Iran on a very simple promise to theresidents protect our families ourcommunity and our futuresimple as that so in 2016 I met theseamazing candidates started to learn moreabout the Republican Party and where itall started and and what it stood forand in December of 2016 I registered asa Republican not because of who thepresident was was because a simplesimply that what the Republican Partyrepresented was something that Ibelieved in I believed in public safetyI believe in working hard to get thingsin life I believe and not depending onanybody what the Democrat Party does isthe opposite of that I couldn't supporta party any longer that wanted to enablepeople or allow criminals to run wild inthe state of California it's sad thatthere are so many laws that gives morerights more protections to criminalsthan to law-abiding residents every daya few years ago we had a be 109 pass byGovernor Brown that released hundredsand thousands of inmates then Prop 47came early release proud 57 changed theway our justice system waswho got tried as an adult who got triedas a minorand so forth and then recently the stateassembly just passed SB 10 which is whatthey consider bail reform but itactually

sure somebodywould tell me if I did it wrong I walkedaway and you can't do
okay I had to make a video about thisbecause everybody is still upset aboutthe election and people keep asking mewho did I vote for well I'm a Republicanand I don't tow the party line oneverything but I tell you point blankand playing I am not afraid to admit orshare with the world that I was proud tovote for Donald J Trump and I'm gonnatell you why man because I am so sickand tired of the same old politicianspromising the same thing every four toeight years this same cycle and guesswhat nothing nothing changes nothingthey get comfortable with the power toget comfortable with a position and theyget a nice effect on the success of notdoing a damn thing now before y'all getbutthurt about this I was also veryadamant and proud of voting for BarackObama in 2008 and 2012 and that is not aslight against John McCain you know hehe served our country and he was a PLWand to me he is still an American Herookay but you can't fight history andObama is gonna be President period thecountry moved to the left okay they gotupset with Bush and I don't agree witheverything Bush did and also I mean Idisagree with a lot of things thatPresident Bush did and the country spokeand this is a democracy ladies andgentlemen and when President Obama blewJohn McCain out there was no riots therewas no property being destroyed yes itwas some words being tossed back andforth on both sides and to me that shameon both sides but that's how democracyworks somebody's gonna win andsomebody's gonna lose but to the victorgoes the spoils and you are responsiblefor the direction of this country forthe next four years that's the cycle andthen if you don't do a good job you getbooted out of here that's how democracyworks and it's 2012 when Mitt Romney ranagainst Barack Obama Barack Obama wonthe country went left in its state leftand it did not like Mitt Romney'spolicies or how he presented himselfeverybody had their own reason or why hedid not like Mitt Romney and Mitt Romneyis not an evil person he's not he justplayed in the game of politics and helost it is what it isnow fast-forward to one of the singlemost unique elections in history you gota man who had absolutely no politicalexperience against the woman who has had30 years of political experience nowsometimes experience can be a very verygood thing because it shows wisdom andbeing trialed through fire you gothrough things and you build thatleadership that character comes andyou're able to help people and you'reable to move the country forward fromyour experience also experience can be avery bad thing because if you've beendoing something long enough and notenough people have seen any kind ofpositive movement or any kind ofpositive improvement even though you'vebeen getting millions and millions ofdollars something's wrong now this isn'tsets ISM this isn't racism because bothcandidates were white both you knowwhite well he's orange but you got awhite man and you got a white woman oneis 69 years old one is 70 years old soraysysm was not an issue no other racistcomments from supporters on both sidesbeing tossed around like bad wordtenantsyeah it's shameful and all of you shouldbe ashamed of yourselves and it's wrongwhether you're on the left or on therightbigotry prejudice racism sexism feminismall the isms is wrong period and you donot represent me and you do notrepresent the majority of the country ofpeople that honestly just want thecountry to go in a different directionand feel that maybe Hillary just was notthe answer now there will be a womanpresident I honestly believe there willbe a woman president within the nextsixteen to twenty years it goes byreally really quickly there will be butthat first woman president is gonna havethe respect of the majority of thecountry and that is how democracy worksand people want to get rid of theelectoral college well you know some ofthe electoral college was invented tokeep mob ruled from ruling the countrynow if you don't understand that go andtake your civics classes in college oryou got some in high school on theimportance of the electoral college andfirm balanced representation of theentire country you'll be fascinated bywhat you learn in those classes andabout how the country really works andabout how the democratic process ofvoting in a president works so foreverybody that's upset because you can'tget lost well guess what before the endof your lifetime nine times out of tenmore and more of your candidates aregoing to lose and more and more of yourcandidates before your lifetime aregoing to win now you win with grace youyou don't have to hold the losers handsbecause the victor to the victor go thespoilsbut two people that lose the best thingyou could possibly doinstead of burn and stuff down insteadof destroying your communities or thecommunities of others as your bust inbuild not only build but build a massivecoalition and convince people throughevidence and facts of why your point ofview is superior then your opponent'spoint of view and why your direction ofthe country is better than the otherthat's how democracy works to say thatDonald Trump is going to destroy Americawhile you're destroying America is anoxymoron it's hypocritical I know you'reangry I know you're hurt but if I wasmad at you and you pissed me offand I said you know something I want tobreak the law and I want to come to yourhouse and I want to tear up your stuffbecause I'm mad at what you said youwould say why G night storm you need toget control of your emotions brother andthis is irresponsible behavior and howin the world you you think you canconvince me of the words that you arespeaking because your actions arescreaming louder than any words thatever come out of your mouth you aredestroying my country you're destroyingmy home you're destroying my job or howI'm able to take care of people and myfamily and my children if you want toconvince me didn't convince me show methrough your policies through youractions then listen to your words so onthat note I want to say God bless thiscountry and I wish Donald Trump the verybest for the job that he has becauseit's never done this before he'sneed a lot of help but it is our duty asAmericans to pull behind a presidentregardless if it's a Democrat or if it'sa Republican respect the office and Iknow so many so many liberals say wellObama was not respected in thepresidential office and he wasn't it isthe truth and it is shameful and I willsay this one more timebigots on both sides whether you have aare in front of your name or D in frontof your name if you cannot respect theoffice of the president then you have nobusiness voting for president and youhave no business running for presidentso period you can agree to disagreeagree to disagree but by the end of theday when Donald Trump is in that WhiteHouse and President Obama was sittingnext to him both men put aside all theBS and the rhetoric of the campaign andput the country first both men hadnothing but respect for each other anddynatrap had respect for President Obamaand President Obama had respect forpresident elect Donald Trump becausethat's democracy that that's how you getthe job done that is what America isaboutwe will fight but we will respect eachother move forward and get on with thebusiness of governing our great countryso god bless you god bless Republicansgod bless Democratsgod bless liberals god blessconservatives god bless independence andgod bless everybody that hears my voiceI love you you're my brothers and you'remy sisters let's make this country greatbecause the president regardless of whoit is does not make the country great itis meand it is you that makes this countrygreatso halogen later and I look forward toreading the comments on this video godbless you all bye

hi just gonna give you a little bit ofan update my name is Debbie and I am 53years old and this is my walk away videofor most of my life I was a registeredindependent but I voted Democrat formany years I voted for Bill Clintontwice I voted for Obama twice and I hada brother who kept telling me why do youkeep voting the way you are and my thingwas because I'm a lesbian and theDemocrats are looking out for me not theRepublicans well second term with Obamaand I start to see things that didn'tmake a lot of sense I saw that thingsare being this world was gettingracially charged I saw what was going onin Chicago thinking why is it so badthere and then the whole thing theAffordable Care Act my insurance wentfrom great insurance that I didn't paythat much for but my deductible was verylow my prescriptions were very lowalmost a year after the Affordable CareAct gets jammed in in through anexecutive order the next time I had torenew my insurancethe premiums went up co-pays went up theminimums went up the deductibles so whatI may have had a $1,000 deductiblenow it's 3000 her family plan it's 6500who can afford that I went a couple ofyears without having insurance and I gotfined from the state that I'm in for nothaving insurance then I got hit againfor federally for not having insuranceand those two fines together were lessthan what I was paying for insurance soit's the lesser of two evils now we cantalk about the elections that werecoming up with Hillary versus Trump whenTrump first got into the ring I kind oflaughed going he's never gonna goanywhere this is kind of funny and as hestarts taking out one Republican afteranother and after another and afteranotherso he's found the nominee I'm like whoaI need to check into a few things I wentback looking up all sorts of videos fromhimI think that he was saying way back whenhe's on shell Donahue about thedirection that this country was goingbefore he even thought about running orbeing in politics everything that hesaid then is what he's saying now thereare so many other videos that are outthere of things that he said way beforeeven being in the political spotlightpeople really should check that out thenI start doing a lot of checking intoHillary Clintonand finding out how dirty she was howdirty the Clintons are then looked intomore things about the DemocraticNational Committee the things that theypulled the fact that the Democrats arethe ones have been holding us down forever they want us poor they want peopleof color to abort did children they arethe ones that are racist and the more Ilook into it the more I see how racistthey actually are I have not seen orheard anything come out of presidentTrump's mouth about rates I've neverheard him say anything disparaging Leeabout homosexuals he has it and it'scrazyI get so irritated watching themainstream media with him lying over andover and over one of the biggest thingsthat I witness washe's an augur Inauguration saying thatnobody was therewell they manipulated the folder thephotos to look like there was nobodythere but it was when it first startedwhen people started just going in theother thing that I've seen is that yourTrump says something if they don't putup the whole thing it'll just take alittle bit to get a sound bite to makehim look like he's racist homophobic andthen I'll go back and watch the wholevideo and see that's not what he wassayingso I talked to a few people and startedquestioning things and I had peoplesaying oh my god are you gonna supportDonald Trump are you crazy I had peoplecalling me out telling me they wouldnever talk to me again on Facebook I hadI was in different groups that peoplestarted throwing me out of groupstelling me that it couldn't be in thesegroups any more because I would notsupport Hillary Clinton well HillaryClinton was gonna be a terriblepresident and she was part of this ifthey want to call it New World Order ofjust taking over everything and takingour rights from us and I just I justcouldn't and now I find myself yes and Idid I did vote for Donald Trump and Iwill vote for Donald Trump again becauseI totally totally agree with protectingour borders having a wall giving usdifferent health care optionsderegulating a lot of things that he'sdone to help us well right now thenumber one supplier of oil and gas theUnited States is making money we're backin that world stage of being up therehe's not apologizing to anybody this ishow it is America's first and that's itand I know I'm going on a tangent herebut there's just so many things I get sofrustrated watching and listening topeople just saying that he is a racistwell how is he a racist show me thathe's a racist I haven't seen it showedthat he is anti-semitic he is not hisdaughterhe's married to a Jewish man sheconverted to Judaism she her children aJewish this is just more hate-filledlies that the left is doing it it tookme not a long time to find out all thestuff that the left was lying about andI ended up walking away when I went tothe voting booth and voted for DonaldTrump I will never ever ever againvote for Democrat they're not lookingout for us they're looking out forthemselves pizza[Music]
hi everybody I wanted to make a videobecause I got this in the mail todaymm-hmm I have never ordered a shirt or abumper sticker or anything for any typeof movement in my life not a politicalone nothing but I felt really inspiredby this movement and I wanted to show mysupport because it's I want people toask me because I feel emboldened andempowered now to state my opinion and aslong as you stay calm and respectfulthat I think that that can give us along ways and so I made a video backlike June 21st I think it was and I gota lot of support never done a video myentire life for anything I don't knowwhat came over me but you know it wasonly a 3,000 people in the group at thattime and now there's 163 which iswonderful awesome and if you guys didn'tsee that videoformer Bernie supporter lifelong liberalecho-chamber sjw the whole thing andcame to the conclusion that I was wrongabout about a lot of things and myassumptions I challenged myself andheard outside voices ben shapiro stevencrowder Dave Rubin the Joe Rogan podcastI have sort of a boring job so I get tolisten to podcasts all the time you knowthat long-form conversations are soimportant and I think a lot of us havecome from the same place the people thatare walking away from the left had neverbeen privy to that type of informationbecause it was just you know MSNBC CNNNew York Times Washington Post all thosekind of things that most of us havealways been privy to and YouTube hasmade a huge difference I think in a lotof people's lives because they're seeingthat that's humanizing theseconversationsthere's Britney's bringing nuance it'snot just memes you know and I thinkthat's wonderful and I hope that morepeople sort of look at both sides likethat like I did and I'm hoping that youknow we're looking at all these ralliesand everythingand these protests and I'm hoping thatour group I would go to a rally if wedid like a community outreach at thesame time because I think we really needto separate ourselves from you know justbeing against something being againstsomething all the time it's always justagainst it's like well what are you forbefore when I was on the left eyes verynihilistic Mike oh yeah just burn thewhole thing down and none of us workingfor anybody so just burn it all to theground and had no really idea what Iwanted specifically wanted to replacethe government with you know all of ourinstitutions it's just I just knew theywere wrong and I think that's a prettyimmature way to look at things you knowI was wrong about that and I thinkmoving forward it's a much healthier wayto look at it that we need to buildthings together and so if we're gonna doa rally you know do a community outreachget out there with garbage sacks andclean up your community wear your gearyou know have signs but be productiveyou know be a productive citizen and I'mloving getting to connect withconservatives who they very much thinkthat most of them very much think thatwaythey're very community oriented and Ireally appreciate that and so I'm hopingto bring that to my community you knowand be kind and respectful and just Iguess I'm a pragmatistyou know something else I didn't mentionin my other video was like where thoseideas had come from that I believed inlike questioning that you know thatrealizing a lot of the things I wasthinking was Marxist grace who is on thewalk away campaign she has a YouTubechannel called embarrassing mom and shewas a gender study major and she has awonderful breakdown if you guys want tocheck her out about where these ideasare coming from from the far left it'snot just out of nowhere I mean there'sit's so when you're trying to have aconversation with someone that's youknow on the left and they have a seem tohave a different vocabulary if there's avery specific place where the stuff iscoming from and so I think it's whoanybodyon the right to sort of look at that sothat you can have a more productiveconversation if you can have aconversation with people you know thatabout the identity politics and all thatkind of stuff that's pretty insane rightnow anyways I just also refill herefilled out my primary voter registeredvoter ballots and me my husband and wevoted red for the first time in ourlives pretty much down the ticket now Idid consider myself an independent andbut for the country and for bringing ustogether I think it's important toounless the Democrats you know come havea message can call out the extremists ontheir side I'm gonna have to voteRepublican for now I'm sorry that's justthe way it is I just I they with thesocialist stuff scare mea little bit and but for mostly I justwant to come to back together as youknow a country and have it okay to bepatriotic and yeah I think keep up thegood work I'm really impressed witheverybody's testimonials it has made meso hopeful and so grateful and made melove this country again and just want totake responsibility and do my partso anyways have a great day everybodymuch love bye

hey my name is delle striker and I lovethe walk away campaign and it's beensuch a blessing in my life I just wantedto share a video I posted July 23rd andtold about my walk away experiences butI've had to walk away from a lot ofthings in my life when I was 17 I walkedaway from my Jewish whole town and LongIsland went to college and went to threedifferent colleges made it that back toBerkeley and Berkeley was quite anexperience and that's when I decided towalk away from college and ended uphitchhiking back to New York sent to akibbutz in Israel with my first husbandand I had to walk away from my firstcommune because they actually asked usto leave for kissing in front of thedining room so I had to walk away a lotand I had to walk away from Israelaltogether and made it to Europehitchhiked through Europe and came backto the States and ended up in the OzarkMountains and found my people in theMidwest hard-working kind loving peopleand lots of hippies were part of theback-to-the-land movement and then Jesusfound me at 24 so then I had to walkaway from the hippie friends becausethey didn't want to hear about Jesus andthen I ended up coming to Florida and Ifound it past my own congregation andagain walking away from my family whodidn't accept it and walked away from myfirst marriage because he didn't get mehe thought finding other women was okayand I did that the second time I foundthe same thing happening again so I hadto walk away from my second marriage butmy walk away political moments cameearly on back in the Ozarks when I readnone dare call a conspiracyand found out that really the worldbanking system ran everything and thedark this was you didn't wind up withthe Bible's that made a lot of sense soit kind of walked away from politics itwasn't till I passed through the chirpsI decided to become a Republican andthey will pro-life so let's before thatand Bill Clinton already done slime andperversion in the Oval Office whicheveryone seems to have forgotten andthey pay him exhorted about some moneyto speak and his wife just sat therereally I woulda had a frying pan outwould hit him over the head somethingsome kind of box I'm sensing somehow Ithink their marriage wasn't what itlooked like and I walked away from thatand wasn't excited about Bush though wevoted Republican always if they're Prois real and they're pro-lifelet's go for it give it a chance that'slesser of two evils and then the HolySpirit woke me up in August right beforeTrump's election said I want you to prayfor Donald Trump I kind of said are youkidding I knew him I didn't know muchabout him and then I realized not onlyis God asking me to intercede for himand I didn't expect him to win theelection I better start studying andfinding out what really is going on inthe political world YouTube has beengreat dinesh d'souza anomalyforgetting it so lost in YouTube boomfrom place to place I found outeverything that I already knew that thedarkness was huge and great and thecorruption was huge and great enough topoint to be sickening it was very hardto adjust to getting all thatinformation in and keeping a prayer lifeat the same time but it stirred myprayer life up and got me on the righttrack so I thank God for waking me upthrough Donald Trump definitely wasapathetic I thought there was no hopefor the government I thought we're allgonna be trisexual by the time we'redone um I don't think I ever thought inmy daythat it would get this bad it'sinteresting when you're 68 I've alwaysthought Jesus was coming back at a timeon 50 so we'd have to face any of thisnow I have to realize the prayer lifeand your recession has to be more thanit's ever been because we are on thebrink of something and this walkawaycampaign had only its waking up peopledaily but that is stirring the earth andsaying this gonna be a great revivalthere's gonna be a great greatoutpouring of his spirit in his loveit's gonna be divine it's not gonna bethrough church it's gonna be divineintervention of God with people wakingthem up and I want to be part of it Iwant to be praying for it I care aboutmy children my grandchildreneveryone's grandchildren I care aboutAmerica own what America's been built onwhat stands for I care about Israel andhow Israel finally has a friend andfinally has a president that has theguts to move the embassy and we have thepresident's first daughter in the WhiteHouse Jewish married to a Jew raisingthree Jewish children helloso I also want to share what it's liketo be a liberal liberalism is a diseaseit's a mental disorder it's also areligion and so people are really reallyupset that their religion is beingshipped to the core my faith and mybeliefs have always been shook a wholething my life and I started realizingthat really if I just think oppositethen I did as a hippie at age 23 gettingsaved at 24 that that's probably whatJesus would say what Jesus would do soI've been used to this but for peoplewho are not and believed in thiscorruption all these years just shake inthe very core of them the Bible saidthere's gonna be weeping and gnashingyour teeth we're getting hell is burpingis what's going on that's what's goingon the media they've gone crazy they'remad they're they're beyond logic thereis no logic to any ofbut in it in the darkness and in theugliness more people are running awayfrom the Democratic Party more peopleare getting awake and this is a chancefor a great revival this is a chance tobe a prayer warrior this is a chance tobe awake and studying and learning Imean there won't even be YouTube leftwe're gonna need books it's not a badtime to start saving books but we reallyneed each otherwe need to stand for the truth I don'treally want to hear about the media I'venever been a media person with thehippies we knew the media wasn't goodwas was faked back then how come some ofmy hippie friends hook line sinkerbelieve the mediaI got no idea we knew then that theywere teaching how to dress they wereteaching you what to wear they wereteaching you how to think that's whatthe whole Pippi movement was aboutknowing that the establishment wascorrupt I'm trying to push an agenda Idon't know what happened to peopleexcept complacency and I'd have becomecomplacent too I had going there's nohope why bother praying so I'm veryexcited for this campaign I just want toshare my heart I want to remind peoplethat what's going on in liberalism outof them now the heart speaketh so what'scoming out people's mouths is what's intheir heart and the only hope they haveis Jesus Christ the only hope they haveis salvation because the heart has tochange before the thoughts change andthe mind changes so thank you forwatching and I pray you have a blessedday that you start influencing morepeople that you

greetings in love a'tall you walk awayerrs out there who are assumed to be therunaway movement because it's runningaway like the runaway trump train now Ithink it's said 140,000 that it'sreached up I've been communicating withthis site since it started a littleEaster when I found out about it whichwas like July 2nd I suppose I don't knowhow long it's gone on but I've done someletters that had a hard time beingpublished through a series of mishapsand problems and also now I've had myvideo line that's gonna be on YouTubeand I put a longer version that's gonnabe on YouTube that was 25 minutes long alot of people have long ones on here butmine was keeps getting rejected for somereason so now there's all of a suddensaying everyone's has to be shorter soI'm making the short one with the timeron and I just have a lot of stuff tocover that I can talk about him 54 yearsold it was a Democrat most of my life Iwas in the Air Force at 17 years olduntil 21 and learned a lot about thegovernment and a lot about the world andthe way things work and when you're ontalking to people on this site they'rereading what people say in this site youknow a lot of the people are youngerpeople who all they know is Obama andBernie and you know the more recentstuff that's gone out of our countrythey're not really aware of well they'renot aware of the history of this countryvery much at all a lot of times you seethis on the some of the newer shows orthey ask you to fight the RevolutionaryWar who fought the Civil War they don'tknowyou literally know almost nothing so umit's very important for people to learnthat there's a historical political andmost importantly spiritual element toall of this my wife and I both have Lymedisease she's had it since 74 and I'vehad it since 94 and what I see happeningwith this walkaway movement is thatpeople are very sort of in shock they'rethey're surprised at the level ofanimosity and hatred that's falling outof people at them in their own familiesand this is something that we strangelyare used to because people with Lymedisease have their own line communityit's all worldwide and when you haveLyme disease it's very much like theearly days of AIDS where there's anextreme attack that goes along with itwhere you're not just sick and dying orfeeling bad you're brutally attacked bythe medical community by your familyyou're ostracized you're accused ofthinking for how sick you are it's anamazing experience to go through but ittrains you in what spiritual warfare iswe're experiencing in our society rightnow is an unparalleledspiritual war that's taking place andit's very serious and it's very powerfuland this is why people are having such astrong reaction to this walkawaymovement because this is a movement

what's going on America this is Kevinand Kevin's corner and it looks likepeople are walking away from the dimrattle I would sing the second verse butI don't know the worst I'm pretty sureit's just hallelujah all the way throughbut nonetheless you get the point okayyeah they're leaving they're walkingaway and they should cuz these boots aremade for walkin that's just what they'lldo one of these days demo rats they'regonna walk all over you let me getfocused now the reason that this ishorrible for the demo rats is becausethese people that are walking awayleaving their testimonies are the worstpeople to walk away from the Democratsbecause see these people fit everystereotype every small interest groupevery identity politics category thatthe Democrats build their whole platformaround see it would be one thing ifpeople were walking away and there wereupper-class rich white men you know allthe libs would be like you know what howare you gonna walk away from somethingthat you never was a part of in thefirst placeyou weren't really with us because yourwhite privilege man you're not walkingaway we're kicking out or even as ablack person you know a brother whomight not have come from say hey youknow the culture hate will you knowdidn't come from Beverly Hills orsomething like that they you know theythey let you know well you know youcan't walk away you know what you areyou're still out to your own people manyou which your your your your your UncleTom your cool all of that stuff they tryto use those things to shame people likeyou know a per class white man even evenupper class white women you know theythey they just feel like you know you'redoing your people disservice fromwalking weight you know what you areyou're just being controlled by yourhusbandyou can't think for yourself but youhave people of all races colorsethnicitiessexual orientation I was watching somevideos and it was some transgenderpeople and they were just talking abouthow they felt like they have beenmanipulated all of these years by theDemocratic Party they said they didn'tsee these are people that you can't sitback and say you know what they werenever down with the Democrats anywaythese were people who was out theresocial justice warriors crying afterHillary loss you know thrown a fit andthen they start realizing that when itcomes down to the leftyou are only accepted based on yourloyalty to them see real friends theydon't walk away from you just becauseyou just disagree with them that's whatthey but the Democrats know see you'reonly a transgender if you support all ofthe transgender beliefs in theirecho-chamber soon is one of them say youknow what this is ridiculous why am iman I'm just walking around man fornothing cuz y'all told me I should bemad and as soon as they declare thatthen all of a sudden they don't want tobe affiliated with them anymoresame thing with black people now peopleare starting to realize what blackpeople been going through all theseyears when they decide to leave theDemocratic plantation immediately theythey feel that they got a corner amarket share of blackness so if youain't down with the Democrats they takeyour black card they start calling y'allkind of name it schooling racist UncleTom wellcan't call you racist but you know withall all those other words they like tocall us and now transgenders arestarting to see that they're beingpersecuted for it the guy who started itthe whole walk away movement he saidthat I saw him warned of judge Jeaninehe said he went in to buy some recordingequipment and they wouldn't even servehim and that that just shows howhorrible the left is in this progressivemovement because they talk about youknow dictatorships that talk about ohyou know what this is fascism and theypractice the same stuff that they accusethe the right of doing and the right isvery very tolerant when it comes down toembracing people of different racesethnicity sexual orientation it's notabout all that stuff it's about how yourespect everybody else and how you viewaAmerica and some of the values that wehave I don't care what you do in theprivacy of your own home I'm not here tochase you down until you know whatyou're you're not you're not rightbecause you did this and you did thatI'm like look man let me be but that'sthe difference see the left feel likethey gotta walk around fine and victimsand it just goes from one victim toanother it's never okay we found enoughvictims guys let's go ahead and wrap itup no no they're going okay we're stillout here safe searching for more victimsand they go from one victim to the nextand not only that they like to get inyour business now why would you want tobe a part of an organization a movementa party they want to get all in yourbusiness they want to get in your healthcare they want to get in your religionthey want to get into your speech theywant to get into your first and secondAmendment they want to get into everyelement of your life they want to getinto your brain and they say if youdon't think like we think they can'tjust say we disagreeyou're evil you know what you're racistas it aful hugga for your all of thesethings you're not just a person whodisagrees you're not just a person whocomes up with logical practicingpolicies no you're an evil wicked personand then you wonder why people arewalking away from the Democrats indroves and I'm so glad that they'rewaking up because the Democrats are fullof garbage why would you want to be apart of them when all they do is walkaround being mad for nothing they arethe most angriest and tolerant people onthe planet at this point and it's allbeing propagated by the left and when Isay the left I'm not talking about thepeople remember the people runningaround are victims of this manipulationand these are the people a lot of themthat are walking away they're openingtheir eyes and say man I have beenmanipulated I have been being used andthey have been preying upon my anger myinsecurities my fears they're creatingall these narratives that they tell me Ineed to buy - they're telling me that Imust think like this because I'm blackor I'm gay or I'm a lesbian or a Jewthey're telling me how to think and thatis stinking thinkingokay and I don't like no stinkingthinking all right I'm an individual Ican think what I want to think and Idon't care if they call me all kind ofnames and the right isn't racing all ofthese people that are saying I'm wakingup and I'm walking on over to the to thelight I'm coming into the light okay soanyway I chuckle I laugh even though nowthey're trying to suppress it I know oneperson she did a video and now they'rereferencing that these must be RussianBOTS not all of these testimonies aretrue these are just the Russians onceagain everything's Russians it's theRussians they've gotten involvingthey're manipulating the system yeahthey're doing a preemptive strike on thepeople who are walking away because theycan't afford to take off they can'tafford it to become a real movement cuzthat messes up their our whole strategyremember outside of them telling youyou're a victim you know what this issexism this is racismthis is xenophobia this is you know whatI heard somebody say a phobia means it'san unhealthy unwarranted fear ofsomething the stuff that they're tryingto out fear homosexuals I don't fearillegal immigrants I don't fear anybodythere you know and so they're runningaround creating fears you know fear isfalse evidence appearing real they'recreating fears I'm just thinkinglogically just because I disagree withthe legal immigration you know I'm notan illegal folk you know I'm none ofthose things just because maybe certainpeople's / lifestyle that they practiceI might not practice that don't make mehomophobic xenophobic or whatever itjust makes me say well whatever suitsyou buddymight have at it I'm gonna do whatever Ido but it doesn't have to come down tojust because you disagree that must meanyou're fearful of it I'm going you'rejust making up stuff winging it you'rejust looking for reasons to be mad and Ithink people are starting to wake up andsay wait a minute I'm just walkingaround angry all the time how can youlive your life like thathow could you just wake up every day andsay let me go find more problems be madabout and things just fuss about and youknow what I'm gonna do I'm

to be done and how theythinking how evil they are but I'm notgonna give any solutions I'm not gonnagive any solutions so why would anybodywant to follow a party that that's thebase of the operation

hi my name is alexthis is my walk away videoi'm walking away from the democraticpartyi can no longer condone what thedemocrats are doingtheir lies their deceit they are corruptjust like the media but i'm paid forby the left i always said toothat the deadliest virus in americais the mediai'm putting my 100 support behind trumphe is what's best for this countrynot the democrats joe biden kamalaharristhey won't help us they will destroy us[Music]trump 2020
hi everybody my name is Brie I've beenwatching everybody's videos and beenreally inspired by them so I decided tomake my own I have always been a liberalvery liberal probably far-leftI was a Bernie supporter and Ireluctantly voted for Trump because ofwhat happened to Bernie in the primariesyou know I remember the first Clintonand I just couldn't get behind HillaryClinton so what made me start walkingaway was after the election the completehysteria like the world was endingcoming from the left from my sidecalling people names racist bigots lowIQ voters you know and I'm like I votedfor Trump I'm none of those things I'mnot a racist I'm not a bigot anotherhomophobe I have no problem with anybodyyou know live and let live that's whatI've always thought and you knowtreating conservatives like second-classcitizensand seeing it online sing it person I itI was disgusted by it I'm like I thoughtwe were supposed to be tolerant andloving and that's not what I was seeingat all and so my brother who was alittle further along in his journey thanme sent me some video some YouTubevideos on like social justice warriorswhich I used to be one completely demondidn't even know itI was completely part of that echochamber you know sharing just stupidarticles and you know thinking Americawas the worst country in the worldyou know colonialization all of that youknow when I had no idea where thatactually came from and so I startedresearching and realizing that a lot ofthe things I thought and a lot of thingsI believed were Marxist straight up KarlMarxI read Karl Marx you know started realreading history and I'm embarrassed tosay you know supporting a socialist andnot even knowing what that meantand how it's been horrendous for a lotof countries you know I read Mao's GreatLeap Forward Gulag Archipelago aboutwhat happened in Russia you know I cameacross Jordan Peterson and ret you knowlistened to a ton of his YouTube videosand just realized what I was spewing outand how that is going to end up tearingthe country apart because it's alloppressor vs. oppressed and it's nothelpful for anybody it makes me reallysad actually because if you're alwaysthinking your victim then there'snothing you can do and you're tellingpeople of color and gay people thatthey're victims you know saying youright out of the gate you have no shot Ijust think it's sad and I am NOT for itand I am glad that I've sort of seen thelight because you know like JordanPeterson says you know clean up your ownroom before you know get your own lifein order before you go out and try tochange the world and so that's what I'vetaken on for myself it's just how can Imake my small little world better myneighborhood you know be the mom thatall the kids can come over to her houseyou know watch out for each other youknow just within your small littlemicrocosm of the world because typing ona keyboard and being nasty to people isnot going to help anybody it's justgonna make the climate you know worseand another thing I realize thisconservatives aren't evil they just havea different way of looking at things andwhen you just assign you know evil badto somebody just because of an opinionyou'll never listen to what they have tosay and so I've really you know once Istart educating myself realized that youknow we are all a human we are all juston our own path most of us love ourfamilies we just want the best foreverybody andso what if we have different opinions onpolicy I won't be judging anybody forthat anymoreand but I and I also won't be getting onthe calling liberals name trains eitherbecause I you know I see it from bothsides that doesn't help you know so allI can do is educate myself on issues andtry to look at both sidesI'm definitely landing more classicalliberal now you know moderate centriston the right on a lot of stuff now youknow pro-second amendment Pro freespeech which is actually a conservativething now crazyshould we should all want that you knowreading history like I said helps toknow where we came from you know what wefought forit's it's really important yes but thishas been very humbling but I have hopeand it starts with each one of us justdoing what we can in our little areas Imean so I guess yeah that's all we cando and yeah I won't be voting for aparty that calls everybody racists andNazis and I'm hoping the hysteria willdie down because it's reallydisheartening you know I can't this is asecond YouTube Facebook channel becauseI can't even go on my regular Channelthis you know my facebook feed is justcancer it's just people hating on eachother I'm not gonna have I I like peoplewhen I'm in a you know when you'rearound people face to face they're nicepeople are generally good you get onsocial media and it's just a cesspool Ican't even do Twitter yeah so I'm justnot gonna I'm not going to do it thiscampaign has sort of made me hopefulbecause reading people's comments andseeing that people can have a dialoguewith each other even though you knowmaybe somebody's protip pro-choicepro-life they're not being awful to eachand that's how we should be and that'syou know I'm hoping that we can getthereso anyways keep up the good workeverybody I really enjoy your videos andyeah I'll be looking forward to thefuture so bye

[Music]i want to share my walk away story withyou guys in hopes that it might helpsomebody elsewalk away uh or help somebody else justfeel like they've been validated becausethat's what this movement has donefor me so growing up as a kid mydad was the type of person who justdidn't share their political views backthen nobody really talked aboutwhat they believed in or who they votedfor and when i turned 18it was kind of a rite of passage uh youknow when i went to vote for the firsttime my dadyou know outed that he was aconservative uh you know and and growingupi've i always felt a sense of pride uhyou knowespecially with the star-spangled bannerand the pledge of allegiance you knowthey they even playedthe star spangled banner every morningin school and wesaid the pledge of allegiance and iremember having that sense ofpride uh for being an american and then9 11 happened when i was a junior inhigh schooland i remember that feeling and it wasthe first time that i really didn't feelsafe in america um it was a scaryday it was a scary time and you know iremember those times i remember you knowwhythat war started and in this war that'sgone onfor so long it seems like it doesn'thave an ending soyou know i was a democrat because ididn't want i didn't really like mydad's values i guess i was youngkind of rebellious so of course you knowi didn'twant to just go with what he said so i ibecame a democrat you know i thoughtit was the party of acceptance and andthat's who i am as a person i accepteveryone as long as they don't doanything to me i don't i don't careabout you know the color of your skin oror who you choose to worship andand have faith in and i don't care whoyou love i loveeveryone uh the same we're we're allamericans we're all humansand so i thought that's what thedemocratic party was aboutso i voted for obama the first termi did not vote at all the second termfor him i didn't agreehe didn't bring the hope and change isaw a lot of things that i didn't likebut it still didn't you know kind oflink that to the democratic party i justthought okaywell hopefully in 2016 we'll have abetter candidatewell we didn't so i didn't vote inthat election either because i was ademocrat and i really didn't know abouttrump i thought maybeum you know he he was just playing agame oryou know whatever i mean the mediacoverage about him i believed all of thestuff they were sayingso you know after he was elected thoughi started to realizethat you know some of the things thatthey were saying justweren't true and i started to really seethe attacks and not just the attacks ontrumpthe attacks on people who supportedtrump and for mei was like hey you know that that's notthe way that we're supposed to bethinking that's not what we stand forand and why are we attacking thesepeople but they're not attackingus not as much anyway and they're notbeingviolent and there's not these hategroups uh forminguh of trump supporters right and so ireally started to listen to what trumpwas actually sayingand i started to really start to agreewith what he was sayingbut i thought maybe i was a little crazyi was really really scareduh to to debate anybody or talkabout any of it until i saw brandon'swalk away video andit touched me deep down in my soulbecause he really validated everythingthat i had been feelinghe validated that it's okay to walk awayfrom something that you just don'tbelieve inand so after i saw his video i was soexciteduh you know the first thing i did wascall my dad and tell him heyi'm not you know i'm not a democratanymore i'm goingto register as a you know aa conservative and i wassuper excited uh you know to kind ofjoin this movement and start talking topeoplebut when i started talking to peoplethey started treating me horriblycalling me names calling me a racist idon't havea racist bone in my body uh you knowit's justall kinds of really vile things and sothis group the people in this thiscommunity reallyuh in the walk away campaign they reallymade me feelvalidated and i have never felt so muchlove and acceptanceuh and and had good debates with peopleeveruh before meeting people in this thiscommunity and it's beenamazing amazing i've met some such goodfriendsand we are seeing the democratic partyjustgo insane like some of the things thatthey are sayingand doing it's just crazy and andthey're acting like childrenand i just think that we need better wedeservebetter and it really feels like thedemocratic party now is really justagainst americaall together and what we stand for and iilook back and i remember that pride andi remember being prouduh and i haven't felt that in a longtime untili went to a trump rally and i actuallygot to meet brandon there and heis the most genuine person ever the imean he's just amazing he'sreal uh so when i was at when we were atthe trump rallyi felt that feeling of being patrioticagaini felt that feeling of being proudagainst to be an americanand that's something that i don't idon't want to lose and i don't want tolet goso that's my walk away story and my walkwith storyis it doesn't matter who you are to thisthis group of peopleuh that have decided to walk away itdoesn't matter you'reyou can we all have different views andwe all have different opinions aboutthings andyou know we all we all are differenthumans we're different people with withour own brains and we can think forourselvesand the one thing that i can say aboutthis community and the people that ichoose to walk with nowis that even if we don't agree we canagree to disagree and we can have a goodyou know healthy debate and we can moveon it's notthe end of friendships or the end of youknow the worldif you don't agree with someone so mywalk with storyis that anybody in here

what's up guys you know what so I can'tleave this walkaway campaign aloneI want to capitalize while you knowstrike while the iron is hot I didn'twant to include this in my videoyesterday just because I didn't want itto be too long but there is one otherhuge elephant in the roomas far as reasons why I walked away fromthe Democratic Party and I will neverever vote for the Democratic Party againand that reason is the myth that theparty switched at some point alonghistory in America that the DemocraticParty and Republican Party magically dida big switch and the Democrats the badguys suddenly became the good guys andthe Republicans were the good guys andwent from the good guys to be in the badguys that southern strategy that RichardNixon wanted to campaign in the southjust to be competitive is a myth and thefact that I was taught that in schoolknowing that the facts are out therethat the party's never switched is itjust pisses me off you know it's just afurther validation that the publicschool system is failed the fact thatthe government controls theindoctrination they control thecurriculum therefore they control thenarrative you know it makes you wonderwhat our kids learning today that we'regonna see down the road is a lie they'regonna wake up and realize wow I wasduped they told me Donald Trump was afascist they told me Barack Obama wasone of the greatest presidents inhistory kids could very well be learningthat right now I don't have kids rightnow but when I do you best believe I'lleither be homeschooling them or sendingthem to private school or charterschools something else they're not goingto public school just because it's it'ssuch a fallacy that you know you canteach someone whatever you want them tolearn and the parents have no say-so init you know the curriculum is all messedup so anyway I don't want to get off onthe tangent I want to talk about how theDemocrat and Republican Party neverswitched and I don't need all of thedates and all the historical facts forit because it's just so plain to see youknow how about this we all know theRepublican Party was founded in 1854 inopposition to slavery right to keep itfrom expanding to the West and you knowthe civil the civil war happened as aresult of it and they won and theRepublican Partyported the 13 14 and 15 amendments forslaves you know free in the slavesmaking them citizens allowing them tovote the Democratic Party was against itagainst all three of those amendmentsright then you have the first blackpolitician ever was Republican MartinLuther King was a Republican you knowthe only reason that there was a switchwas the black voter switched from theRepublican Party to the Democratic Partyso the only strategy that reallyhappened was the welfare strategy that'sright the LBJ Act I believe it was 1964the Great Society act where he realizedokay well blacks are voting now so thatmeans that their vote makes a differencewe have to figure out a way to get themI'm probably butchering the quote but hepretty much said you know I'll havethose in words vote Democrat for thenext 200 years we have to give himsomething but not enough to make adifference so insert the Great Societywelfare act and then ever since thatWelfare Act single motherhood in theblack community is up like 73 percentsince the 1960s also the PlannedParenthood you know Margaret Sanger waslike a lady Ku Klux Klan member and shetalked about eugenics and how blackpeople need to be controlled by weedsthese are all facts that you guys canlook up you know for anybody that'sgonna come in the comments section talkabout this walk away movement there'speople bragging about going fromDemocrat to Republican it's not evenabout that it's about breaking away fromthe narratives you know detachingyourself from your victimhood status thesacred cows status has been given to youby the Democrats and become a sovereignfree-thinking individual that you wereborn to be it's your divine purpose tobe a free-thinking independent person soback to this whole Democrat Republicanswitch right so you had Margaret Sangerwith Planned Parenthood which by the wayPlanned Parenthood's are mostly inminority communities go look across allof America they're mostly in minoritycommunities eugenics is a real thingthey're actually doing eugenics inIceland right now but eugenics inAmerica was used to you knowexterminate the black race and with theWelfare Act that was passed by LBJ youknow that got black people votingDemocrat but the difference is they hadto get the parent out of the home thefather out of the home so what did thatdo that means kids were growing upwithout a parent without their fatherand then you incentivize single mothersto marry the government and then fathersweren't able to get jobs they werelocked up and then insert Bill Clintonin the nineties with his crime bill actsupported by Democrats not supported byRepublicans see it's coincidence rightright you're gonna say the party switchyet the Republicans have had theirfingerprints all over everything havingto do with freedom they've always beenthe party of freedom the DemocraticParty has always been the party ofslavery Jim Crow KKK all the segregationlaws you know they voted against all ofthe civil rights legislation theyfilibustered stuff you know thatfilibuster rule was made famous byDemocrats you know so Bill Clinton withhis crime bill locked up more black menthan any other president in UnitedStates history okay so the I mean thehistorical facts are there but if peoplewant to deny the historical facts okaylet's talk about modern-day DemocraticParty modern-day slavery modern-dayslave plantations okay so use the eyetest go to any mostly black Democrat runcity you know your Cleveland yourChicago

hello everyone so today I'm gonna sharewith you my walkaway story I've beenwatching some of your some of yourWalker weight stories and inspired me toshare mine so here it is so I grew up inNorthern California very liberal part ofthe country I was raised by a veryliberal minded family on my mother'sside I went through the Californiapublic school system my whole life whichas you can imagine this in the mostpro-america minded organization in thecountry and as a 20 21 22 year old I wastrying to get my feet underneath me andsupport myself but I just couldn't finda job couldn't find a job my mom at thetime couldn't find a job she was veryqualifiedshe was very qualified she had a lot ofexperience in a very prominentwell-thought-out popular field and inthat state but couldn't find a job atthe time though work force participationrate was the hot was the lowest that ithad been in 40 years at this time theunemployment rate where I was living atin in Sacramento California was was veryhigh and all that I heard from anyonewas that it's all the Conservativesfalse and one day the penny just droppedfor me and I you know realized you knowthere aren't any there aren't anyconservatives here where this place isrun by Liberal Democrats these problemsare caused by Liberal Democrats um on myanalysis of liberal ideology of theDemocratic Party's ideology I agree withthem on the on the ends of things but Idon't always agree with them on themeans to those ends I think that themeans that they're implementing causegreater problems and actually lead themfarther away than what they're actuallytrying to accomplish you know they wanteveryone to have health insurance theywant everyone to be healthy they wanteverybodyto have a doctor I like that idea Ithink that's a good idea but I don'tagree with the means of giving moremoney to the government to pay forthings well equate to the problem wethat's just more of the same thing thatwe have been doing we were you knowspending trillions of dollars on thisproblem isn't going to make the problemgo away when we tried spending billionson it and millions on itthe problem isn't a lack of governmentspending it's a lack of we're formingthe system okay you know the democraticparties say that there for women'srights there for protecting women Ithink that's a great idea but they onlybut they minimize women's rights toabortions and and getting free birthcontrol right women have freedom ofspeech Democratic Party doesn't defendthat women have a right to protectthemselves how they have a right to owna gunDemocratic Party is trying to suppressthat women have private property rightswomen owned businesses women have moneywomen rely on businesses to survive andthe Democratic parties just just triedto suppress and to stop that it'sthey're in the business of taking wealthfrom people taking wealth from womenmanipulating markets to benefit marketsin the economy to benefit the rulingelite over everybody else over thesewomen who own businesses over you knowor if they don't own businesses isn'tbusinesses that women rely on to surviveright they're all about suppressing thatright the Democratic Party says thattherefore fighting for theafrican-american community and providingthem justice and social justice I thinkthat's a good idea but then againthey're the African American communityhas freedom of speech with the deafwhich the Democratic Party is trying tocensor and and stop the African Americancommunity has you know owns weapons wehave the Democratic Party is trying totake guns away from them the AfricanAmerican community has has money but theDemocratic Party is just always tryingto take more money from them throughtaxation or the african-americancommunity owns businesses or they orthey rely on businesses to survive butyeah the Democratic Party is all aboutmanipulating the markets to benefityou know the ruling elite over everybodyelse the Democratic Party says thattherefore you know the common individualand against the big bad evilcorporations and I think that can be agood idea but then they go ahead andthey support systems like the FederalReserve banking system which givesmonopoly power on creating the world'sreserve currency to a group of smallelitist bankers whose identities wedon't know right today's thereforesystems like the export-import bankwhich is a system created by the federalgovernment which does nothing other thangive huge loans to major corporationswith money from the common individualright there for other crony capitalistlegislation like increasing you knowlike investing the people's money andbusinesses which is very cronycapitalist I don't support so at thattime I decided to walk away from theleft and I consider myself conservativehowever I don't think that the battle inpolitics is left versus right or red vs.blue Republican versus DemocratI think the a better description of thebattle and politics is really top downit's really vertical it's really thepeople at the top of the system peoplewho work for the government people whorun businesses who are manipulatinggovernment to benefit them they'recentralizing more power to them versusthe people the common individual personwho doesn't have connection to that tothat system to that network that's wherethe battle is and the debate is I thinkthe you know I think the a gooddescription of the problem isn't left orliberal but it's statist statistis involved in both political partiesyou know the status say that thesolution say that the reason why youdon't have a good life the reason whythings are hard for you is because thepeople at the top of the system don'thave enough money and power to makeeverything fair and equal and balancedforeverbuddy and only and if only you wouldjust give them more of your money andlet them control more aspects of yourlifewell everything for you and everybody atthe bottom of the pyramid become betterwhich isn't true by the more that wecentralize more money to the state orpower to the state the worse that thingsget for people at the bottom and I thinkwhat we need to be doing is we need tobe reforming the systems reforming thegovernment reforming the way reformingthe relationship between government andbusiness so that it works better forpeople it's more so it works better forpeople and it's more an appropriaterelationship and between governmentbusiness and allow

infringe on myrights and my family's rights and myfriends rights and my fellow Americansrights that's where we're gonna have aproblem because more and more people aregonna be walking away because they don'twant to get beat up they don't want toget threatened they don't want to becalled names they don't want to betreated like second-class citizens theydon't want their public servants onlyserving half the countrythe only thing that is going to savethis country is love and an acceptanceand understanding that we're alldifferent but we're all the sameyoutaking me quite a while to get up mycourage to make this video I joined thewalkway movement when I was practicallyapproximately say 3,800 people and thereason I joined the walkway movement wasbecause I walked away I was a lifelongDemocrat and towards the end of not eventowards the end I'd say I voted forPresident Obama twice but somewhere inhis second termI started feeling disillusioned I didn'tlike what I was seeing going on in ourcountry there's a lot of things I livefive minutes from Baltimore and I couldsee what was happening there but whatreally gave me my walk away was adisillusioned moment and what happenedwas I was exploring the the candidatesbecause I knew I wasn't gonna vote forHillary Clinton because I had watchedHillary's America and some other thingsand I was completely not absolutely notjust like I never voted for Barack Obamabecause it was black I wasn't gonna votefor Hillary Clinton because she was awoman I don't like that that is never adetermining factor I don't make choicesbased on sex or race or sexualorientation or anything like thatthat's not how I make my decisions soanyway I was watching I decided I wasgonna watch a trump rally because Iheard so much prop about him and so muchnegativity and whatnot and just onFacebook because like I said I don'treally watch TV and I definitely don'twatch mainstream media and never Ihaven't for a while but anyway so I saidI'm gonna watch this Trump rally I'mgonna see what's going on he almost whoeverybody you know what's going on soimagine my surprise when the rally wascanceleddue to threats of violence I couldn'tbelieve it I was like wait a minutethis is the United States of America andyou know if you don't want to hearsomebody speak you just don't go if youdon't want to partake of informationthat you don't feel be beneficial to youyou just don't listen or if you reallywant to be informed you listen and youtake it in and then you decide what youwant to do with that informationat least that's you know what I do andthat's what I believe so when I saw thatI said why is going on why would threatsof violence and I got on my laptop and Istarted looking on YouTube and pullingup all these videos that weren't on thenews even though I turned on themainstream media and I can't rememberwhat station was I couldn't even tellyou who the people were that we'retalking but um the next thing I knewwhat I was seeing on the screen and whatthey were talking about were two totallydifferent things I was seeing innocentpeople husbands wives children you nameit being verbally attacked physicallyassaulted things thrown at them um andI'm like who is doing this it was youknow what's killing of what why arethese people being attacked it's how Igot on my computer like I said in it Icouldn't believe what I saw these wereDemocrats I was a Democrat I freaked outI was like I was terrified for thesepeople I said I was like how in thegreatest country on Earth in the UnitedStates of America are people not allowedto go to a rally they hear someone speakand then as my journey that nightbecause I stayed up late that night Istarted seeing all these other thingswhere things going on college campusesandand violence and radicalism and allthese people were doing this under theumbrella of the Democrats wellimmediately I I just couldn't believe itI I said I can't believe this is theDemocratic Party that I belong to andthen I said well let me see I knew theDemocratic Party or at least you knowthose in power and Democrat rightthey're denouncing this they have to beno now they were not denouncing it I wasyou've got to be kidding menobody in the in it you know as a DNC orany of these Democratic senators orprogramnobody is saying anything the Presidentof the United States is not sayinganything about people American citizensbeing attacked physically attacked fortheir political views or who knows whatpolitical affiliation these people werethey were going to a rally to hearsomeone speak we don't know if therewere Republicans or independents orlibertarians or demography we don't knowyou know you can't tell just by lookingat somebody what their politicalaffiliation is so mm-hmmI was upset and the next day I went onthe internet and I removed myself fromthe Democratic Party I said they're notgonna stand up to this and they're notgonna say hey you know these people weredoing this under the umbrella of theDemocratic Party but we do not condonepeople go into a trump rally being theircars being vandalized and beingassaulted and whatnot and you know whooif you're not going up well they say youyou you you know you stand for nothingyou fall for anything well to me I feltlike the Democratic Party was by notcondemning this violence and theseassaults they were condoning it and Idon't care if you hate Donald Trump Idon't care if you don't like him youthinkhe's you know um he's not polished andoffer he's he's too brash or whatever Idon't care that doesn't give you theright to assault people so not reallyknowing the political climate as well asI should have I feel like you know Ifeel like I was always that proverbialostrich with their head and his sandbecause of course like I said at first Ididn't want to leave it was DemocraticParty doing this and in second Icouldn't believe that wasn't beingcondemned and then I said I can't be apart of this and the next day I wentonline and I removed myself from theDemocratic Party I said until they gettheir act together I'm out I do notbelieve in violence I don't believe inattacking people but then I startedseeing all people's Facebook pages cuzmy brother I have a brother who is astaunch Republican I mean he is he is apatriot 100% he is all American butanyway I started seeing all these peopleattacking other people on Facebook andlike viciously attacking people on therejust for their opinions even if somebodysaid something as simple as you know Ithink I'm gonna you know consider mr.Trump I'm gonna go to you know read hisplatform what are you guys I mean familyagainst family brothers and sistersagainst the parents against childrenchildren against parents and then I sortof find out about all this stuff onthese college campuses that these kidsin college were being basicallybrainwashed by these so-callededucators and then fast forward to nowwe have actual politicians who weresupposed to work for everyone in thecountry standing up with a microphonetelling people to harass other peopleno you can't eat here no you can't getguests here no you can't shop here youneed to go somewhere else because you'rea trump supporter or your your you knowyou're not a Democrat so in other wordsyou only represent a half of the countryyou don't represent the whole country noyou're in the wrong job you need toretire and go mix knit yourself somescarves or something or find a hobbybecause honey a public servant servesthe public not just the ones that theywant to support this is ridiculous Icannot believe I still cannot wrap myhead around the fact that I wasterrifiedto make this video because I was afraidas an author and a writer an independentwriter author that I'm going to gettrashed on Amazon Goodreads becausepeople

[Music]good morning walk away movement I hopeyou all are doing well this weekendI know it's been such a tough time and Iwas watchingBrandon struts video over the weekendand he asked those of us who are eithera walk with or a walk away to do a videoI am a walk with for the most part Ihave voted Republican since college myfirst time to vote was in thepresidential election and I did vote forBill Clinton and obviously haveregretted that ever since what has ledme in my life to be a Republican isbecause I had family members who ownbusinesses and were ranchers and justseeing the importance of having somebasic liberties and also to not be taxedto where you can't reach your fullpotential and so as I've gotten older itwent beyond the principles of justfiscal issues to social issues for meand wanting to protect the unborn andjust I think also just respect for lifeand liberty has just become so importantto me and it's been really proven to bea principle that just is essential for asuccessful country we are rapidly losingour liberties through the shutdownprocess and I'm just so concerned aboutthat and so I'm very grateful for ourgovernor McMaster who is starting toopen up our state and we're going to goto Savannah today this show support forgovernor camp and it's tough I mean andno one's probably going to look great ina crisis and but I think at the end ofthe day we need to let our bizmake some decisions for themselves andlet the individuals to this is one ofthe reasons why I am a conservative it'sto conserve life and liberty and I havelike other members of this movement lostfriends over the years because of myvalues and beliefs and even though wedidn't talked about them they just knewI was a Republican and so because ofthat I had some friends just they walkedaway from me and it's painful it doeshurt and what I have decided to do isthe doors always open and I think abouthow Brandon kept the door open for hisfriend in Nebraska she kept the dooropen to him which led to this movementif she had unfriended him on Facebook hewould not have found evidence of thebias in the media against our presidentand so I think that keeping the dooropen keeping the lines of communicationeven if people don't agree with us andthey leave if even if they're not supernice either about itand if they are a friend they will comeback and if not it's okay to let them goand I just think this movement iswonderful so proud of Brandon hiscourage and his strength and energy andI just hope you all will be finethe situation actually will be more thanfine we'll come out victorious on theother side of this and I think theprinciples of life and liberty are whatwill unite us all we are not perfect theRepublican Party is not perfect justlike there's no such thing as a perfectfamily a perfect church perfect personso we have to give each other a lot ofgrace and forgiveness and mercy and justhold to thosefounding principles of life and libertyand I will add love into that as welland though that is what will keep ustogether and make our movementsuccessful I wish you all a very happySunday and I hope we get to the otherside of this year very soonlove you all goodbye

hello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for myself and not the hashtagBrandon so brilliantly came up with Iwould call it the walk back homemovement for myself because I was aRepublican from a very early age Ivolunteered on George HW Bush's primarycampaign in 1980 and then I registeredas a Republican when I turned 18 inChicago and I remained a Republicanuntil I moved to New York when I was 25years old and 1992 and people told mewhen I moved here if you want to berelevant you've got to be a Democrat inthis town and I thought well if I wanderstay irrelevant I would've stayed inChicago so I registered as a Democratand that year I voted for Bill Clintonmy first democratic president that Ivoted for and I remained a Democrat I'llbe it a Democrat who voted for a lot ofRepublicans I voted for Giuliani I votedfor Bloomberg I voted for GovernorPataki I pretty much mixed it up but Ivoted for all Democratic presidentsthrough Secretary Clinton and then onNovember 8th 2016 i sat there and I wasin shock I was in shock and I wasworried I had a lot of reasonduring the campaign I felt to be worriedabout Donald Trump I thought he wouldget us into nuclear war I thought hewould get us into a recession he is doneneither and I'm very pleasantly shockedand surprised by President Trump aspresident and his performance but thenight of November 8th 2016 I did notknow that I would be pleasantlysurprised I was devastated of that nightand I thought I just didn't understandhow it could happen and so I came homeand after President Trump gave hisacceptance speech I did find myselffeeling relieved because there had beena lot of speculation that the resultswould bedid that the election would go onforever I remember what 2000 was likewith bush and gore I did not want torelive that and so I was relieved atleast that the issue was settled it wasa very ugly campaign and I was glad itwas over and I was also in all honestygrateful to live in a country where atleast one person had voted for thepresident so I went on to Facebook about320 in the morning and I effectivelysaid you are my president presidentelect Trump congratulations in yourhard-won victory you have my prayers mysupport god bless americaI meant that I was truly grateful inthat moment to be in to live in ademocratic country and the blowbackpersonally to me kind of offline was wasnasty and it it kind of opened my eyesto the bigotry of the left and I starteddoing research I started reading Iwanted to make sense of why he wonbecause it didn't make sense to me thenight had happened and I talked to a lotof people ended up talking to very smartvery compassionate Trump voters and Iwas kind of reminded of why I had becomea Republican in the first placeit's because I value absolutely freedomof the individual overseas you knowsocial engineering frankly and I'm not abig fan of people sitting in the sentocentralization of power and remote powerI don't I'm not a fan of that never havebeen but I'm gay so when I became aDemocrat it felt natural do 92 and thenwhen gay marriage really when I wasyoung gay marriage was just like it waslike us all of us I mean people talkedabout two men getting married the sameway you would talk about a UFO landingit was the same level of probabilityso when gay marriage really became alegitimate issue when people startedtalking about marriage equality and whenyou know certain states likeMassachusetts and then there was talk ofHawaii at one point I was not going toleave the Democratic Party when theDemocratic Party was the only party eventhough Obama andwere against gay marriage in 2008 if youwere for gay marriage you had to be aDemocrat that's where it was happeningand that's ultimately who made it happenthere's talk that in New York State alot of Republicans just one of the issuegone and so they went to come on saidwell let's get this taken care of and Ibelieve that but let's keep givingcredit where credit is duemarriage equality was a democratic issueand the Democrats helped me to propel italong but that's one issue and there area lot of other issues that factor in intoday's world and after the election ofDonald Trump trying to make sense of theelection of Donald Trump I really gotback in touch with those issues andpeople explain things to me and I did alot of reading I did a lot of reading onmy own and seeing where country is goingthe role that immigration was playinghow people were using immigration and Icame to a lot of conclusions on my ownand it wasn't so much a rejection of aDemocratic Party although I did see alot of dysfunction there that I wasnever comfortable with but I believe inindividual liberty I believe that all ofus were just born with inherent rightsand we need to keep the government frominfringing on those rights governmentdoesn't give us rights were born withthat that's how I really truly believethat and I also believe in diversity ofthought one of the reasons I was drawnback to the Republican Party which Iregistered as a Republican just over ayear ago is that you don't know in theRepublican Party you have to ask someoneare you pro-choice do you pro-lifebecause they're both people there you'vegot to ask on all the issues there'strue diversity of thought and to methat's an incredibly interesting placeto be and it's the most natural place tobe there is no group thank theRepublican Party you do most likely youcan't assume that anyone's coming fromany one place and that's a great thatthat's a good place to be it's in twofor me so for me coming back to theRepublican Party after the election ofDonald Trump was certainly interesting alot of people like why nowbut seeing President Trump what he'sdone getting beyond the personality andthe Twitter and all that stuff and tothe actual results and the resolve thathas made a lot of sense to me and I'mvery proud to be a Republican I'm veryproud to be a trump supporter I did notthink I'd be saying that ever and onething I definitely didn't think I'd besaying in the age of Trump is that I'mrunning for office shortly after comingback to the Republican Party I wasrecruited by the Manhattan GOP to runfor state Senate and you're new here inManhattan in Trump's district district28 so I am the Republican candidate forNew York state Senate I'm also theReform Party candidate and we're on thestop de Blasio line and hopefully theindependence line and you know will makethings happen but this has been a veryinteresting time for me coming back tothe Republican Party walking away fromthe Democratic Party and getting to aplace where people can really tell thetruth the Republican Party is a big tentparty there are a lot of differentopinions and I love that and feel veryat home there I always did if I hadn'tbeen if I hadn't been gay I probablywould never have left the RepublicanParty to be honest and it doesn't throwmy death the Republicans were not opento gay people for a very long time itdoesn't thrill me but I don't judgepeople that what happened ten years agoI don't judge my boyfriends by what theydid ten years ago I'm not going to judgemy political party by what they did tenyears ago what's important now in anydecision whether it be a personalrelationship or a political party for meis what is happening now what ishappening today and I see the RepublicanParty being the party that's reallyprotecting the American peopleand the future of the American peopleand the freedom of the American peopleto say whatever the heck they want theparty of the first amendment is theRepublican Party in my opinion thesedays and freedom of speech is everythingto me it's the most important thing soI'm Pete Holmberg I'm a walk awaycandidateI'm the Republican candidate for NewYork State Senate in district 28 and Iam proud to have walked away and walkedhome to the Republican Party thank youhello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for

Trump is that I'mrunning for office shortly after comingback to the Republican Party I wasrecruited by the Manhattan GOP to runfor state Senate and you're new here inManhattan in Trump's district district28 so I am the Republican candidate forNew York state Senate I'm also theReform Party candidate and we're on thestop de Blasio line and hopefully theindependence line and you know will makethings happen but this has been a veryinteresting time for me coming back tothe Republican Party walking away fromthe Democratic Party and getting to aplace where people can really tell thetruth the Republican Party is a big tentparty there are a lot of differentopinions and I love that and feel veryat home there I always did if I hadn'tbeen if I hadn't been gay I probablywould never have left the RepublicanParty to be honest and it doesn't throwmy death the Republicans were not opento gay people for a very long time itdoesn't thrill me but I don't judgepeople that what happened ten years agoI don't judge my boyfriends by what theydid ten years ago I'm not going to judgemy political party by what they did tenyears ago what's important now in anydecision whether it be a personalrelationship or a political party for meis what is happening now what ishappening today and I see the RepublicanParty being the party that's reallyprotecting the American peopleand the future of the American peopleand the freedom of the American peopleto say whatever the heck they want theparty of the first amendment is theRepublican Party in my opinion thesedays and freedom of speech is everythingto me it's the most important thing soI'm Pete Holmberg I'm a walk awaycandidateI'm the Republican candidate for NewYork State Senate in district 28 and Iam proud to have walked away and walkedhome to the Republican Party thank youhello my name is Pete Holmberg and thisis my walk away video if I was to do ahashtag for myself and not the hashtagBrandon so brilliantly came up with Iwould call it the walk back homemovement for myself because I was aRepublican from a very early age Ivolunteered on George HW Bush's primarycampaign in 1980 and then I registeredas a Republican when I turned 18 inChicago and I remained a Republicanuntil I moved to New York when I was 25years old and 1992 and people told mewhen I moved here if you want to berelevant you've got to be a Democrat inthis town and I thought well if I wanderstay irrelevant I would've stayed inChicago so I registered as a Democratand that year I voted for Bill Clintonmy first democratic president that Ivoted for and I remained a Democrat I'llbe it a Democrat who voted for a lot ofRepublicans I voted for Giuliani I votedfor Bloomberg I voted for GovernorPataki I pretty much mixed it up but Ivoted for all Democratic presidentsthrough Secretary Clinton and then onNovember 8th 2016 i sat there and I wasin shock I was in shock and I wasworried I had a lot of reasonduring the campaign I felt to be worriedabout Donald Trump I thought he wouldget us into nuclear war I thought hewould get us into a recession he is doneneither and I'm very pleasantly shockedand surprised by President Trump aspresident and his performance but thenight of November 8th 2016 I did notknow that I would be pleasantlysurprised I was devastated of that nightand I thought I just didn't understandhow it could happen and so I came homeand after President Trump gave hisacceptance speech I did find myselffeeling relieved because there had beena lot of speculation that the resultswould bedid that the election would go onforever I remember what 2000 was likewith bush and gore I did not want torelive that and so I was relieved atleast that the issue was settled it wasa very ugly campaign and I was glad itwas over and I was also in all honestygrateful to live in a country where atleast one person had voted for thepresident so I went on to Facebook about320 in the morning and I effectivelysaid you are my president presidentelect Trump congratulations in yourhard-won victory you have my prayers mysupport god bless americaI meant that I was truly grateful inthat moment to be in to live in ademocratic country and the blowbackpersonally to me kind of offline was wasnasty and it it kind of opened my eyesto the bigotry of the left and I starteddoing research I started reading Iwanted to make sense of why he wonbecause it didn't make sense to me thenight had happened and I talked to a lotof people ended up talking to very smartvery compassionate Trump voters and Iwas kind of reminded of why I had becomea Republican in the first placeit's because I value absolutely freedomof the individual overseas you knowsocial engineering frankly and I'm not abig fan of people sitting in the sentocentralization of power and remote powerI don't I'm not a fan of that never havebeen but I'm gay so when I became aDemocrat it felt natural do 92 and thenwhen gay marriage really when I wasyoung gay marriage was just like it waslike us all of us I mean people talkedabout two men getting married the sameway you would talk about a UFO landingit was the same level of probabilityso when gay marriage really became alegitimate issue when people startedtalking about marriage equality and whenyou know certain states likeMassachusetts and then there was talk ofHawaii at one point I was not going toleave the Democratic Party when theDemocratic Party was the only party eventhough Obama andwere against gay marriage in 2008 if youwere for gay marriage you had to be aDemocrat that's where it was happeningand that's ultimately who made it happenthere's talk that in New York State alot of Republicans just one of the issuegone and so they went to come on saidwell let's get this taken care of and Ibelieve that but let's keep givingcredit where credit is duemarriage equality was a democratic issueand the Democrats helped me to propel italong but that's one issue and there area lot of other issues that factor in intoday's world and after the election ofDonald Trump trying to make sense of theelection of Donald Trump I really gotback in touch with those issues andpeople explain things to me and I did alot of reading I did a lot of reading onmy own and seeing where country is goingthe role that immigration was playinghow people were using immigration and Icame to a lot of conclusions on my ownand it wasn't so much a rejection of aDemocratic Party although I did see alot of dysfunction there that I wasnever comfortable with but I believe inindividual liberty I believe that all ofus were just born with inherent rightsand we need to keep the government frominfringing on those rights governmentdoesn't give us rights were born withthat that's how I really truly believethat and I also believe in diversity ofthought one of the reasons I was drawnback to the Republican Party which Iregistered as a Republican just over ayear ago is that you don't know in theRepublican Party you have to ask someoneare you pro-choice do you pro-lifebecause they're both people there you'vegot to ask on all the issues there'strue diversity of thought and to methat's an incredibly interesting placeto be and it's the most natural place tobe there is no group thank theRepublican Party you do most likely youcan't assume that anyone's coming fromany one place and that's a great thatthat's a good place to be it's in twofor me so for me coming back to theRepublican Party after the election ofDonald Trump was certainly interesting alot of people like why nowbut seeing President Trump what he'sdone getting beyond the personality andthe Twitter and all that stuff and tothe actual results and the resolve thathas made a lot of sense to me and I'mvery proud to be a Republican I'm veryproud

uhtoday i want to talk to you about how iescaped the leftand the crazy radical ideologiesum just a little bit of background aboutmyself i was never a political personum i voted for obama you know just likemostminorities did just because he was blackuh especially living in californialos angeles i mean most of us alwaysjust vote democrat we don't even thinkabout itum but it wasn't until this little covetlockdown situationuh that i really started getting more intune with the topics of what's going onuh in politics and just in general souh island small business the lockdownwas ridiculous to me i noticed thatcostcoand target and walmart all these otherplaces are lettingyou know people come in there with masksthousands and thousands of people everyday can walk through there plus all theemployees touching all these productsbut yet a small mom-and-pop business ormy small businessor hair salon you know doesn't have theopportunity to be openwhen we have one fifth or one-twentieththe amount of foot traffic sothat to me just set off all kind of redflags and i knew that something wasobviously wrongso uh that got meto start doing more research andactually start watching more newschannels and stuff like thatand as i was watching the news cnn msnbci just saw how much they just werebashing on trumpall i heard was this like cryingcomplainingjust talking all this nonsense abouttrump and just angry all the time youknow i didn't see any joyat all i didn't see any answers i justsaw complainingso i would flip back and forth betweencnn msnbcand granite i will always a democrat uhso as i start flipping back and forthbetween foxand cnn i'm saying well at least foxgives me a little bit more facts alittle bit more substancenot just all this uh ranting and emotionand

theroom my parent my mom was cryingtheir suitcases were packedi think at this time i meanwhat they were going through and iwalked in there and i asked my momi said what's going on where are yougoing and she put me on her lapand she said don't worry we're not goinganywhereeverything's okay and she sent me off tobedthe next day my parents were gone theyescaped now they couldn't tell anyonethey couldn't tell meobviously they couldn't tell anyonewhat was going on um my aunt who was20 years old at the time going through adivorce she was married at 15 she wasgoing through a divorce she wasemotionally unavailable to take care ofme and my cousinso she was there for me but i had myparents were gonethey left are when the government foundout that they had leftbecause it was so dangerous theycouldn't take me with themi mean they would have captured them andput them in political prison andforgotten about them foreverthere was just it was unheard of toescape during that time very few peopleescapedmy dad had a job at aship so he worked on ships where hetraveledto like africa and down themediterranean so hesaw different countries he sawhe saw a glimpse that most did notso that gave him the idea of how toescapebecause he came in with the mission toleave andmove to america one day he literallycame in with that mission he was asystem busterin the system the communist systemcouldn't keep himand so my mom had faith they had faitheven with no religion they had faithand they escaped and i remember duringthat timemy grandma was married to a westerner aczech slovakian man so she wasable to travel to the western worldwestern world she was able to travel toaustria and different places like thatand so she was able to comeand visit me but they wouldn't reallylet herany anymore once my parents escaped mygrandma couldn't come visit meand i remember government agentscoming and patting me on the head when iwas in daycare to make sure that the govthat my parents didn't find a way tosmuggle me that my grandma didn't comeand take me on the train and leave withme to austria like they kept herum they wouldn't let her leave bulgariauntil the government made sure i wasstill in daycarethat was one of the last times shevisited meum so they wouldn't let her leaveuntil they made sure that i was inschool and then they called the stationsaid okay she's okay to leaveso these kind of tactics they had ourphones tappedanytime my parents would call they foundout where my parents arethey would tell them that they're nevergonna see their daughter againthat they're traitors to the country imean just some of the worst thingsthat you can possibly say to someone umand and my parents went through a lotand and theythey escaped because they it was worthit for themthey wanted a better life for themselvesand eventually mei mean they didn't know if they weregoing to see me againmy grandma fought for me she moved toaustriaand was able to go to the the embassythere and theyfought for me my parents had no rightsthey wereimmigrants and refugeesbut my grandma had rights and she foughtwith me for meand eventually two years later they wereable tothey fought for me so much that thecommunist government was notallowed to hold me anymore they had togive me a passport and they waited untilmy parentspassport was about to expire so myparents they knewall the information they knew that myparents had to leave austria to go tocanadaand they waited until the day they leftfor canadato release me so i can beaway from my parents even longer severalmonthsmore like they they did those things onpurposemy grandma when she fought for me theytold her thatonly the communists will keep a childaway fromher parents and that's the way they doitum so finally they were able torelease me i was

all right people this is my hashtagwalkaway video and I have never beforebought into any of the hashtag movementbecause it seemed to me like any time ahashtag campaign was launched it wasbecause it was some entitled Millennialsstomping their feet because they didn'tget their way but I figured the hashtagwalkaway movement was something that wasa little different so here's my versionof my walkaway moment now I've beenraised in a credit because I came from apoor white working-class family all mylife I had been taught that it was ademocratic party that represented poorAmerica it was a represent DemocraticParty that represented black America itwas the Democrats that had secured equalrights for black Americans and it wasthe Democratic Party that maintainedthose rights to secure that they stillhad them for black Americans I had beenraised to believe that the DemocraticParty is the party event protected wasthe big brother of small business andthe Democratic Party it was was for theworking class and I had also been taughtto believe that it was those damned OhRepublicans that had been bought out byevery multimillion-dollar corporation inAmerica it was those damned OhRepublicans that sold out to Big Pharmaand let stuff on the shelves thatshouldn't be on there and Americans weretaking pills that they shouldn't betaken and everythingRepublicans were bad Democrats were goodand my walk away moment came andeverything that was running up to the2016 presidential election because priorto that I had never really been heavilyinvolved in politics and the reason wasbecause I was busy with my American lifeI had a full-time job kids law needed tobe mowed London needed to be donesomebody had a dentist appointment youknow all that stuff that comes withbeing American and although I wasn'theavily involved in politics by the timeBarack Obama left office I hadan absolute hatred for socialismliberalism and the progressive movementand those are words that I learned underthe Obama era because I never heardthose words before I wasn't familiarwith them and the reason I hated it sointensely the reason I hate grew to hatesocialism and liberalism so intently isbecause for eight years Barack Obamadictated to me through executive orderbecause he decided to abuse the powerthat he'd been given to write all theseexecutive orders to single-handedlytransform the United States of Americainto this utopia that he'd been taughtall the way back in college and I had tostand there by things like under theObama era it became politically correctfor anybody to identify as any genderthey want to and therefore had the rightto use the restroom that they wanted tonow I live in a flyover State and peoplerun here know that grown-ass men have nobusiness being in the same restroom aswomen and children or that teenage boyshave no business being in the samelocker room as teenage girls but in theObama era that was okay and Obamadictated to me things like you and youand you and you are gonna get a freecellphone and you're gonna help pay forit and then Obama and his administrationdecided that they the federal governmentneeded to sew up the healthcare industrybecause they could do far managed betterat managing it than these private sectorcapitalists and if your monthly premiumshealth insurance premiums jump from 600months to 900 a month sorry about yourluck and then I had to stand there I'mdoing the Obama era why this groupcalled black lives matter sprung up andI would stand there and watch in horrorfor multiple YouTube videos because Iquit relying on mainstream media butduring the presidential election andpeople that lived in these cities whereblack lives matter bro win and thesecities would be destroyed with riots andlooting and fires and busted glass andbus stops that have been torn tosmithereens andsmall businesses that have been takenout and by the time this group rolledout if they admitted they believe thelocal taxpayer footing the bill forseveral million dollars with the damageand the attitude was sorry about yourluck and then Barack Obama decides it'dbe a great idea to invite the leaders tothis group to the White House to givehim a special pat on the back anta boyyou know what I'm sayingand it's like but I didn't see if youwere here view reaching out to thesecommunities that they just destroyedunder Barack Obama era it becamepolitically furet correct for policeofficers just to have somebody walk upto him and sugar in the head kill himsube because they wore uniform and Icould go on and on and on but y'all aregetting the gist of this and so by thetime Barack Obama left office although Ididn't know much about politics I knewthat I absolutely hated socialismliberalism and the progressive movementso it was really curious to see what theUnited States of America was going toproduce in a way of candidates becausewe had by that point had become thisgreat divided you had the west coast andthe East Coast that were like-minded andthen you had middle America which wasI'm where I'm from and absolutelynothing in common with these coastalstates so we get Hillary Clinton and weget Donald Trump and Hillary Clintondecides to pick right up where BarackObama had left off it was like there wasnothing about middle America or middleAmerica values or medical American jobsthat was on her radar it's like oh thatwent over her head and I noticed thatevery time Hillary Clinton gave a speechher message was exactly the same whichwas all you female voters you'reoppressed and you just don't know itwhile you

sunglasses I suffer fromphoto media which is like sensitivity soI have to wear them and I just like theHat anyway I started in politics when Iwas about 15 years old when my cousinDavid took me to a Vietnam War protestshe was you know I was 15 and he was likeyou know you're gonna be 18 soon andthey're gonna want to draft you if thiswar doesn't end and I was like I don'twant to go kill people so I became ananti-war activist you know as much as a15 year old can do and you know but Iwas always a democratic alwaysconsidered myself a Democrat alwaysconsidered myself somewhat progressivebut I was never an ideologue I didn'thate the other side I didn't considerone perfect and one evil or any of thatcrap so I just you know okay I was aDemocrat but the Democrat Party he neverreally really really felt rightthere was something wrong with the wholepicture I saw the education system inNew York City and the and thesegregation and you know all this kindof stuff that just bothered me it's likeif the Democrat Party so great why arethe inner city so crap it didn't makeany sense to me so anyway I just wentalong with it because you know basicallyI was used to it that's what I knew butyou know it really wasn't like I said anideal I wasn't crazy about it but thencame 2016 and what I saw there was justso ridiculousI couldn't make heads or tails of it itjust seemed that the election of

good evening walk away Canada hi my nameis Stephen this is the first time thatI'll be posting within this group I'mgoing to talk a little bit about Who Iam and what brought me to this point ofjoining the walk away excuse me I feelthat my message needs to be heard andthe reason I do so is because I believethat the majority of us have been liedtowe have been lied to believe that theone side looks out for us more than theother and that's something that I fellfor for many many years of my adult lifeI'm going to tell you a little bit aboutmyself I am a matey Canadian which meansI'm half native and half European not ahappier peon is UkrainianI am also gay so that right there iswhat made me liberal I believe that theLiberalswere going to save me that they weregoing to ensure that my rights as a gaymale were taken care of and as aninterracial male I felt for overidentifying myself based on my race andmy sexuality and lost truth and lostwhat it really meant to be a Canadian sonow I identify myself as simply firstlast and foremost a Canadian I am NOT amatey Canadian I am NOT a gay CanadianI'm a Canadian and that's the thingsthat we need to be willing that's thatone thing that I feel we need to getback to is having some national pridejust simply being proud to be a Canadianbecause to me that's enough we have beenlied for sowe've been lied to for so many years andit was it's just assumed that if you areinto racial and that you are gay you areliberal and I was one of them I was afar lefted individual who was who wereprotesting against any conservativemovement motion anything then I realizedthat I was lied to as were many of uswell woke me up honestly with theAmerican election at the beginning of itI was a Trump hater and I was a Trudeausupporter I voted for adapt for Trudeauunfortunately but the more and more thatI watched Trump and really watched himand did my own research the more andmore I realized the Trump was not aracist a bigoted homophobic ortransphobic he was just simply anAmerican who was sick and tired ofAmericans being kicked around he wastired of seeing his people the Americanpeople being swallowed up by corruptionand that's what we are going throughright now here in Canada we are overidentifying ourselves with things thatin the big scheme of things do notmatter because being Canadian is atstake here the attack on our oilindustry the UN pact and you know whatyou'll learn that conservatives aren'tanti-immigration we are anti illegalimmigration that we are a land of lawsand those laws must be followed and if Ias a Canadian born citizen sorry my noseis itchy and I'm expected to followthose laws than anyone enterour borders or attempting to come intothis country need to do it legally Imyself have been labeled a racisthomophobe which is kind of funny becauseas I've explained to you earlier on inthe videoI am interracial I'm ma T and I'm alsogay so I want that to really sink intoyou when they can live label me a racisthomophobe then realistically no one isoff-limits the labels when someonedisagrees with somebody is anotherreason that I started opening my eyeswatching comments that people wouldcomment on someone who's got more of aconservative viewpoint the type ofcomments that they would leave theinsults the put-downs the threats andthe same great type of racist remarksthat they're coming down onconservatives supposedly for being Iseen more racist comments being postedby left minded liberals than I do byconservatives and I am now proud toannounce that I am a conservative andthat I will make sure and ensure thatour values as Canadians are taken careof across the board my rights as aninterracial gay man do not Trump anyoneelses rights when my rights as anindividual start hindering the rights ofmy fellow Canadians that's when it'sbecoming a problem and what's happeningis we're silencing people and that isnot right we live in a land that issupposed to be free where we prideourselves in freedom of speech sosomeone this simply disagrees withsomething they're entitled to do sowithout worrying about ridiculeput-downs insults threats and yeslabeling this is my Canada as it isyours and it is not only my obligationbut my honor to take a stand for mynation and for all that call it home andthat all who will respect the valuesthat is Canada I came across the walkaway movement because of a few friendsand you know I honestly feel like I wasidentifying as a liberal even though Istill had part of me that didn'tcompletely believe in the in the Liberalsystem in a way because I've alwaysquestioned things but I simply used togo with the grain I used to follow thepact I used to pride myself on thinkingI was a leader when I was a follower butnow I am a lion and you will hear meroar I will no longer stay silent and Iwant no one else to feel they must besilenced because they will be labeledand if they someone does label you letthem I have learned to just acceptthough not everyone is going to agreewith what I have to say and I'm okaywith respectful debate but you can'texpect anyone to listen to you or yourargument when you start insulting andputting them down we are naturallydefensive beings so as soon as someonestarts putting us down insulting us ourwalls of defense go up then there's noway the person you're talking to is evengoing to listen to you we tend to leantoo much on our emotions and less withlogic and that's one thing that kept melost for so long is because I overidentified with my sexuality in my raceI felt like any time I would see a storyor an article on mainstream media or inthe papers and they would make sure thatthey pointed out that the person was gayor interracial or First Nations orwhatever but it angered me they preyedon our emotions and I realize that nowthey preyed on us and they preyed on ourvulnerabilities while I will no longerthan do that I am going to awaken moreCanadians as time goes by this isn't theend of me and nor is my voice ever goingto be silenced the same people anotherthing is another reason I was pushedaway from conservatives was because Iwas told that they would not accept me Iwas made to believe that they werehomophobic racist and bigoted and I'vedone a few videos in in other groups asyou will full of people from all walksof life have a video out there that'sgarnered over 20,000 views mainly ofwhich was viewed by conservative mindedpeople or conservatives and you knowwhat not one comment about my homelessabstract homosexuality and not onecomment about my race all the commentsthere were encouraging uplifting andinspiring these were the same type ofpeople that I was taught to fear that Iwas taught would never accept me and ifI was able to I would show you the manythe dozens upon dozens of inboxes fromconservative Canadians that reached outto me for thanking me for speaking upthanking my bravery telling me that theyaccept me for who I amwhich is Stephen being Stephen is enoughbeing Canadian is enough and anotherthing that liberal minded people pushare the Liberal government's push isthis victim mentality that we are allvictims that I'm a victim because I'mgay because I'm a victim because I'm 80or that I have First Nation ancestry butI'm not a victim I'm not and neitherneither or any of you you can choose tobe a warrior or you can choose to be avictim you can choose to be a leader orI can choose to be a victimwell I don't want to be a victim I amNOT a victim and I won't let anygovernment institution make me feel thatI must be a victim simply because of mysexuality or my race religion or genderwe are be we've gotten so lost andthings that in the big scheme of thingsdo not matter our nation is crumblingour economy has come to a halt we mustrise up Canada come together it realizedthat we were told a big fat lie aboutconservatives and about how we shouldfeel about conservatives or people withconservative values or morals orwhatever and realize that it's time toput the control back in the hands of thepeople us Canadians and hold ourinstitutions the people governing usthat they work for us and not the otherway aroundI love my Canada and I will never stopstanding on guard for thee most of myvideos I end by singing the nationalanthem and I'ma hope you'll you're okaywith that and I sing it the way I wastaught not the reworded one but the oneI was taught so here I go Oh Canada ourhome and native land true patriot lovehe know Larsoncommand with glowing hearts we see theerise the True North strong and free fromfar and wide o Canada we

my name is Terry and the reason I walkedaway from Democratic Party back in the90s I voted for Bill Clinton and wemarched on Washington with a quilt wetried to get money for AIDS charitiesand for AIDS research and they shot usdown actually they didn't give us any ofthe money that we needed we started theAtlanta AIDS Walk we did everything thatwe could to get up money and thenHillary Clinton went on TV and said thatmarriage was between a man and a womanhomosexuality was you know a sin soreally left a bad taste in my mouthand that's when I left that party and itwas really funny because you know shewaited 20 years later and then tried tomanipulate my children and yes I havethree children and she tried tomanipulate them into voting for hersaying that she cared about my rightswhen so many of my brothers died of AIDSwaiting for help that they didn't getfrom a party that promised they caredabout us and didn't and didn't give usanything so that's when I left the partyand I find it really funny because ofanybody with a brain does any backgroundcheck they'll see that president Trumpdonated a lot of money to AIDS charityand he helped us in many waysand that's something that they're nottelling in the community that'ssomething that none of my brothers aregetting to hear about but they're alllike they get into a frenzy and theywant to argue with you know like standup to your face and tell you you're anidiot and you're against your own whenthey don't even know the history youknow a lot of these younger ones didn'teven live through it they haven't seenwhat we saw and then there's the olderones thatthink just don't remember or don't wantto rememberyou know they buried it with all of ourdead brothers the three generations ofgay males that died waiting for you knowsomeone to do something for them andthat's when I lost any luster that I hadfor the Democratic community and theirparty and for years I've been trying towake up my brothers and my sisters andnow look what they're doing to what webuilt what we fought to get rights forthey're now bastardizing they'rebringing in all these like anything theycan things that back in the day we saidwould never happen you know we just wantthe same rights as everybody else andnow all of a sudden they're bastardizingwhat we fought for so hard to makehappen and I don't think that people arereally opening their eyes and seeingthat and I pray that my brothers andsisters open their eyes and see thesepeople for what they really are they aretotally for the fall of America and lookat the people that they're putting inwith like our equal rights and and ourmarches and and you know are thesepeople if you look at their backgroundsthey have nothing to do they with whatyou and I are really fighting for itwhat none of us as Americans want asAmericans we all want to love each otherblack white green yellow orange purplewhatever the hell we are we all want torespect each other we all want to helpeach other prosper we we go out of ourway to helpother countries but yet we're nothelping ourselves anymoresomething has to change and I reallythink Trump is that change so andanything that I've said you can go andcheck you can find out its historypeople can't change history the thearticles are there the videos are thereeverything's there look up what Hillarysaid look up when Trump gave us eightmillion dollars so these things you canfind them they're very easy to locateknow your enemyand unfortunately these days our enemyis the Democratic Party they're theenemy of everyone gay straight blackwhite everybody because they want tosegregate us if they separate us make ushate each other they can pick us offeasier but if we all come together theycan't do that that's what they're tryingto do divide separate conquer and Ibabbled on but I just thought I'd get mypoint across and I've lost a lot offriends by saying what I've said to youin my community a lot of people I've hadheated discussions with them and it'svery hard to get someone has thatliberal mindset to hear a fact or evengo look it up and back in my day we wewere liberals with facts you know we weknew what we were doing and these peoplethey're not what we were and I'm gladyou guys are waking up and God bless youand I hope you bring more people to thetruthtake care[Music]
hi my name is Lisa I am a former 45 yearregistered Democrat who has decided towalk away I guess I started having thisrevelation about what was going on withmy party back during the debate timewhen we were trying to pick a candidateto run against the Republican candidateand the DNC decided to force HillaryClinton down our throats whether wewanted her or not and even went to thepoint of cheating I find the party leftme I didn't leave them it's become aparty of extreme left-wing extremistswho are just filled with hate and angerdisrespect lack of compassion lack oftolerance and that's not what theDemocratic Party has represented to mefor the last 45 years I joined the partyright at the tail end of the Vietnam Warit called to me it was to be aninclusive party that was going torepresent all people of all color of allsexuality and it was the party of loveand compassion and tolerance and respectfor the freedom of speech and thosethose things are gone now now it's justname-calling tagging people thatdisagree with you a Nazi you know justsome kind of a bigot a racist just ahorrible name that has been used so manytimes now it doesn't even have an effecton people anymore and it's just identitypolitics and it's pretty disgusting I'membarrassedat the direction of my party's gone itis certainly leaning more towards aSocialist Party now and none of myrepresentatives have done anything totry to stop it and so they no longershare the values that I have and I willbe taking my vote elsewhere I have movedmore into the dependent and we'll bevoting for who I want and I will nothave a party dictating to me and forcinga candidate themthroughout I could never in goodconscience vote for Hillary Clinton andI am not a Russian I've never been toRussia I don't speak Russian I'mcertainly not a robot to the best of myability and I am just absolutelydisgusted that mainstream media istrying to do its best to discredit thismovement the movement now has a hundredand ten thousand people in it that arepretty much like methey're sick of the nasty politics andthey just want to to be more moderateand so they've chosen to walk away anduntil the Democratic Party can dosomething to stop there their votersfrom the kind of behavior that's goingon I think it's gonna continue to tolose members and it's unfortunatebecause I always believe that theDemocratic Party was the pollak party oftolerance and it certainly isn't thankyou

grateful for this groupum i grew up in a family i'm in oregonthat um politics weren't a thing when iwas growing upwe went to church uh my parentsum taught sunday school and all thethings and thenum when i was in fifth grade they got adivorceand things just kind of unraveled and umi ended up being the only one going tochurch after that so um i credit a lotofmy life and my my health whether it bespirituallyemotionally all of it to my faith umbecause you know my family is verydysfunctional as arelike many um but as i got olderi definitely um definitelyencountered a lot of i would call itbullyingfrom my family my dad and my sister inparticular for my faithum and i have always beenkind of um people pleaser andtried to keep the peace in my family andjust never spoke up and then as ium went through college i also will haveto say my mom came from aconservative family my dad came from theliberal family and i didn't reallypay attention to that until i got olderumbut um anyway i went throughcollege i have a master's degree and ialways really took pride in notbeing extreme on one end or the otherand just likebeing kind of moderate and seeing thingsfrom both sides i took pride in thatum but as i got even older my dad becamemore extremein his um liberal perspective andyou know very angry i've seena lot of anger from my dad and my sisterand i'm a twin actuallyand um my sister umis a lesbian and you know umi'm 43 trying to think of when shecame out it's probably been like maybe10 years um and ilove everybody i take pride in that ireally do ihave never ever ever ever said a meanthing i don't even feel it you know whywould i say itand um yet i've beeni have been umlabeled and judged for howshe thinks that i believe and then mydad as well in terms of my faithand political beliefs even when he waswrongactually because i haven't always votedrepublican i haven'tand one year when before i have a 14year old before he was bornum so 2004um election time and i wasrenting a room out of my dad's house andum came home and you know my dad umhas a drinking problem and pretty surehe wasum a little bit drunk and high andum he had been on his computer back inthe dial-up daysand was raging madand followed me around the houseveins popping out red in the facetossed me up against the wall and wasthis close to me like spitting in myfaceabout the election and me votingrepublican

hello YouTube this is fly over kami andwelcome to my new channel I wasn't quitesure what video I wanted to have myfirst video be and since the walk awaycampaign is so explosive right now Ithought I would tell my story aboutwalking away so here we go I think thatprobably during Bush juniors years andtrying to get his attention for issuesthat were personally impacting my lifethat that was probably the beginning ofmy eyes opening because no matter what Idid no matter how many letters I wroteto then George Bush jr. it didn't matterI never got a responsenot even a form letter to at leastacknowledge that I had concerns that Ifelt needed to be addressed on behalf ofmyself and millions of Americans so Ikind of disheartened went on to theDemocrat Party and sadly I don't think Ireally knew what the Democrats or theRepublicans were all about I do recallhearing many times that Republicans arefor the rich people and Democrats arefor the people that aren't rich andsince I wasn't a rich person I must be aDemocrat and I'm not really good atfollowing the crowd so I think maybepart of me always spot against being oneparty or the otherI just wanted whoever was in charge tolisten to what I had to say because Iwas gonna vote for somebody and whoeverI was going to vote for needed to besupportive ofthe causes that were important to me andsadly it didn't happen with the DemocratParty or the Republican Party nobodylistened the establishment does notlisten to the little people becausewe're not the establishment it's alldisgusting so I had gone to once I movedon from the Republican Party back in theGeorge Bush jr. days I went on to theDemocrats and I tried to get theattention of John Kerry the attention ofJohn Edwards when they are running forpresident and both of them gave me thesame line when I asked my question tothem in their rallies are their visitsto my community and their answer waswe'll look into it and of course theynever looked into it nobody ever looksinto anything unless you give them lotsof money and it doesn't impact who'scontributing dollars to their campaignso I was pissed off about those two andthen Obama comes along so I wrote Obamamultiple letters never heard anythingand so I did I only voted for Obama onceso the second time around I had a realbig wake-up call or red pill moment orwhatever you'd call it when I was inline at the store because the ladiesbehind me we're talking about who theywere voting for in 2012 and you'll neverguess why they were voting for Obamathey said they were voting for Obamabecause his wife was beautiful are youkidding me does it dumbest thing I everheardwe're voting for the person that's goingto leave the country because their wifeis beautiful I I was dumbfounded so Iwent home and thoughtokay this can't be why people vote forthe president and then I thought tomyself I have no idea why I'm evenvoting for who I'm voting for so I hadto pay attention so I didn't vote forObama I thought maybe I could get theattention of John McCain nope no chancethe only person that I felt at thatpoint that paid any attention to thelittle people with Sarah Palin and theydestroyed her on Saturday Night Live Godand I I think that was when I kind ofstopped watching television I wouldoccasionally watch some programs but Inever watched Saturday Night Live againafter the horrible way they treatedSarah Palin and of course now my god ifthey didn't have President Trump toharass on Saturday Night Live theywouldn't have a show in fact I don'tthink CNN would be alive today or MSNBCor half of the other fake news mediabecause if they didn't have Trump - -they wouldn't have a network should becalled the Trump bashing Network and I'mglad everybody's turning it off Istopped watching the news a long timeago and I stopped watching the newsbecause I was sick of the commercialsdrug commercial galore that's all it isit's like the drug news network you haveto have I don't even think anybody elseI'm sponsors the news every commercialis a drug commercial and I am NOT a fanof the pharmaceutical industry butthat's a really long video we'll getinto another time so when PresidentTrump came down that escalator I thoughtyou know what maybe he's different and Ilistened to what he had to say and heactually talked about some of the thingsthat were important to me so I kind ofstarted to pay attention to him and whenhe came to my town for a rally I got ahold of his campaign staff in my stateand said I really need to get up closeto him because I have to give him aletter it's so important so the peoplefrom his campaign got back in touch withmethey had me meet them at the rally herein my area and they let me in with themand then into the front row so Iactually had a chance to spend like Idon't know it seemed like a really longtime to me but it was probably only liketwo minutes that mr. Trump stoppedI gave him my letter and I gotta ask hima couple questions and instead of a yesand no answer that you would probablyexpect for most people he actually gaveme some answers and then asked mequestions so he kind of had aback-and-forth for a couple minutes thatI don't gather he would remember afterall of the people that he's met acrossthe country but I will never forget itbecause it was the first time in 18years that anybody and the politicalsphere has paid a damn bit of attentionto what I had to say and I was just Ican't even explain how excited I was Ithink I cried the whole time I had myBrittany moment the whole way homebecause I was so shocked that of all thepeople and all the places in all of thecommotion that he had time to talk to meand listen and that's a pretty amazingfeeling to know that while our nowpresident had a moment for me and paidattention to what I had to say so um Idon't think I'm a Republican I don'tthink I'm a Democrat I know I'm not aDemocrat for crying out loudbut I think we're a three-party systemin this country now we have the Looneytune liberals we have the dim or theRepublicans and there's a handful ofgood ones but thenwe have the party of Trump and that iswhere I am so I vote for him in 2020 Ilove our president and I love how he ismaking America great again he's reallygiving the power back to the people andit's such a shame that there's so manypeople in this country that don't knowit yet everything that he's doing isn'tjust for part of the population is forall of us this is America first andthat's not a crime and the stupid fakenews that thinks that America first is acrime those people are nuts it is not acrime to be America first and for theAmerican people when you're thepresident it's not a crime to want yourcountry to succeed or to be great andsafe and successful that's smart butthen again the fake news isn't smarttheir job is to destroy the presidentand I don't know what the hell else theydo but I guess it's really kind of funnyif you do happen across them on YouTubeit's kind of embarrassing I'membarrassed for all of them they'remaking such fools of themselves and I'meven more embarrassed for the peoplethat haven't woke up yet that actuallysit there and believe everything thatCNN and MSNBC says like it's gospel it'sridiculous it is definitely fake newsbut it has been fake news for a verylong time far before the 2016 electionthe 2016 election just kind of made itworse and now they have somebody tocharge it and they have something totalk about even if it's so thatis my walkaway story I walked away along time ago for a long time I justkind of walked around the circlebecause they didn't exactly know where Ibelong but I know that I belong with ourpresidentand I'm so glad so many people arewalking away and we're all comingtogether as Americans and standing upfor what's right and standing up for ourpresident and standing up for the truthso I look forward to talking toeverybody again and thank you so muchfor watching
my name is AJ I use he him they thempronouns and I made a video last year orso I think for this group and I was justreally nervous and not very confident atthe time I had a lot of anxiety so itwas very short and and I just wanted tomake a longer one that I was morecomfortable with and more confident withso I know last year the admins hadwanted to use the video for somethingand I didn't want them to so this thistime it's it's okay so you guys can usethis however you however you need to butanyway I just wanted to give a littlebit of information about myself and tellyou a little bit about my backgroundhopefully I won't make this too long soI am a member of the LGBTQ community Iidentify as non-binary and demisexualpanromantic all that stuff if you haveany questions about what any of thatmeans you can comment or private messageme that's fine I I grew up in a housethat was democratic until I became ateenager and then they kind of went likemy my parents went the other way toointo far right and I also went far rightand now I'm more independent um forinstance I support the LGBTQ communitybut I'm also pro-life I am very muchanti-abortion I want to secure ourborders I want a flat tax II support the Trump administration inmost of what they do and I I think thatthe states should be able to make a lotmore decisionsthey are currently making I think that alot of things that the federalgovernment currently controls should behandled by the state side really heavilybelieve in the 1st and the 10thamendments of course all of theamendments but I'm often advocating forthose as well as the Second Amendment Iam a legal gun owner I am going pheasanthunting for the first time this Decemberbut I find that I am just an independentand my beliefs and my values kind of aremore on the conservative side but Itreat every individual issue and lookand every individual issue separatelyfrom the collective I guess I don'tlisten to the news anymore I have ananxiety disorder not it's just I get mynews from family and friends and then Igo and research what they've said to meor I get it from this group or my otherconservative groups and that's goodenough for me because the MSM is justnot not doing justice to actual news somy point in introducing myself is to saythat I am not the typical Trumpsupporter I ambiologically female I identify on youknow the non-binary scale I am part ofthe LGBTQ community and by every rule Iguess imposed on me by society I shouldnot be a fan of President Trump and I amand I'm really proud of Mike Pence and Iam in Indiana I think that he was a verygood governor our our state did veryvery well under him and I think he'sbeen a very good vice president I'msuper proud of him and I like thetrumpetstation and I'm I should be a Democratby every stretch of the imagination andI'm not because I read I'm sorry thatwas a little salty um no but I I look ateach individual issue and I I divedeeply into it I don't just trustheadlines I don't just trust what peoplesay I don't listen to hearsay I look forthe truth and the truth has led me towalk away from liberalism and and theDemocratic Party maybe if it was thesame Democratic Party that it was backin the eighties or somethingI would be more inclined to be part ofit but as it stands right now so that'smy story and if the admins or somethingwants to use this in whatever projectthey can if you have any questions aboutanything that I believe or stand for oridentify as or whatever um you guys cancomment or private message me that lasttime I made one of these posts I got somany comments and messages that myFacebook app crashed multiple times in aday so I I just really like to have thatdialogue going though and I know that alot of people have a lot of questionswhen they realize that I am what shouldbe stereotypically Democratic and I'mnot I'm also a Christian I used to be awitch when I was teenager ish and nowI'm a Christian and I still identify astrans non-binary and all that stuff andand a lot of people sometimes havequestions about that too so if you haveany questions if you want to know anyinformation just let me know just pleasebe respectful and I'll be respectfulback so I think that our world hasforgotten how to be compassionate andthink that compassion is somethingthat's desperately needed nowadays so Ido my best it's not in my nature um butI do my best to answer with compassionand the truth and try to word myopinions to the best of my ability sothat other people can understand mythought process so yeah just let me knowthanks for listening and I'm I've been apart of the walk away group since Julyof last year I think something like thatit's been a while and I love seeing allyour stories so thanks so much forlistening to me and catch on the footsideyou

believed you have to lookat each candidate to decide who it isyou want to vote for and they alwaysvoted a straight Democratic line which Idid too for a while until I decided Icouldn't follow some of the Democraticbeliefs because of the fact that I'm aChristian and I'll just put it out therethe one that took me away was the factthat I am pro-life and the Democrats arenot that was the straw that

the Democratic Partybecause I'm also I was born and raisedCatholic my folks are heavy-dutyDemocrats they believed you have to lookat each candidate to decide who it isyou want to vote for and they alwaysvoted a straight Democratic line which Idid too for a while until I decided Icouldn't follow some of the Democraticbeliefs because of the fact that I'm aChristian and I'll just put it out therethe one that took me away was the factthat I am pro-life and the Democrats arenot that was the straw that broke thecamel's back way back when then whenBill Clinton was elected as president Ihad a friend who had been elected toCongress great manhe went to school Oh a few years aheadof me he was a lawyer and I worked hiscampaign even though he was a Democratand I was not anymore I really believedin the man he won he went to DC and hewas there for two years when he cameback home on their first leave he madeit known to all of us that as soon ashis term was up he was done and I askedhim I said Jim why and he's doneWashington DC is unlike any place hesaid you go in you're immediately toldwhat you can and can't do how are youwere going to vote who you're going totalk to you and then you have peoplecome in who talk to you for five minutesand leave basically a pile of money onyour desk and say just make sure you getthis debt okay and he said I called manyof them and told them no you're I don'ttake bribes take the money and go and hesaid I went to votes and I went toparties and I did things with everybodyelse and quickly found out that dice youwere living back home and in a modestforty fifty sixty thousand dollar housewe're now selling their houses andbuying a million dollar houses on theother side of the county and not evensticking with their constituents whovoted him in because there's so muchmoney from so many different places andhe said if I say there I'll lose my soulthe founding fathers told us if we wentto a two-party system the country wouldnot last they warned us and you can readthis it's it's in their own hands butthey they told us that the parties willbecome corrupt the money will be toomuch the power will be too much it won'tbe the will of the people it will be thewill of the party and we're seeing thatwith the Democrats and the new socialistagenda Maxine Waters calling out all ofher supporters to don't let them go in Pplace in public harass them tear themdown don't let them go hey we got thesame thing on the Republican Partynothing the same extent right now but wedid I remember the things that came outabout Hillary and about

not telling you the truthyou
this is my walkaway video I think it'sbest I give you a little bit ofbackground about how I was brought upand raised I was born in 1977 and southsuburban Chicago Cook County and Iwasn't really born to a political familyat least that I can remember I was bornand raised I can't say born I was raisedin a Southern Baptist Church and CountyMississippi Illinois and I went tochurch every Sunday with my family andin 1983 my dad had lost his job or gotlaid off at Republic Steel and he joinedthe military US Army at 31 years old hewas about five years old five or six andso he left you know and pretty much fromthat point on I didn't have a father inmy house so let me tell you fromexperience I believe truly believewholeheartedly that that was my downfallas a kid you know and the direction mylife was gonna go for the next 20 22years was obviously because of mychoices but I didn't have a man in thehouse to really beat my assyou know figuratively speaking literallywhatever rightso I ran all over my mom I did I was arebel and I was counting down the daysuntil I turned 16 just so I could dropout of high school I absolutely hatedschoolI I didn't really hate to learn it'sjust I hate it schoolso I'd say within three years of medropping out of high school I was in Ilanded myself in prison I was a drugdeal that went bad I got shot threetimes I shot that guy twice and I got a9 year prison sentence I'm not blaminganybody but me because I actually knowwhat personal responsibility is so itwas all my fault it was my doing butpart I played in it and I played majorroles in my life I'm the creator of mylife I like to think anyway soeverything that's ever happened to megood or bad I had to say that I played apart in it you know it was either my baddecision my poor decision-making ormaybe I made some good decisions youknow along the way so from there and bythe way I've always been a drug addict Imean of course not in the past 12 yearsbut the majority of my life I've been adrug addict from smoking weed the firsttime in 11 or 12 years old shootingheroin shooting methamphetamines smokingcrack doing lines of cocaine whateveryou name it I pretty much did it and sowhen I got out of prison I decided totry heroin for the first time I don'tknow why I decided that probably becauseI'm an addict mentally in the head and Ihave an addictive personality orwhatever right so I'll tell you what Idid here one for six months when I gotout of prison and in that six months Ilost every piece of anything that I everhadproperty material things self-worthself-esteem everything rightso I ran man I ran from an addictionthat at the time I had no idea rightthat no matter where I went I alwaystook meet with me so I can run anywhereand everywhere possible but I can'toutrun myself well that's all I did Ijumped on the Greyhound in 2005 Januaryand took it to Southern California Iwent out I went out there to sellmagazines door-to-door write travel thecountry that's all the end the paper Icalled it and they they paid for my busticket down there and I was now all of asudden I was in the magazine crew thatlasted like a few days I couldn't knockon doors like that I didn't feel rightabout knocking on doors I didn't feelright about lying to people's faces andtelling them this big spiel about justwhatever just sticking by some [ __ ]magazines from okay so I quit but then Iwas in a situation because I quit I wasstuck in California and I'm fromIllinois I didn't know anybody out thereand I had no money so you can imaginewhy I have a dentist right well Ithought myself hopeless and I was inAnaheim the city of Orange Santaon the Santa Ana River bed and it was ahomeless community on there still is ahomeless community out thereits massive actually on that river bedit was pretty big when I was out theretoo but when I went back out there in2016 and it's it's just it's massive nowthere's so many more homeless people outthere and there's so many so anyways Istayed on that River been homeless forabout a year and a half two years andwhat got me to change my life aroundwhat got me to get clean and cleanmyself up was guilt and no not whiteguilt uh I had two kids out there I hada boy and a girland this was in 2006 and both of theirmothers were homeless women as well andI just could not take the guilt mydaughterdefinitely she was born first and thenseven days later my son was born but theway my son was born he was born at 20weeks gestation he was 1 pound 10 ouncespositive for methamphetamines and Iplayed a role in that I played a majorrole in that I couldn't take it it wasat that moment that I realized that Iwas the most selfish self-centered manor sorry excuse for a man that I've everknown you know it was a day of reckoningfor meI couldn't take it man I could not takethe guilt just couldn't getting explainthe amount of guilt how heavy it wasright now I can't explain it with wordwith mere words so I came back home andcleaned myself up you know and sincethen in 2007 I I landed a pretty goodjob you know I'm in the Union now andthis and that so uh so why I'm walkingaway I said well I'm walking away rightI'm in the Union and the first time Igot a letter from the Union suggestingon who I vote for I was happy you know Iwas just happy to be a part of societyand in my head I haven't lived insociety at least any kind of aproductive member of society I haven'tso I was just happy to do it for himyou know they negotiate my wages theygive me the health insurance I'm gonnavote for who you want me to vote noproblem right and I did I voted forBarack Obama without knowing a thingabout them I was black and I wanted thatactually I wanted the direction of ourcountry to go that way you know and Ididn't really check anything else aboutthemI just that's what I wanted so andthat's what I got the man ran on aplatform of change and we got that so Ican't complain about that so the reasonI'm walking away and I this time I'mwalking away from the Democrat Party whoknows a four year or six years 20 22yearsain't no way year is right so in twoyears I might vote for or I willprobably vote for Tom in 2020 and afterthat I don't know who all before I don'teven know the state of our country bythat who really knows because it'sgetting crazy guys it's getting realcrazy it's been crazy it's just now allon the surface now it's been like that Ican promise you that and I know for afact it's been like that it's just allbeen subtle and underneath you know andbut my head is crazy this is not theUnited States that I grew up in this isnot the United States and I want mychildren to grow up in and that's thereason I will never blow the boat blueagain I got kids man I've got I've gotnot just the two I've got three otherkidsand currently my kids range in age from3 to 12 and I care about them so Ireally don't care who the Union tells meto vote for I don't care who's whosehands and whose pockets I'm doing it formy kids I'm doing it for my familybecause it starts at my house with mykids but let me tell you a little bit alittle story though my daughter that wasborn in 2006 in California Orange CountyI ended up getting getting custody ofher last year in December of 2017 I'llnever forget when she first came I'vebeen like from let me just say this I'veliked home for a while I didn't reallyknow too much about him but I just knowyou know I liked him I mean he is likethe American dream and I don't reallycare if he started off borrowing like amillion dollars from his dad the man hasbillions right now of his own moneyyou know I know for a fact I can't dothat and if any of you guys can do itmore power to you right so anyway mydaughter I got custody of her lastDecember she's been with me about 11months now and when she came in I thinkTrump was on the news or something likethat and she goes like this goes I hateTrump and then she was all for Hillaryright and so I'm like why why do youmean Trump who told you thatlike why exactly do you hate him and whyexactly do you hate Hillary well thetime she was 11 and I really didn'texpect her to know an answer butnonetheless I'm doing this to prove apoint or right so fast forward to lastSaturday a week ago yeah week ago todayTrump was in Murfreesboro Illinois Ididn't give my daughter a choice I tookher well I took her in my family and Itook her for a reason and she was intoit you know she was clapping like ohyeah and so after the rally I asked herI said what do you think what do youthinkoh all that was good it was good I saidokay did you hear anything racist bychance coming out of his mouth no that'swhat she said right my eye well thatshould tell you something right don'tbelieve everything you hearnow I don't really care who my daughtervotes for when she gets of age you knowas long as she makes her own decisionsthat's it as long as she hears thingswith her own ears and makes her owndecisions and not based on whateverybody's saying right because that'sthe problem with this country with a lotof people in this country and it mayhave been my problem - it may be myproblem I really don't know sometimesit's hard to see when you're on theinside I'm just I'm upset you know I Idon't want our country to go the wayit's going I certainly do not wantglobalism at all I don't want openborders and I'm not sure if these guysthink that they're more enlightened thanus the the mere peasants we are hope Ireally don't know but I'm not ready toget my country up like that I am NOTready to give my country go so go fightfor I mean there's more than one way tofight right you fight with your mouthyou can fight physically a lot of peopleare fighting on the internet whateverbut I will fight for my country and Iwill fight for what I believe is rightI'll fight for my kids fight for myfriends I'll fight for my familyI'll fight for the truth I'll fight forwhat's right open borders is it right inmy head from my point of view openborders is not right okay we got enoughcriminals over here and trust me I donot believe that that whole Caravan isall criminals I don't believe that but Idon't believe they're all women andchildren either I don't believe they'reall just people looking for work see Igot common sense man I know these peoplegot common sense too so I don't evenknow why they're trying to lie to peoplethey're trying to lie to us knowing thatwe know they're lying and I don't get itI don't get it who knows manbut I I know this for a fact and I knowthis from dealing with people in thepast my own experience there thesepeople are on a code of silence man theywill not come clean period I promise youthey won't they won't talk about [ __ ]they won't talk about it I know theywon't code of silence man I don't knowif you guys get that butI mean what we consider colder silencetrust me what they got going is a codeof silence they won't talk about [ __ ]they won't you might get one peep out ofsomebody but they're gonna pay for soanyways that's my walkaway story I meanit's not really a walkaway story I guessit's more about personal responsibilityit's about whatever all I know is thiscountry's messed up and I am voting allred oh this midterm for one reason andone reason only it's not for the GOPit's not for the Republicans I do thinkI have conservative values and let metell you one other thing about that tooright because the the side of the leftfor me they do have a persuasiveargument I mean they do pull itheartstrings right I mean I watch CNNsometimes not because I you knowwhatever I want to hear what they'retalking about I'm tired of hearing soundbites right I need to know what they'retalking about and they do pull up myfreaking heartstrings man of course manI want to help people I do want to helppeople that they're in pain or having arough time I think it's in my nature forthem for the most part and so when I'mconfused when the waters are muddy Ialways go back to one thing man I goback to principles principles will guideme the right direction when I'm confusedabout things or where my heart stringsare being pulled I'm against abortionthere's one principle I'm pro-lifeand just because and I've been involvedin two abortions in my younger years andhave since repented I stand firm onpro-life now and it's not just because Ihad a vasectomy right I extended fairamount of pro-life what do you want meto do I got five kids come on I'm tooold to be having kids oh so it's allabout the principles right when thewaters get muddy go back to your frickinprinciples are you pro-life yeah who'spro-choice the left real simple to mereal simple so anyways that's mywalkaway story I'm probably it probablyends up being just rambling on rightsong
hello everyone my name is Thomas Davisand I live in the North GeorgiaMountains as you can kind of see thereflection in our back deck windows it'sa nice woodsy area and I'm just enjoyinga nice August afternoon while I'msitting here I was thinking about why Iwalked away from the Democratic Party sohere's my story my mom and dad wereRepublicans but they raised me to votemy conscience and oftentimes we wouldvote Democrat sometimes we disagree Ivoted for Carter but I also voted forNixon I voted for Reagan but I alsovoted for Clinton and Obama both twicewhat changed me into a Democratbasically was the invasion of Iraq Ireally thought that was unnecessary andI blamed george w bush for all thoselives lost and money spent so I switchedto the Democratic Party thinking thattheir ideals were better now I've alwaysbeen a supporter of the Second Amendmenteven when I was a flaming liberal andI've always been conservative on somethings but for the most part Itook all the liberal policies to heartand when the 2016 election came around Iwas definitely a Bernie bro I neverliked Hillary I never liked her when shewas a first lady I didn't have a lot offaith in their truth-telling abilitiesbut at the time I didn't really carewhether Clinton had an affair or notbecause the country was in good shapefinancially I have since changed on thatI am really really upset about the factthat I ever voted for him or Obama theObama was such a disappointment to mebut getting back to why I walked awayfrom the Democratic Party in 2016 like Isaid I was a Bernie bro I was all aboutthe free college the free health carethe flee this the free that and I hadslowly been indoctrinated or let's saybrainwashed into believing that all theills of the earth or because of the richso when the DNC and Hillary basicallygave Bernie the screw job that they didmy eyes began to open now I might alsohave mentioned that I had moved fromFlorida which is a liberal haven to theNorth Georgia Mountains in 2012 so I hadplenty of conservative friends and Ifought with them often about my idealsversus their ideals they were alwaysalways respectful kindand treated me as a human even though myviews were radically different fromtheir conservative years now I can't saythat about my liberal friends because Ihad several on Facebook and even inpersonal life when my beliefs began toevolve and when it finally culminatedwith meswitching allegiances from Democratic toRepublican or liberal to conservative Ilost no less than 15 friends why becausethey're intolerantthey are unable to see another point ofview they are mean they said horriblethings to me they are angry they areeight full will you restate that theyare hateful I never had one conservativefriend ever unfriend me or treat me withdisrespect because I believed and allthe birdy bro bull or the Obama bull butthe Liberals dude oh they jumped on mewith both jackboots so in 2016 I votedfor President Donald J Trump I have toadmit that at first it was because I wasjust pissedabout the way the Democratic Partyoperated but I also like the things thathe was saying I didn't believe that itwas going to be possible or that he wasgoing to do the things that he said hewas going to do because most politiciansin my experience have not but he did hehas tried or fulfilled every singlepromise that he made to us on thecampaign trail and we are reaping therewards reaping the rewards so here's mywalkaway moment it happened in 2016 butI'm just telling you about it now in2018 I am so pleased to see there peopleother than myself are waking up to theliberal lies and the harassment they'rethe left puts forthSogo Trump vote conservative and Iwalked away Thomas Davis from the NorthGeorgia Mountainsyou
my name is Michael and I want to thankmy wife for encouraging me to make thisvideo you may have heard of her videolast nighther name's Libby and I really want tothank Brandon for what he did by givingher an opportunity to speak to a largeraudience so I think for me I actuallywalked away long before I even knewthat's what I was doing it probablystarted long back when I started gettingheavily involved with documentaries andstarting to understand how corrupt biggovernment was and how it made a lotmore sense for government to be smallerat the time I thought the solution tothat was Democrats and I was sillyenough to vote for Obama twice honestlynot knowing much about policy butthinking it made sense to give everybodyhealthcare and I've certainly been forexample pro-choice my entire life I'dstill tell you I am but I certainlyunderstand why states want to have muchstricter pro-life laws and I do thinkthere's a lot of hypocrisy out thereespecially with maybe let's say thecurrent immigration system with peoplethat are also ok with babies dying maybea week or two before they could be bornor actually maybe even after they couldpotentially be born and live so there'sthat but now yeah I mean I I take time Iresearch pretty much everything I lookat both sides it's pretty funny the hateand the vitriol that I receive I do notattack people I do not even attackreally what people say I do my best tothink about maybe their perspective Ithink Jordan Peterson's 12 rules is afantastic book and I think you got toget your own house in order first and Ithink I have to take the time tounderstand somebody else's perspectiveand make sure I'm not attacking somebodyelse if what I'm asking for is theDemocrats and liberals not to beattacking us but I will say as much as Idisagree with let's say for example aguy like Sam Harris on his his opinionwith Trump he clearly has a pretty goodidea ofhow bad the left is as compared to theright when it comes to individualfreedoms and that's really probably themost important thing to meso I mean there's so much to talk aboutand my wife can tell you I can prettymuch talk forever but I at least wantedto share a little bit of my story I'mnot even sure if I'm really aconservative I think reading a lot ofdiscussion on Libby's post and onBrandon's post last night maybe I'm anold school liberal who's actually acenter-right conservative nowadays Imean I'm certainly not religiousalthough having two children now Ialmost would like to find religion Igrew up Jewish but I was heavilycriticized by people and a very heavilyJewish City which is kind of strange butyeah so I really hate bigotry andthere's so many people in my family thatliterally are being bigots and don'tunderstand that that's what they'rebeing and then are upset for beingcalled bigots although I'm no longercalling anybody bigots this was probablysix months ago when I was unfriended bymy cousin and my uncle which is kind ofhurtful I can't believe itmy uncle is one of the most freethinkers I thought he was at least andit's hard for me to understand why hewould have unfriended me just because Iwas posting factual articles on one ofhis posts and he insisted that it wasnot factual so that's my story and Ihope more people do post videos III seemore of a red wave than a blue wave inupcoming political elections which willhopefully continue our country on a muchgreater trajectory so I would say leaveyou with one last thought we should allagree that it would make a lot of senseto make America great againmy name is Michael and I want to thankmy wife for

so my kids said hey mom can you at leastbrush your hair and put some makeup onif you're gonna make a video for a bunchof strangers and I thought no I'mkeeping it real they're gonna get toknow me really well right now so I mightas well show them what I look like rightso walking away walking away from me hasbeen an increment it's been baby stepsit's been evolutionary and I didn't justwalk away I walked away a while ago justto give you some background I am alatina born and raised in the boogiedown bronx my dad's boricua Puerto Ricanand my mom is a legal resident a legalimmigrant from Belize and between her mydad I think they raised for prettyamazing children my brothers are bothUnited States Marine Corps veterans andthey both served in Desert Storm mysister's an accountant and she is a 9/11survivor she worked on the 90 floor ofthe first tower that got hit and Isurvived running the streets in theBronx so I guess my first bigdisagreement when my dad was when Iturned 18 this was a while ago I'm 43years old and so the first presidentthat I ever voted for was Bill Clintonand my dad schooled me he did he saidthat I was being brainwashed by themedia and that I was allowing myself tovote for someone who was no good butjust because he was young and hip and Idenied it I denied it to the core but umhe was rightyou know I saw Bill Clinton on MTV andhe had smoked but didn't inhale so Ithought that was pretty cool what ashallow reason to vote for someone rightso anyhow let me give you somebackground on my parents they're bothpretty conservative Christians but Ibelieve that they're beautifulChristians they're what Christianityshould be I vote in the 90s and I hadtransvestites come to my house withtheir big shoes and a big hair and theirpsychedelic clothes because the lightwas groove is in the heart was aand you know my parents have come in theroom do you guys need anything those aremy parents my sister's best friend was agame man during the 1980s and he hadAIDS and his family did not want him itwas taboo to be a gay man in the 80sdying of AIDS but my parents took him inand he died in my home and those are thepeople who raised mebeautiful conservative people with a bigopen heart but even with that solidfoundationI let the osmosis of New York City seepinto me and mold my thinking you knowand I thank God for my parents because Ithink it is that true foundation thatallowed me to seek truth and finally getto where I'm at I turn back to my rootsbut in the middle of all that I livedthe liberal life I worked in the musicindustry I was the manager of the firsthip-hop label label on fever records andfever nightclub and I lived a prettyliberal lifestyle and a lot of mychoices were liberal and you know it wasone of those knuckleheads that thought Iwould never personally have an abortionbut it's okay if you do and and just ahit just supported Planned Parenthood andjust uh just a totally different personthan Who I am so they 43 year old motherfive beautiful children conservativeliving in a different state in thesuburbs and seeing things completelydifferent I guess I started walking awaywhen one of my brothers was diagnosedwith Gulf War Syndrome and he got itfrom the inoculations that he receivedin the Marine Corps it made me startresearching and I realized that thepresident who I voted in Bill Clintonsigned theexecutive order 131 39 the basic Drenders a militaryguinea-pigs the governments allow to dowhatever they want without informedconsent on our military and it's okaybecause of that executive order and sothat was my first mm-hmm and then mysecond son was injured by the MMRvaccine he swelled three times the sizehe got his first asthma attack and hebroke out in a rash from head to toe andwas inconsolable but because a militarydoctor told me that it could never bethe vaccines and I was so trusting ofgovernmental officials that I believedhim and I continued to vaccinate mychildren and my son was injured a secondtime and this time it was undeniable hehad an anaphylactic reaction to the MMRvaccine and he stopped breathing andthat really opened my eyes and it tookme through a rabbit hole where theending is basically hell and then 9/11happened and my sister survived but itmade me really question things becauseour world was changing Homeland Securitywas started the airport was like goingthrough Rikers Islandyou know prison it was just awful andeven early on some people wouldwhispering and saying that it might bean inside job and I didn't believe thatbut three years later someone handed mea VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jonesand this nutjob made a lot of sense andplanted some seeds and so I walked awaya little more slowly I started toquestion things and I think that at thatpoint I registered myself as aRepublican but guess whatmy research took me so far down therabbit hole that I then decided to goparty less and decided to just votepeople on merit andI kept switching back and forth betweenboth parties depending on who I thoughtI wanted to vote in and even then eventhen that I thought I was awake I reallywasn't guys really really wasn't it'sbeen evolutionary and it's been a lot ofresearch and a lot of opening andexpanding of my mind and the reason whyI explained to you my background isbecause I think it took the sort of homethat I grew up in where everyone waswelcome teen moms were pregnant you knowblack white Chinese has mine you knowDominican I mean it was a melting pot inmy parents home they took in the peoplewho were unwanted by some and raisechildren who were abandoned by theparents I think it took this sort ofbackground to keep me open-minded and tomake me research and really startquestioning things because I realizedthat the media was playing us

was allowing myself tovote for someone who was no good butjust because he was young and hip and Idenied it I denied it to the core but umhe was rightyou know I saw Bill Clinton on MTV andhe had smoked but didn't inhale so Ithought that was pretty cool what ashallow reason to vote for someone rightso anyhow let me give you somebackground on my parents they're bothpretty conservative Christians but Ibelieve that they're beautifulChristians they're what Christianityshould be I vote in the 90s and I hadtransvestites come to my house withtheir big shoes and a big hair and theirpsychedelic clothes because the lightwas groove is in the heart was aand you know my parents have come in theroom do you guys need anything those aremy parents my sister's best friend was agame man during the 1980s and he hadAIDS and his family did not want him itwas taboo to be a gay man in the 80sdying of AIDS but my parents took him inand he died in my home and those are thepeople who raised mebeautiful conservative people with a bigopen heart but even with that solidfoundationI let the osmosis of New York City seepinto me and mold my thinking you knowand I thank God for my parents because Ithink it is that true foundation thatallowed me to seek truth and finally getto where I'm at I turn back to my rootsbut in the middle of all that I livedthe liberal life I worked in the musicindustry I was the manager of the firsthip-hop label label on fever records andfever nightclub and I lived a prettyliberal lifestyle and a lot of mychoices were liberal and you know it wasone of those knuckleheads that thought Iwould never personally have an abortionbut it's okay if you do and and just ahit just supported Planned Parenthood andjust uh just a totally different personthan Who I am so they 43 year old motherfive beautiful children conservativeliving in a different state in thesuburbs and seeing things completelydifferent I guess I started walking awaywhen one of my brothers was diagnosedwith Gulf War Syndrome and he got itfrom the inoculations that he receivedin the Marine Corps it made me startresearching and I realized that thepresident who I voted in Bill Clintonsigned theexecutive order 131 39 the basic Drenders a militaryguinea-pigs the governments allow to dowhatever they want without informedconsent on our military and it's okaybecause of that executive order and sothat was my first mm-hmm and then mysecond son was injured by the MMRvaccine he swelled three times the sizehe got his first asthma attack and hebroke out in a rash from head to toe andwas inconsolable but because a militarydoctor told me that it could never bethe vaccines and I was so trusting ofgovernmental officials that I believedhim and I continued to vaccinate mychildren and my son was injured a secondtime and this time it was undeniable hehad an anaphylactic reaction to the MMRvaccine and he stopped breathing andthat really opened my eyes and it tookme through a rabbit hole where theending is basically hell and then 9/11happened and my sister survived but itmade me really question things becauseour world was changing Homeland Securitywas started the airport was like goingthrough Rikers Islandyou know prison it was just awful andeven early on some people wouldwhispering and saying that it might bean inside job and I didn't believe thatbut three years later someone handed mea VCR tape of a nutjob named Alex Jonesand this nutjob made a lot of sense andplanted some seeds and so I walked awaya little more slowly I started toquestion things and I think that at thatpoint I registered myself as aRepublican but guess whatmy research took me so far down therabbit hole that I then decided to goparty less and decided to just votepeople on merit andI kept switching back and forth betweenboth parties depending on who I thoughtI wanted to vote in and even then eventhen that I thought I was awake I reallywasn't guys really really wasn't it'sbeen evolutionary and it's been a lot ofresearch and a lot of opening andexpanding of my mind and the reason whyI explained to you my background isbecause I think it took the sort of homethat I grew up in where everyone waswelcome teen moms were pregnant you knowblack white Chinese has mine you knowDominican I mean it was a melting pot inmy parents home they took in the peoplewho were unwanted by some and raisechildren who were abandoned by theparents I think it took this sort ofbackground to keep me open-minded and tomake me research and really startquestioning things because I realizedthat the media was playing us thateverything was connected the presidentthe agendas you know my son's injury mybrother's injury researching health andvaccines and and seeing that some stateshave made it mandatory for children tobe vaccinated in order to go to schoolif something is so good for you why doyou have to mandate it and I don't wantto start a debate here I'm all aboutchoice I'm all about informing peopleand giving them choice and the thing isthat no one informed me when I was ayoung mom even when I questioned that ittold me it was safe and effective and Iguess all those things health thepharmaceutical industry the politicscelebrities because being coming from aworld where I worked in a world ofcelebrities hip-hop singers and then Iswitched over to the Latin scene and Iknow I'm not gonna mention it but Iworked for some really big Latin artistsha's and I got to see that world too andin my research I realized that it's allconnected the leads the Cabal CPSvaccines pharmaceuticals money greed Imean it's a big rabbit hole and thething isSociety you know we're normal workingpeople a lot of us you know I'm blessedto be a stay-at-home mom my you know myhusband works and we have a beautifulhome and I get to stay home with ourchildren we sacrificed a lot so I don'twant anyone to think that I'm privilegedI've been called a privileged whiteperson when I'm not white second I'm notprivileged my husband and I have bustedour behind so everything that we haveand we sacrifice a lot but I lost mytrain of thought but my thought I thinkI was going with a lot of people um Ohdivisionthe media tries to play us and divide usand people who meet me now and see me asa conservative Christian stay home momhomeschooling mama five theyautomatically assume things about methey think that I'm hateful that I'mhomophobic that I was born with a silverspoon in my mouthyou know it's so ridiculous and knowingmy roots knowing that I was born andraised in the Bronx by two hard-workingpeople knowing the type of home that Icame from it kind of pisses me off thatpeople assume that I'm privileged but Iguess what I want people to take awayfrom this is that the first step sowalking away is educating yourselfwhatever it took to open your eyes tapin on that and delve into other realmsbecause you will see that it's allconnected and a lot of what we've beentold are lies a lot of it I have abackground in the medical industry I'm alactation consultant I worked for theHealth Department I went to nursingschool and what I realized is that BigPharma has their dirty little hands anda lot of things in textbooks and whatwe're taught they support wings andhospitals if there's money there's apossibility of getting in there this ishow formula companies were able to gettheir formulas into goodie bags that arehanded out to new parents everythingeverything has a purpose everything isdonefor a purpose and I guess but I wantpeople to take away from this is that ifa kid from the Bronx who grew up and wasraised in the ghetto can get out canopen and expand her mind and can seethings for what they really are so canyou so can youwe can all do it and we don't have tolove each other's choices and we don'thave to agree on everything but we canlove one another as human beings and wecould come to common ground and we couldwork together to bring a beautiful andbrighter future for all that's the thingwe don't have to be divided just becauseI voted for Trump doesn't mean that Iagree with everything he says I don'tfollow anyone blind me just because Ivoted for Trump doesn't mean that I'mprivileged just because I'm a Christiandoesn't mean I'm homophobic um I havegay cousins who I loveI grew up voguing and I had I grew upwith a gay man living in my home youknow like just because we are certainthings doesn't define the whole of us asa person so I guess my video is that wecan all come from different walksdifferent views and still walk away andstill hold our hands together and stillfight for good if a good country godbless my children follow me

hi everybody I'm a little nervous soplease bear with me as I sort of stumblestumble my way through this story I'venever told this story in public so youguys are the first to hear the story nowmost of my friends now who know me herein 2018 it's pretty public knowledgethat I am a socially conservativeeconomic libertarian who supports themilitary but doesn't want to donation-building I guess that's where Iam politically I am not registered inany party I have never campaigned forany candidate very politically activeand informed but registered independentthat's kind of where I am and for myfriends who know me in this way most ofthem have no idea how radical and wackyI was as a young adult and I guess Iwanted to talk about how young peopleget sucked into really radical ideologyand what shook me out of it so for me mystory it began for me basically in mychildhood because I grew up in veryextreme poverty my parents were prettymuch the epitome of white trash and I'mnot saying that in a condemning kind ofway at all they they know this they weredoing the best they couldit just was what it was but we were inpretty extreme poverty and for me as achild living in that world I was bulliedquite a bit I really didn't have anyfriends and judging from the grown-upsin my family I didn't have a whole lotto look forward to so I wanted somethingbetter and I was searching for kind of away to get out of that ditchand when you live in that environmentthe only political social option thereis is the Democrat Party when I wasyoung it was made clear to me in nouncertain terms the Republican Party isa private club for millionaires and theymade their fortune by unscrupulous meansjust period we didn't know anyRepublicans never met a millionaire inour life but we were quite sure that allof them were unscrupulous and they hadtheir own private club so for me to getinvolved in any kind of social justiceor whatever I was nudged to the left bydefault so you kind of you start downthis road wanting happiness love andfairness and for everybody to be happyand having a food that that's why youstart down the road but somewhere in theprocess it starts getting ugly andusually what happens is you beginwanting tolerance wanting inclusion butall of a sudden as you go you startlooking for excuses to disqualify peopleand that's always step one and it'snever anything personal it's alwaysabout a philosophy or a policy or asocial demographic that's what it iseverything is cast in terms of abstractdemographics institutions it's neverpersonal it's always demographic so youstart off down this road and you startdisqualifying well why should I botherdefending millionaires millionaireRepublicans what do they need me for andthat's the little sleight of hand I'mdefending the little guy what do theyneed my help for they don't need medefending themnow they they're getting along withoutme they don't care about me I'm nevergonna meet them they're never gonnanotice if I hate them or not so whatdifference does it makeso they're disqualified I'm not a socialjustice campaign for everyone with themand then you start moving a littlefurther and then you say oh you know I'mgoing to disqualify those successfulpeople with a nuclear family you knowthey're disqualified because they don'tunderstand what the struggle is andthey're probably all just cheating ontheir spouses and hypocrites anyways andthey don't need my help so they'll nevernotice if I hate themso they're disqualified and then you godown a little further and then you pickoff someone else and then you pick offsomeone else and next thing you knowyou're marching down this road let's getmore and more narrow and it's never apersonal thing about the lady sittingnext to you it's always abstract and atthe time that I was getting into this Iwas really hoping like okay this is thisis like how will you bring about socialjustice this is how you make thingsbetter and years would go by andelections would happen and we would havethis governor that governor and nothingwas ever changing and I wasn't seeingany good out of this and you know youwould hear people say you know theDemocrats are morally bankrupt and theleft is an empty ideology you would hearthese things but it couldn't be trueright because you're investing all ofyour energy into this fight for thecause and it can't be an empty ideologyso then you're searching for the meaningbehind it so then you're going furtherand further into the the thoughts andthe thought leaders behind this leftistideology and you're going further andfurther down the road and it's gettingmore and more narrow so then by the timethat I was in high school I hooked upwiththis whole group of friends who werereally far left I mean we were doingsome pretty radical stuff we actuallyhad a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook I'mnot kidding I remember writing papers inschool in defense of domestic terrorismmy friends and I mean they were theydabbled in witchcraft they dabbled insexual perversion experimenting theydabbled in reading nihilisticphilosophers I mean this was the worldthat I lived in pretty much day in andday out like those were my friends thatwas my social sceneI actually remember being in high schooland starting a petition against my highschool newspaper because I thought ithad a Christian bias I seriously didremember doing that that's just kind ofa few examples of the world that I wasliving in and you're going down thisroad and you're just bypassingeverything that is common senseeverything that is rational everythingthat makes society stay together and Ididn't even realize that I was beingsystemic ly divorced from the normalhuman experience that's what it isthat's what leftist ideology is it is aprocess of divorcing you from the normalhuman experience and it is done throughthe guise of first of all divorcing youfrom the people sitting next to you andgetting your attention on some kind ofabstract machination and the end resultwhere this is going is that you willburn every Bridge you will run out ofoptions and you will be totally alonethat's the end result that's where itgoes but nobody tells you thatwhen you're walking down the road and Iactually remember this is I rememberthere were several times when there wasthis moment of divine intervention whensomething would happen to shake me likesomething dramatic would happen and thisdoor would be kicked open for someone totalk sense into me and every time thathappened there was always a conservativeRepublican religious sort of person whowas right there like this this goldenopportunity fell in their lap to talk tome and just when they had me on theropes they dropped the ball they gave upthey backed off maybe they thought thattheir job was in jeopardy maybe theywere afraid of retribution I don't knowwhat it was but more than once when Iwas going down that road there was somekind of supernatural effort to stop meand the judeo-christian conservativepeople who had chances to get through tome consistently missed it because notbecause they were nasty but because theywere always guarded and quiet and almostunwilling to defend the Bible they wouldcome right up to that edge and then Iguess they were afraid that I would beoffended or whatever and just when I wason the ropes they would stop and Idefinitely want to encourageconservative Republicans out therelistening if you've got a young personyou're talking to and you feel thisboldness come over you to say somethingthen you need to say something becauseyou never know when that young personcould be being bulliedor could be depressed and leftistideology might be their coping mechanismand you never know when you are in themidst of a moment when you can talksense into them so if you're in thatsituation and you feel this boldnesscoming up to you and you feel likeyou've got them on the ropes you need tobe bold and you need to launch into aimpassioned defense of judeo-christianphilosophy I'm telling you you need tobecause I'm looking back on my life andI'm realizing if those people had beenas bold as what the leftists are cuz theleftists are johnny-on-the-spot with ananswer and they're they don't stop thereon it and if some of those people in mylife on the right if they had been thataudacious they could have taken me tothe match but they blinked so I wasgoing further and further down this roadgetting more and more radical and all ofmy friends were doing that and thiscarried on until I was my senior year ofhigh school and I actually remember Igraduated high school in 1998 but Iremember when Columbine happened in 1999I was not surprised because I understoodthat whole scene to those of us who hadthat experience Columbine was completelyunderstandable and there's a lot ofyoung people right now who are goingthrough are getting sucked down thatsame path now thank God for me that Inever went so far as shooting up aschool but I wasn't too far off so Ireally thought by the time that Ireached high school senior highI really thought like this world sucksthere's nothing to look/ - everybody's wrong everybody hates meand I was alone because that's what itdoes to you you end up alone and thebiggest thing that I remember feelingwas darkness by the time that I made itto my high school senior year I hadalready survived two suicide attemptsthat's that's true the second one wasactually bad enough that I missed schoolfor a week and I kept going down thisroad thinking like I got into this forsocial justice any day now it'll getbetter I'm gonna find something real Ihave to find something real at the endof this road and I never did and when Igraduated high school I was literally atthe point I thought I was losing my mindand something had to change and finallyagain I was given another challenge toread the Bible and this time I didn'thave anything to lose I said I'll giveit a try now I don't want to make thisvideo religious so I don't want to getsidetracked with my journey to becominga Christian if anybody wants to knowthat story I'll be happy to tell itlater but the Bible was my gateway intoa political change and the thing thatreally changed me was when I startedreading the Bible and really listeningand paying attention and noticing thispattern all throughout the Biblelove your neighbor love your enemy honoryour parents live at peace with all menyou know all of these great idealspeople claim they want but I remember inthe Bible it was always in the contextof a personal friendship it was neverabout an institution it was always aboutthe person sitting next to youeverything in that whole book is aboutpeople and not institutions and youmight be hearing that thinking oh that'scommon sense this was like breaking newsto me this rocked my world and I startedsitting back saying wait a second now Ican't start from the position of being apetulant sarcastic little snitch andthen somehow think that that willproduce more virtue in society like oneof those things does not lead to theotherthat light boats started going off in myhead for the first time ever it wasbreaking news to me and it reallyrattled what I thought I knew aboutculture and society so then I startedwalking through it like wait a secondhere my personal life and the people Imeet in my daily life that is my littlesandbox to practice loving well tocultivate virtue to cultivate anatmosphere of heaven in my world becauseI can't control the government I cancontrol my world and maybe if I did thatand you did that and we all did that atthe same time then our society wouldturn aroundthat was a huge paradigm shift for mewhen I was probably 21 or 22 when thatreally started sinking in so then I wentoff on a mission to try to findlike-minded people who were actuallypracticing personal virtue I went off tofind those peopleand lo and behold I didn't find them onthe left and I didn't find themgenerally speaking in the Democrat Partythere are some good Democrats out thereI'm not I'm not trying to stereotype thewhole party there are a lot of goodpeople who are sort of moderate Centerleftists I am not discounting you butwhat I am saying is I have seen thefurther you go down that leftist Roadthe less light there is and when Istarted comparing personal applicationof love to what I saw from radicalleftists there was just there was noreconciling it was they were so milesapart that I was just like these peopleare the opposite of what the Bible saysliterally so I had no choice all I didwas just start saying okay I'm gonnameet this person right in front of meignore their skin color ignore theirsocial class and just throw all that tothe side look at them as an individualand watch their behavior that's all Idid and I started seeing a crystal cleardifference between people on the leftand then the normal sensible people whoare a part of that normal humanexperience so that's what pulled me muchmore over to the political right andthat's where I am today and like I saidyou might be listening to this and youmight be thinking oh that's Christianity101 or that's Judeo that's Westerncivilization 101 but I'm here to tellyou you cannot take it for granted butthat's common sense anymore you can'tand so many people conservatives peopleon the right they waste so much timeit's Hawking until they're blue in theface saying I love everyone I just I doI just love everyone believe me I loveeveryonebut listen you got to understand whenyou're talking to a radical socialistthe word love doesn't mean what youthink it means to them and when you talkabout loving people you really can'ttake it for granted but they know whatthat word means and the whole time I wassearching for something real I neverheard a good articulation of thatdifference I heard you know talkingabout God's love I heard those thingsbandied about I heard the gospel bandiedabout but I never had it hit home for meso I'm here to sort of encourage otherpeople if you've got a young person inyour life or you know a young person areyou encounter a young person who seemsto be brainwashed by leftist ideologyfirst of all you need to feel sorry forthem because it really is brainwashingand second of all you got to strip itall the way down to the basics don'ttake it for granted that you're usingthe same dictionary because you're notreally think hard about what you believethe underpinnings of what you believethe underpinnings of Westerncivilization you got to come back downto that level and you need to articulatea defence of Western civilization that'swhat you need to do and if you do thatconsistently boldly not being afraid ofoffending them if you go in assumingthat what you believe is offensivethat's a defeatist mentality don't go inthere being on guard saying well I knowyou won't believe me but this is what Ibelieve you've already defeated yourselfbe bold be proud of yourself and startcoming up with anargument that's better than an apologyand I am here to encourage you that ifyou do that you can start making adifference in more young people's livesyou

hi this is my walkaway video I wanted toI had done one before and it got cut offso we're doing it and I'm really gladI'm doing a second one because I've it'smore in-depth that I think we mightphrase it as it's not walking away fromthe Democrats or democratic plantationalthough that's part of it but we'rereally walking away from is the erosionof the Constitution is the disparagingand diminishing attitude towards whatthe Founding Fathers established as theUnited States of America so mine I'llmake it short what could be long butI've seen some really short ones andthey're fantasticum is that I was raised in a veryleft-wing household my father was Iwon't even say a rabid liberal though Iused to frame him that way or refer tohim that way but he have she wascommunistic he tried to join theCommunist Party during I think it wasWorld War two he dodged getting into hewasn't even he was a draft dodgerbasically he pretended he was insane sothey wouldn't draft him into the armywhich is really shameful but his brotherwent in I think he was in the Marinesbut anyway hate my father was not intothat I think he was terrified to deathto be honest in any case he fed me andmy sister daily on what his beliefsystem was which was anti-governmentanti-american he was a first generationimmigrant on second generation on hisside his parents could literally cameover from Sicily on Ellis Island youknow they'd have a name change cuz hername wasn't that difficult otherwisethey would and my grandparents made areal life here they my grandmother was aseamstress my grandfather was a tailorray Sicilian traditionaloccupations and they may have their ownbusinesses and own property and even alittle oil derrick and they did well forthemselves here and they didn't complainabout America or hate it in fact theywere so blessed and so appreciative myfather for whatever reason hated it andtransferred that to me like throughosmosis and and through very definitestatements continually through mychildhood so I grew up that way and Iwas a bleeding-heart liberal and I didall liberal things in protests and it'sjust you know had that view thatworldview and and the worldview whereyou don't think for yourself where youdon't examine you don't question youknow it's important to question any sideso in the end when my son right after myson was born nineteen years ago I cameto Christ and in that amazingtransformation of becoming a newcreature in him over a period ofprobably two years I would say two tothree years my politics completelychanged and I started realizing thatconservatism wasn't the enemy that it Ihad shared the same morals the samevalues and I was changed on the insideso I wasn't this renegade person whojust wanted my own way to do what Iwanted and nobody tell me what to dothat was gone for me and I renounced allthat stuff I didn't want it in my lifebecause it's just self-centered reallyand then you justify yourself centeredmissing in any case now once when in the2016 elections just before and I was I'dbeen living in Australia for many manyyears where I came to Christ and I cameback the Lord was leading me back Iworked with Native American kids on areservation and that was during theelection and they were incredibly bluethere but the most of the state I was inSouth Dakota was red in any case but itwas like you felt you could not sayanything and when I came back to AmericaI couldn't believe how divided it was itwasn't it was just shocking and sodisheartening in nonetheless I got tovote in the snow for president Trumpbefore he was president I'd been prayingfor him for months I hadn't wanted tovote for him initially I was a benCarson person but when he decided tostop campaigning and he withdrew I justlooked to the Lord and said well Who amI going to support now what is this Lordand when he told me it was Trump I waslike huh what that man and then heshowed me behind the scenes what wasreally going on and how we needed a manlike that for this time someone whocould you know we didn't pull anypunches someone who in the dogfight ofthe media would actually come up on topbecause they are vicious and people whoare soft-spoken or not fighters are justnot gonna make it in this kind of systemand the dog chooses who he chooses likehe chose Cyrus and he brought Israelback to its senses and I believe this ispart of the plan for a present Trump tobring America back to its senses and andto honor the Constitution it's like theConstitution is absolutely beendesecrated for four decades now andwhether it's a second Amendment whetherit's the lack of value for life lifeitself inside we're outside the wombwhere the people's rights are diminishedthe surveillance all of that it's weneed to return to what this country wasfounded on and I believe that's whatwe're really walking away from thecorruption not just the left yes theleft it can be it can be a myriad ofdifferent stances but yeah the leftembodies it but it's walking away fromthe line that this countryis to be run by money mongers by thepolitical elite by globalists know thiscountry is to be run for buy and leavethe people and I'm so thankful that Iwas shown through the Lord what reallymatters and each one of us does andthat's what this country should be aboutso god bless you all and that's my walkaway[Music]
my name is Nicole I'm from NorthCarolina and I've got some notes herebecause I don't want to ramble on and Ido want to make a couple of points soyou'll send me look down every once in awhile I just want to give you quickly mybackground I'm a registered independentI am in my 50s and I had always votedkind of a mixture of both Democrats andRepublicans and I did that early onbecause I felt like it was a goodbalance like we needed a balance ofthought in our government and amongpolicy makers but as time progressedthrough the 80s into the 90s I could seekind of the fringes of the radical leftbeginning to creep into the Democratsand I had become concerned about thatand so I started still voting a mixtureof Democrats and Republicans but I keptthat mixture more on a local level andvoted more conservative on the federallevel then kind of move into the early2000s I have a friend who is very activein women's issues she's a strictfeminist and she was part of her localDemocrat Party organization and we werediscussing some issues and she keptcoming back around to the phrase of wellthe ends justify the means and I cannotget on board with that and I know whenat first I thought it was just her butthen when I came to learn more about theDemocrats that's really where they comefrom and I'm not gonna say all Democratsactually my mother is a registeredDemocrat and she walked away from theDemocrat Party a long time ago she justnever changed her affiliation officiallyat the at the voting office becauseshe said that she likes to get intodiscussions and then when people accuseher of oh well you're just a Republicanyou won't understand and she says no I'ma registered Democrat so she's one ofthose who says that the Democrat Partywalked away from her a long time ago somy mother is a registered Democrat Ihave a sister that's a registeredRepublican who votes straight Republicanticket and has for a long time so wecome from a pretty diverse you knowpolitical thought within our family butanyway getting back to my friend yeahthey pretty much hold the the thought ofthe ends justify the means that meansthat they can lie if they need to cheatif they need to exhort you know or moveinto violence if they need to and tothem as long as they meet there in gameit doesn't matter to them how they getthere and I cannot go along with thatyou know there's you have to have amoral compass which guides you in youreveryday life and how you approachproblems and how you approach policy sothat was one thing that really put myradar up regarding the Democrats nowthat was back in early 2000 they havesince continued to move in thatdirection I started to do some homeworkfor myself and I found out more aboutthe infiltration of the Democrat Partyby the Communist Party USA and theagenda of the Communist Party and theagenda of the Communist Party if you goand do your own homework really is to isto conquer different enterprises withinthe United States which gives them powerand those enterprises are academiaHollywood the media healthcare that wasa big onethere's several others but those aresome of the and you can see itexactly where they have crept in andthen taken a foothold in those things inorder to sway Americans their thoughtand for them to gain power in Americanpolitics and their agenda in that sensehas worked and you know that's beensomething that's been going on fordecades they've been progressing slowlybut surely but it comes from a Marxistbackground so when Barack Obama came onthe scene in 2008 excuse me my husbandand I my husband who's actually fromNorth Africa he is Jewish and we werewatching all the things about you knowthe 2008 campaign and we began to atfirst we were kind of impressed withBarack Obama and I you know I began tothink hey listen maybe this is somebodyI can get behind I kind of I like toswagger I like the way he spoke he wasyou know but that was very early in hiscampaign and said my husband and I didsome homework on him and found out thathe was actually very entrenched inMarxism I could not get behind that Ialready haven't done my homework on whatwas going on with the Democrats and theinfiltration by the Communist Party USAand what their agenda was and and thefact that the ends justifies the meansso it didn't matter that he could standup there and lie to everybody's facesknowing that that he had an agendatowards something else because that'swhat they dowhen I found out about his backgroundmore about his background more about hisupbringing more about who it was thatwas his mentor then you know I was I wastotally mm-hmm I was like there's no wayI'm pulling the lever for him of coursehe won and we endured eight years of himand then along came Hillary Clinton andwith Hillary then we just got more ofthe continuation of the same thing ofthe ends justifies the means now we'regoing to resort to violence now we'regoing to divide people even furtherBarack Obama did a good job of thatduring his eight years alienating peopledividing people stirring up hate andthat's what the Democrats do they createa crisis then they blame the crisis onother people and then they theyintroduce their solution to the crisiswhich is themselves so because for themthe ends justifies the means so you knowback in the 2000 2000s I just quitvoting for Democrats even though I hadvoted a mixture before so I walked awayfrom them during that time my motherwalked away from them a long time agoand my husband has never voted for aDemocrat my sister votes straightRepublican ticket so I'm still aregistered independent and I willcontinue to be I lean more towardconservative and libertarian and mythoughts on the Constitution is is thestrongest document ever written by anygovernment trying to secure the freedomof people and given giving them a voicein their government so if it is appliedcorrectly and it needs to be appliedcorrectly but it is not outdated it is avery strong document and I think it'sthe best one ever written for anycountry to the people that have walkedaway and are you know were caught up inBarack Obama and Hillary Clinton and allthe pomp and circumstance we you knowsurrounding them and still have friendsentrenched in that that mindset I justwant you to know by coming you know tothis group I think that you're finding ahome it does not mean that you have togo and register as a Republican itdoesn't mean that that it doesn't meananything other than you have a placehere to have freedom of thought freedomof speecheach and piece in your life that you'renot going to be attacked for yourthoughts that we all love you and you'reaccepted here and one thing that I willtell you and this is for my fellow youknow Christians out there anybody who'sGod believing if that's not you andyou're not into that just give me amoment now come back around but I'mspeaking to those other ones you knowI've been praying for a long time forGod to begin to wake people up and I'vebeen praying what Jesus said thatthere's nothing hidden that shall not berevealed and I'm glad that things arebeing revealed and I'm glad that there'speace coming to all of our citizens asAmericans so continue to pray with me onthat on that in but the last thing thatI'm going to say is the only wave Ithink that the Democrats are going tosee coming up is this group of peoplewaving goodbye okay so we love you allI'm glad that you're here I'm glad thatyou're part of free thinkers independentthinkers I want you to continue to doyour homework I want you to continue toresearch the Constitution if you'venever done that and I want you to findout more about the convention of statesarticle five convention of states andthe movement going on across our nationright now regarding that which hasalready been passed in several statehouses which is very important becausethat gives a lot more power and voice tothe people so anyway I love you allAmerica I'm glad to be a part of this Iwill be a part of Brandon's walk onWashington when that's organized so Ihope to see you there okay love you upbyeyoumy name is Nicole I'm from NorthCarolina and I've got some notes herebecause I don't want to ramble on and Ido want

hey Ivy easily make this video an hourtwo hours long I tend to ramble so I'mgoing to a little bit of editing to makesure that I am getting some main pointsI wonder across and so first BAMobviously I'm a drag queen so I wantedto share this video in drag because Iwant to break some stereotypes aboutbeing a drag queen being trans being inthe queer community being a minority youdon't need to follow a certain set ofrules you don't need to follow certainrestrictions and in fact this time theopposite of what we're all workingtowards in terms of getting to a placewhere we can have self-government andnot have to worry about what otherpeople think about us I am someone whois always had been against bigcorporations big banks rough governmentunfair policing I was actually in st.Louis during the Mike Brown shooting andI was part of my clubs matter rallieswanting to make sure that there weren'tpeople being mistreatedthere weren't unjust policies in placeso I'm someone who cares very much aboutthe underdog and I want to make surethat everyone is getting a voice andbeing heard when I do drag I don'treally do a lot of performing I don't doit to make money and I like to go outmake people feel special help peoplekind of find that inner energy inthemselves to feel special aboutthemselves I think in society there's avery low level of interaction that wecurrently have and a lot of times in thegrand scheme of things we kind of forgetabout individual people I didn't know myparents I was abused as a child and thatkind of upbringing raised me to field Ialways need to question authority and Ialways need to make sure that people arebeing heard and that we're understandingthat people need to be understood ofwhere they might have come from that youdon't know what that is you don't knowwhat they've been through I alwaysthought the liberal side of the argumentwas the correct side aside for justiceand goodwill and caring about people andI tended to see that conservative sideas being kind of overzealous religiousnot trying much about people and kind offocusing on money somebody's back Imoved torecive area and I think that saturationof seeing a lot of progressive people inthe same spot has kind of started toshow me what's going on I started tonotice a lot of people who wereextremely intolerant but they said theywere the most tolerant people around youhad to watch everything you sat aroundthem you know to watch everything youdid around them your freedom was prettymuch gone and subject to their controlthere was still a lot of jokes andnegativity around but it was basicallydecided that you needed to direct thatat the groups that we don't like whystraight says Christian male and as aminority if you didn't join in with thatif he didn't join in with attackingthose groups so if you said hey maybe weshould attack them quite so harshlymaybe we should accept people then youkind of lost your minority card so likeif you're black they'd say oh why areyou white if you're gay you lose yourgay card really silly stuff and theweird thing is that can't treat you likeyou're not on minority anymore likeyou're part of the problem now which isweird because you are still a minorityif you really think about it all thesepeople everyone talking about howthey're other how they have concernsabout the liberal community is stillvery much minority and the fact thattheir voices aren't being respected bythe community is a huge red flag and thepeople they attack they attack with hateand malice and spite and and disturbingcomments if you took some of thecomments on Twitter and Facebook and youreplace the majority groups withminority groups the comments would beobviously disgusting hate speech butthey always have some kind of excuse thenew definition of racismoh I'm I have I'm a minority I'm aminority so I have a lot of aggressionbuilt up oh they had it coming they hadtheir time they were mean to us and Imean be mean to them that wasn't thebiggest wake up rose for me scene wassupposed to be an inclusive communityattacking and eating itself and thepeople that it was supposed to besupporting and protecting it reallywasn't doing that

there alwaysneeds to be someone else who's theproblem so they keep finding someonewho's the new problemI'm seeing new articles were nowgay black and Asian men are the newproblem and it's silly it's absolutelyridiculous to keep just moving the blamefrom group to group to group to group infixing nothing understand sharing ahelpful ideology like explaining why youwant to protect minority is why youmight want to support a certain causebut that's not what's happening what'shappening is that no one's teachinganyone anything that's just hatefulattacks and shaming while I was slowlylosing my

to me what kind ofauthoritarian takeover has beenhappening for quite a while in the daycommunity we lost a freedom we lost ourvoices we lost the ability to take thecommunity and say hey I don't like thedirection we're going with this youcan't do that anymore it's not in yourhands because we're listening topoliticians and if we're just listeningto politicians then what's the point ofany of thiswhy

hi walk away movement I'm Sabrina andthis is kind of my little walk awaystory whatever I can't say that I was Idon't know when I was younger you know Ivoted for Clinton I really liked what hesaid things he did I felt he did reallygood for the economy I didn't reallycare what was going on with all thesexual bedroom stuff that was betweenhim and his wife and then came Bush andI liked him so I voted for him and thenhe fast-forward up to Obama and I didn'tlike him uh I didn't know anything abouthim I felt that he wasn't qualifiedenough that he didn't have enoughexperience I didn't even think about himbeing black or white because he wasmixedyou know white mama raised by his whitemama and I didn't like him some abouthim and when he talked I felt like aused car salesman talking or somethingand I'd get the little hairs on the backof my neck stand up so you know I waslike hmm I'm not voting for him I don'tknow much about him I I just I didn'tlike him and I didn't really like Ithink it was what McCain or somethingthat was running I didn't care for himeither and but I did like Sarah Palinand so I went that direction cuz I likedheard the Bulldog mom you know I relatedto her the issues that she had you knowshe lived a real life and that was me sothat's the way I had voted well mydaughter who is probably won't very oneof the least racist persons I've everright she had black friends many of themokay with the houses she went to theirhouse who they hug out dated black guysshe I guess her friends have found out Iwasn't voting for Obama and they decidedthey couldn't be friends with her nomore brought the bus home the wrong bushome several of them got off at her busstop and proceeded to jump her I endedup having to take her to the emergencyroom they broke her nose busted her eyesupnothing like deadly serious or anythingbut it was enough for me to step backwhoa what what why you know these areyour friends they know you're not racistand that's when I noticed the dividestart happening right then it was like Iwatched people who had been friends for20 years you know become unfriendbecause you're racist all of a suddenyou don't like Obama you're racist ohyou're racist you know like Obama ohyou're right it was like a nine stopthing and he hadn't even been electedyet and it was already startingfast-forward through his um presidencythe first term I just I saw it thedivide was I've never seen it so bad youknow of course I'm not old enough tohave been back in those days but for mylife I had never seen racism come out sobadly as it was becoming you knoweverybody was racist all of a sudden andyou know I was watching my countrybecome tore apart so come the secondtime I was like I am definitely notvoting for this guy you know I I didn'tlike him didn't like him nails on achalkboard when he talked I couldn'twatch him I'm watching the debates onthe second time and every time he talkedI could just cringe and don't get mewrong because theydidn't like the other two either but ofcourse I voted the other two because atleast their beliefs were more instanding with mine in at the time I wasvery angry with Obama for the dividethat was happening in our country sothen you fast forward you know to theTrump saying he he's gonna run well I'vealways liked Trump and if you knowanything about trunk he leaned moredemocratic anyways he only ranRepublican because that was the tickethe had to have to run on because youknow they were already going for Hillaryon the Democrat side but I liked himI've always liked him when I was youngerand I was taking a psychology course wehad to do a paper on Sam Walton andTrump and the differences and how theywere raised and how they did theirbusinesses all this stuff so I had toresearch both of them and I found Trumpto be very generous he was he's verygenerous he does a lot of behind thescene things that you don't even knowabout and then you know he was alwayswith people like Oprah you know him anOprah really good friends and this is ablack woman and he was friends with alot of black people that are out therein the public eye right now that hatehim but they were friends and loved himand loved the money he gave to theircauses and you know things he helpedthem do and I blame Obama for the racismstuff I just I really blame Obama forthe racism stuff but anyways I'm sorry Igot off-track this is a man who has puthis life on hold to come in and helpAmerica to become what it once was youknow the the land of the free you knowyou used to always hear those thingswhere people say you know 2.5 kids whitepicket fences the American Dream youno that's been caught a long time peoplehave been struggling for a very longtime and here he comes and he's like I'mgonna fix this I'm gonna fix this andhe's been trying and he's done a lot sofar but he could only do so muchwithout the Congress and the Senate'shelp I guess people don't understandthat oh you can just write executiveorders but that's not what he wants hewants us to come together as a unityes he's harsh yes he says things thatbut that's who he iswhat you see is what you get and hethat's who he is but he is not racistand I'm watching how our DemocraticParty has just I mean they they've gonetoo far they are you've got homelesspeople living in tent cities all acrossthe country you've got what do they sayone in five children go to

walk away startedway way back in the late 90searly thousands when i was studying formy first bachelor's degreei was at one of my local colleges wherei'dchosen to go to school from an early ageandi was studying journalism at the timeone of my instructors one daywas teaching us about the quote unquotebig fiveand that was the point that i learnedthat 93of the world's news media outlets areowned by five companiesthis was where i learned that you willnever see anything that is notfamily friendly on abc because they areowned by disneythis will come into play much later onafterhillary got the nomination anywayduring my time at the universityone of the requirements in my departmentwas that you had to do an internshipwell it just sohappened that my internship was to takeplace in 20002000 if you guys will recall was theelectionwhere the supreme court eventually hadto decide that george bush won theelection because it was too close tocallwell my internship was withal gore's presidential campaign in 2000i worked in the communications areawhich is just a fancy word for sayingthat i worked in the mail roomi was a hardcore democratat that time of course because i grew upin a family full of democratsmy grandmother wasinto local politics here in the countythat i now liveas a school teacher because we lived intennesseeshe worked pretty heavily with the gorefamily she actually receivedan invitation to the inauguration afterclinton was electedwhich would have been really exciting ifwe could have gotten a hotel room butanywayso i went to work for al gore's campaignat the campaign headquarters innashvilleso that was where i first got mymy insider's view on how politics worksbecause the dnc headquarterswere there in the building where i wasworking the first thing that i saw thatithat just struck me as being odd was iwould seemembers of the public come through thedoor right next to my office in themailroomwith stacks and stacks of bush signs intheir hands and i couldn't figure outwhyi mean they would disappear around thecorner and i was busy doing my work soit didn't occur to me to askwhere they were going or what they weredoing it just so happened that i foundout from my supervisor one day i kind ofoften mentionedseeing a guy come in with a stack likelike thisof signs and i said why are we bringingbush signs into the building and sheleftshe said oh you don't know about thebonus program and i said what bonusprogram and she saidwe pay members of the public 25 cents asignand i was like are you kidding they'regoing into people's yards and takingtheirsigns to bring them in to get paid andsheleft and she said yeah i mean we don'twant people toto know that there are people innashville that are voting for bushand i was like that doesn't quite passthe smell test shall we sayi mean i was i was probablylet's see i was18 when i voted for clinton the firsttime so by that point in time i hadalready voted for clinton twiceand was very excited at the prospect ofbeing able to vote for al gore becausehe would have been the third electionthat i had voted in by that pointbecause i spent 10 yearsstudying for my first bachelor's degreeso i'm like nearing thethe very end at that point soi'm kind of watching the way that thecampaign is being runi reached the point where i became sojaded working in the mail roommy job in the mail room was to open uplettersfigure out what subject the person waswriting about and then we had littlebaskets scattered around the room forletters where we would take the envelopeand staple it to the back of the letterif it had the person's return address onit if you wrote a letter to al gorein 2000 and received a form letterchances are good i was the person thatput yourname and address in the database to havea letter sent to youso that was my job well you can imaginealong with letters people also mailedchecks and it was at that point that ilearnedif the check is up to a certain amountstaple the check to the letter and putit in this basket over herebut if the check is over this amountwhich of course i didn't realize was thelimit to how much a person could write acheck for to donate to a campaigni was to take the check and the letterin handto al gore's war room and pass it off toa member of their staffi'll get more into that later on butanyway i reached the point where i didnot watch the news anymorebecause i knew every time we made amistake because we would get an influxof letters telling us exactly why wemade a mistakei tracked how well the campaign wasdoing from the number of letters that wegot in my mail room every weekso you can imagine as the electionprogressed it's getting closer toelection timethey brought all of us in communicationstogether and explain that after acertain day we wouldn't be sending outany more letters because they wanted tomake sure that the letters got to peoplebefore election daynot an uncommon practice butinstead of putting people's names in thecomputer likethat was my normal jobthe last two weeks of the campaignbecause i wasn't sending out lettersanymorethey brought me with a chairand a shredder they sat me downin the big open area where the where thecampaign office wasand explained to me that i was going tobe shreddingdocuments for the campaign because i hadto do something i meani was i was already there sothey brought a box like big box oflettersset them down next to me and told me runthese through the shredder when it whenthe bag is fulltake it off put it off to the sidehere's another bag so on and so forth soi'm thinking okaythat's fine until i start looking at thelettersmost if not all the letters that i wasshreddingwere in regards to those those checksthati had to take to the war room becausethey were morethan people were supposed to be able todonate they had me shredding evidencethat people had mailed checksat that point i realized quickly youknow whatit's always the little guy that getssent to leavenworthand i'm just saying they just assumethat i'm a stupid intern that's notgoing to knowthat i'm essentially being asked tocover upillegal activity that was the firstmomentthe very first moment the second waswhen donna brazilelet all of us interns people that werethat were basically working for freebecause we were college studentsthat we were that we were going to berequired to work 40 hours a week in theweeks leading up to the election or theywould not sign off on our hours forcollegei ended up being on school suspensionfor a year after that because my gradesfellthrough the floor because i had to skipclasses every day for like two weeksbecause of this so yeah no love lostespecially not now that she's on foxanyway skipping on aheadthat was when i learned studying to be amember of the news mediawe were trained to write articlesat an eighth grade understanding levelthat was my first time really realizingthat the news media assumes that thepeople that they're writing forhave a distinct lack of intelligencei knew my family members people thatthat were hardcore democratsthat deserve so much better than the waythey were treatedbut even then i still continue to votedemocrati voted democrat every election until2016.my husband and i have been married for12 yearshe he was with me i mean he had voteddemocratpretty much all his life up untilthe point that we moved back to texas myhusband is originally from texasand in 2010 my husband and i moved fromtennesseeall the way down to texas that was wherei first started to really get intopoliticsso we were kind of watching and i knewthat i didn't like hillary because ofhow badly she had treated the womenthat had accused her husband of sexualassault i'm not talking about monicai'm talking about the others the onethat trump had the ones that trump hadat that press conference right after theaccess hollywood tape came outso i knew that i couldn't vote for herbecause she used every ounce ofpolitical capital she had tobury those women and then had theaudacity to claimthat she and the democrats were theparty of womeni was like nowhen i was working for gore's campaign iwas very impressed with john mccainnot a popular opinion at the campaignheadquarters as you can imagineuntil he chose sarah palin for hisrunning mate and i knew the reason thathe chose her was because he was tryingto appeal to womenand that was the first time that i everthought i am not going to vote for youjust because you chose a woman to beyour running matei'm not going to vote for somebody justbecause she's a woman she has to bequalified she has to have views that iagree withso when hillary's entire campaigncentered around the fact that it washer turn andthat she just she gave off the air ofsomebody that just believed that it washer turnand i'm thinking to myself you're gonnahave to give me more thanjust the fact that i should vote to notbetray my gendersomething of course that i was toldafter the campaign and his electionso we were still living in texaspreparing to move back to tennessee whenthe primary happened in 2016.my husband voted for marco rubio i votedfor berniebecause i was still on the democrat sidebutknew that i couldn't stomach voting forher so i voted for himbecause i liked a lot of his ideashaving not really a lot of understandingabout how they would get paid for thatwas my firstmistake but anyway soafter the primary when trump got thenominationthat was when the media completely losttheir mindsbut i think the true moment when ifinally just saidyou know what never again was whenhillary came out and calledhalf of trump supporters she could putthem in a basket of deplorables and i'mthinking to myselflet's be real you don't mean half of usyou meanall of us all of us that didn't vote foryou all of us that disagree with youall of us in the flyover states one ofmyfavorite favorite videos to watch fromelection nightis the young turks becauseit's it epitomizes the disdainthat people havefor people that come from states likemineif you don't live on the coast or you'renot part of the coastal elites they haveno use for youat all i mean i watch the newsokay i'll give you a good examplesomething that i learned from fromstudying for my degree in journalismon inauguration daythey had well first they had thepicturesof the empty the emptyspaces where they claim that nobodyshowed up for the inauguration which iknew wasa load of crap because one of my localorganizations said that there werepeople turned away at the gate becausethere were so many people so i knewthat was a lie immediately but theni watched them disparage donaldfor when he and melania came down in thecarwhere they were supposed to meet withthe obamas for breakfastthey criticized donald for jumping outof the carand leaving melania behindbut the video that they shot cut off ata certain pointso i did some searching and i looked forthe video thatthe rest of it because i knew from theabruptness of the way they cut it offthat there was something we weren'tsupposed to seesure enough it's donald rushing aheadwhile the driver opens the door frommelaniaso that he can run up and open the doorfor the obamas in a sign of respectthey cut that part off of the video toshow that he's a misogynist that leaveshis wife behindhe's a racist two of his wives areimmigrants for god's sakeyou know i grew up around democrats ialways thought that the republicans werethe racistsuntil i learned after doing someresearch thatthe republican party was foundedto eliminate slavery that was thepurpose for the entire republican partybeing founded in the first placebut then i started getting argumentsfrom people that i worked with sayingyeah but that was so long ago and i'mlike well how about the voting rightsact of 64.is that close enough for you and theywere like what do you mean i saidthe democrats voted unanimously againstthathillary raised barry goldwaterand margaret sangeri can't begin to tell you how shocked iwas when i found the videoof her talking about eliminating thenumbers in the black communityand then i started to think all theplanned parenthoods in the areas where igrew upare in the poor areas why do we thinkthat isare we trying to get rid of people thatwe think are a drain on society are youkidding mebut sure i'm the racist are you kiddingso there's that there's the open disdainthat the entire democrat establishmenthas held and the mediawho i view is nothing more than a than abunch of propagandists for thedemocratic partyso these are just some of the many manymany reasonsthat i chose to walk away i went frombeingan absolute vehement liberal all my lifeto taking that red pillin the fall of 2016unless they fix the the links thatthey've fallen downi will never vote democrat again 2016was the first timethat i had ever voted straight party allthe way downbefore that i was a person that wouldvote for the person whether they wererepublican or democrat i kind of tendedto think of myself as a modderkind of a moderate i have familyfriends that have all turned their backson me because they think thati am against gay people because i votedfor donald trumpi believe that every person deserves theright to be happyand the right to have their voices heardin facton election night they scheduled me toclose at the store that i was working atwhen the return started to come in everyperson that i worked with at that storevoted democrat i was like maybe one ofmaybe threepeople that didn't i sat and held theirhands when they criedbecause i remember standing in thelegislative plaza in nashville when gorelostuntil two in the morning when he had hiscampaign manager come down to tell us togo homeyou can imagine when hillary didn'taddress her supporters after theelection i was like well that looksfamiliarstop showing disdain for the people thatthatgive their blood sweat and tears to youtrying to use every nasty trick that youcan pullto accomplish your goals stop clingingto power with withall your bony fingersyou have to recognize the people thatput you there in the first place and idon't think the democratic party at thispoint does thati have found so much love and acceptancein this groupwhen i found your video brandon it was alifesaverthank you so much hashtag walk away
hi my name is windy I'm doing this videoI already gave a testimonial written butI'm doing the video to show that I amNOT a bot anyways I was always adie-hard Democrat voting for almost twodecades hardcore Democratand never had a problem disputingpolitics with Republicans neverexperienced hate or anything like thatand then I voted for Obama definitely Imean who wouldn't if you're a Democratperfect candidate and an interestingthing happened I went back to school tostudy a different subject outside ofanimal science which led me to takeAmerican history classes and a lot ofconstitutional study classes where youlearn about the Constitution in thehistory of the Constitution and Istarted having thoughts that you knownow that I'm getting a betterunderstanding of the history and libertyand freedom and what it means that maybeI've been wrong all these years and so Ikind of delve into the whole politicalscene and got really involved in it andthen I started noticing something myRepublican friends on my facebook werevery thoughtful debaters never a harshword to me ever when I supported Obamaand liked what he was doing for acertain period of time but then Inoticed when I started speaking outagainst left-leaning ideology that Ikind of felt had changed since theKennedy Democrats I noticed that myliberal friends rather than engaging andthoughtful debate or using facts startedcalling me names I mean I don't evenknow if I should say what names they'recalling me but one particular comes tomind where someone who is raised in theexact circumstances is mean not that faraway from me growing up called me adick-sucker racist bigoted hillbilly andwatch go suck someor caulk I mean come on I mean howmisogynist is that anyways to start withbut anyways one night like I said I'dfor a couple years now they I have beenresearching politics one night at dawnedon me that I am NOT a Republican I meanI am NOT a Democrat I am a Republicanand I aligned with Republican ideologyand I cried all night long to my husbandadmitting to the horrible mistake that Ihad meet I felt like I really betrayedmy country voting Democrat for all thoseyears and here I stand I was not a trumpsupporter I campaigned against him I wasa Carson fan and now with Trump beingpresident absolutely I support him wantthe best for our country just like I'vesupported every other President of theUnited States of America and I reallywant Trump to do well and I really likewhat he's done so far I don'tparticularly like his tact I think helacks that a bit but as far as policy Ilike it I agree and I really hope thathe wins the second term I'm inCalifornia so it's kind of normal that Iwas Democrat for so long but I am NOT abot I was a lifelong Democrat who walkedaway from the party because I reallyfelt like one had taken a radical turnleft very radical and that was I startedrealizing that about 2009 after I hadalready voted for Obama and so that'sthat's where I'm athi my name is windy I'm

my name is Mike I was a huge Obamasupporter in 2008 along with my husbandyou know we were very excited when whenhe was elected and after about a year ortwo of his presidency at this point Ireally had nothing to do with him but Iwas doing a lot of research Monsanto andGMO and throughout that research I foundout that Obama had appointed MichaelTaylor to the FDA and that's what Iwould kinda consider when I swallowedthe red pill I love that analogy by theway I know it's everyone's using it butI just love it so after that happened Istarted doing doing more research on myown and digging deeper and deeper downthat rabbit hole come 2012 I had alreadymade the decision that I wasn't gonnavote for Obama again and so I startedresearching other candidates and I cameacross Ron Paul and his message ofindividual freedom and liberty reallyresonated with me so I picked up hisbooks and I read his books I startedpaying attention to what he was sayingand it was kind of amazing because whenI would hang out with friends or familyat that point I would kind of bring RonPaul up and not all the time but a lotof the time the first words out of theirmouth were the same words were hearingnow the same rather rhetoric we hear nowoh that guy's a racist that guy's ahomophobe that guy's a bigot and it kindof threw me back becauseI have been paying attention to whatthis guy was saying and I and and and Ihad read his books and I were and Ithought to myself he's me he's none ofthose things and another big thing to mein 2012 was gay marriage and of course Ilooked into Ron Paul's stance on gaymarriage the end his stance was that thegovernment shouldn't even be a marriageand that that blew my mind I had nevereven considered thinking of it that waybefore and and that's that's really whenyou can say that that the red pill tookeffect and I haven't looked backso by 2016 there's not a whole lot I gotto say about the last election besides Ihad already made the decision to walkaway from from the Democratic Party youknow one thing that really sticks outfor me it was the Berkeley riots whichyou know they downplayed his protestsbut but we all know that they were theywere riots and and the home of freespeech Berkeley the home of free speechand they're they're rioting because theydon't want somebody to speakthat was the nail in the coffin and ifthere wasn't already a nail in thecoffin for me and the Democratic Partyof course I looked up my lowly innopolisand I started listening to what he hadto say and Milo's Milo but but hedefinitely wasn't the monster that theyportrayed him to be sowhat I what I what I really want to sayis the beauty I'm finding in thismovement is it's it's not necessarilythat you have to jump on the Trump trainI fully respect you if you do I love itif you do that's that's your choicemy husband supported Trump but but whatreally what really gets to me is is Ithink the message is about seeingunderstanding and walking away from thetoxicity that the Democratic Party hasbecome you know now is the time to standup against the mob and that that hivementality will only last so long beforeit collapses and you to self -

if i couldbring some sense into some people i'vebeen uh i've beeni've been living in the bronx for halfof my life i was born in puerto ricoand i came here uh i was raised back andforth i used to live in puerto rico cometo new york i wouldn't even lived inchicago for a little bitand my deals has always been democratthey're brew and i recentlystarted moving more to the right and forthe reason isthat uh i see there's a lot of uhtoxic negativity going on in thedemocratic partyand in the liberal side everythingbothers them they want to abolisheverything everything willeverything is racist and they don'treally see what it's straight they don'treally think straightand why i say that is that all thisthing going on right nowwith the police uh one of the phonepoliceaccusing every white men of being racistaccusing everybody you know it's just awhole bunch of nonsense that to mereally needs to be addressed and reallyneeds to be we need to sit down and talkabout this asa country because i see this countrygoing down the hilland it's particularly the democraticparty that is pushing for thisand accusing trump of being the one thatuh is actuallydestroying the country when it'sactually dumb pushing to destroy thiscountryand it's and it's crazy it's likeeverything they they dothey actually do and everything thatthey actually push for and everythingthey always blame the other side ofbeing the ones doing it when it's donethat's doing it it's like it's crazyand for example they like to accusetrump of being a pedophile or rapistwhen it's the democratic party inparticularthis bit mostly there's mostly evidenceof thatand also the uh election meddlingthere's anelection fraud they always accuse thethe republicans of being the ones doingit when it's dumb there's more evidenceout there that theyactually are the ones that always dothis fraudsin elections and it's just reallygettingout of hand are we after me as a puertorican i had to sit down and think aboutthis becausewe are black and we

wehave the best constitutioncreated by man now are we gonna sit hereand blameour founding fathers for what thethey didhundreds of years ago it doesn't makeany sense to meit's like if i want to destroy

how canthese people that think that you'resmartthey're actually some academics thinkthis wayit's just doesn't i you know i don't getit through my head how can you be sodumb and so ignorant and so missed infourare we gonna go down the road destroyingthis country just because we're fightinga ghostliterally we're fighting ghosts thisdoesn't make any sense to me it's justcrazyi hear my family hear my friends andhear people that i know for so longtalk like this it just it's mind-blowingit's just how the hell do you even fighta ghosthow you fight things that happenedhundreds of years ago that

catch afit over something that doesn't make anydoesn't really affect you literally it'slike so many ignorant people nowadaysis crazy and that's why i had to moveaway from the leftbecause the life is toxic it's poisonedto your soul it's poisoned to your brainyou really people when you really needto think this throughwe have the greatest country we havemoved past a lot of issuesthere's always gonna be problems in oursystemcops are not all racist i seelisten when i used to live in the southbronx i still live in the bronx but nowi live more in the north sidebut when i used to live in the southbronx by 138 in brook avenuethere was an officer called ramirez hewas a puerto rican officerhe used to abuse everybody everybodyused to be scared of thishe used to abuse particularly the puertoricans that's the crazy parti've seen black officers kill blackpeople i've seen why officers kill whitepeoplei see indian officers kill people ofcolorit doesn't matter p the problem withthis country isthat police got too much immunitythey'll abuse their powerand since they know they could get awaywith it most of the timethey use it and abuse it that's theproblem with this with the situationright here right nownot that the old cops are racist not theold white people are racistwe have a problem with this country thatpolice think that they could get awaywith anythingthat's the problem and we that's what weneed to addressnot accuse everybody not not go crazynot catch a fitnot just by destroying the country weneed to address the problemfrom its roots if we don't really facethe problemof what it is we're not going to fix itwe're going to continueescalating problem after problem becausewe're notgoing to the root of the issue andthat's what i wanted to saythank you so much for listening to myvideo take care peace out
how's it going everybody Zack here andI'm back with a video for you todaytoday is actually a great day to be ableto make this video because I only justdiscovered that this was actually amovement that I was not the only personthat felt this way for such a long timeas you probably have figured it out bythe title of this video this is going tobe my walk away story about how I wasraised conservative and then I became aDemocratic Party supporter and a liberalsocial justice warrior as its evidencedin my previous video and I want to talka little bit of a my journey kind ofjust transitioning away from that andwhy I decided to walk away fromliberalism and the Democratic Party umit's just amazing first of all toactually feel like I'm not the only onewho feels this way and even though itmay not be evident there's probably alot of people who also feel this way andthe fact that this is actually a thingis pretty crazy because I've beenfeeling this way for months you know upuntil maybe about eight nine or tenmonths ago I'd say this year in general2018 probably the end of 2017 I had abit of a red pill moment and I just kindof went into the details and I was Ithink what started it all was the Mileyinnopolis protests at Berkeley and thatwas in basically my neighborhoodBerkeley just down the street it's atown that's close to Oakland and it mademe investigate that a little bit and asprobably a lot of other people who areembracing you know a different idea nowwhether it's more conservative oranything which is where I'm at now ismore of a conservative standpoint itmade me kind of just really really takea look as to why this guy is generatingso much controversy and I really reallylistened to what he had to say and ofcourse with that I discovered otherpeople like ben shapiro and dave rubinand a lot of other folks but I didn'tget there because I was just looking onthe Internetover time I had felt prettydisenfranchised with the DemocraticParty and that there were a lot ofpromises to help minority ISM to helpfight racism and everything yetnothing's been done in the past fewyears you know I had voted for Hillaryin the 2016 election and had seen andthat was kind of Reich right around theend when I was a social justice warriorI have just finished college and wasthinking about that but then I startedto investigate it furtherone of the biggest defining factors wasben shapiro there was there's a videoonline of ben and how he talks aboutpro-choice i believe it's eitherpro-choice or abortion and I had beenraised conservative and after havinglooked into abortion and just what it'sabout I realized that it's somethingthat i morally cannot support it's justthere's a part of me that after seeinghow horrific it is no part of meactually agrees with that so I startedinvestigating it further looking intoreally really researching what the factswereand eventually I found out that this iswhat the truth isokay I'm liberalism on college campusesand social justice has basically put theblame on everybody else and the thing isof course I mean that's how you wouldfeel if you're a minority in America isyou're gonna want to hear that and goyeah my struggle I am oppressed becauseof somebody else when in reality that'snot the case in a land like America in acountry like America you can make itwhat you want for yourself and if you'rea US citizen you have the ticket tobasically creating the life that youwant to create and foster your ownbeliefs but unfortunately um it justmade no sense anymore you know I startedlistening to arguments surrounding thirdwave feminism and I actually go intothis in my other video about why I whenI talked about social justice and thatis just there's so much intolerancebelligerence with people and especiallyin a place like the San Francisco Bayit's just that's all you hear is justpeople protesting about what and notreally really making any chainin their own lives and I mean mythoughts are not very structured in thisvideo but it this video that I'm makingabout my walk away is exactly why I'm nolonger social justice warrior it's alsowhy I decided to leave the left and I'min pursuit of facts not feelings factsare what get things done at the end ofthe day and it's not about the feelingsand it's also when I started to learn alittle bit more about the history of theDemocratic Party about how the originalKKK were all Democrats or the fact thatum originally the Democrats were broughtinto play is to keep poor people pooryou know and as long as they had yourvote you could keep them in office and Istarted investigating it further andthen I just felt disenfranchised youknow all of this happened at the sametime as me kind of becoming red pillaware which is another thing but it wasabout taking the facts of the world andevaluating on what you believe is rightand to be honest I made that socialjustice video about what I used to beone before I realized that this walkawaything was an actual thing and this isamazing because now there's thousands ofor perhaps even millions of Americansyoung people like myself who used to bedemocratic who used to believe inliberalism and no longer want toassociate with that because it's nothingbut a movement of hate about blaming thepatriarchy for all your problems nottaking responsibility for yourself thatyou know as long as you just listen aslong if you don't agree with what I haveto say and then you're automatically aracist or you're automatically ahomophobe and I just want nothing to dowith it anymore it's just about that'sessentially it you know and it's allbased in the facts the facts or what isgoing to affect change and createlong-lasting progress in America and notfeelings that's really the bottom lineis it comes down to facts you govern acountry based on the facts not on thebiases and the prejudices of its peopleso that's my story that's my walkawaystory I just want to kick out a quickvideo for you guys todaylet me know what you think of this videoand what your story is and yeah my nameis Zack I come out with videos every daydo hit that subscribe button if you likewhat you see I'll link the video to mywhy I used to be a

help minority ISM to helpfight racism and everything yetnothing's been done in the past fewyears you know I had voted for Hillaryin the 2016 election and had seen andthat was kind of Reich right around theend when I was a social justice warriorI have just finished college and wasthinking about that but then I startedto investigate it furtherone of the biggest defining factors wasben shapiro there was there's a videoonline of ben and how he talks aboutpro-choice i believe it's eitherpro-choice or abortion and I had beenraised conservative and after havinglooked into abortion and just what it'sabout I realized that it's somethingthat i morally cannot support it's justthere's a part of me that after seeinghow horrific it is no part of meactually agrees with that so I startedinvestigating it further looking intoreally really researching what the factswereand eventually I found out that this iswhat the truth isokay I'm liberalism on college campusesand social justice has basically put theblame on everybody else and the thing isof course I mean that's how you wouldfeel if you're a minority in America isyou're gonna want to hear that and goyeah my struggle I am oppressed becauseof somebody else when in reality that'snot the case in a land like America in acountry like America you can make itwhat you want for yourself and if you'rea US citizen you have the ticket tobasically creating the life that youwant to create and foster your ownbeliefs but unfortunately um it justmade no sense anymore you know I startedlistening to arguments surrounding thirdwave feminism and I actually go intothis in my other video about why I whenI talked about social justice and thatis just there's so much intolerancebelligerence with people and especiallyin a place like the San Francisco Bayit's just that's all you hear is justpeople protesting about what and notreally really making any chainin their own lives and I mean mythoughts are not very structured in thisvideo but it this video that I'm makingabout my walk away is exactly why I'm nolonger social justice warrior it's alsowhy I decided to leave the left and I'min pursuit of facts not feelings factsare what get things done at the end ofthe day and it's not about the feelingsand it's also when I started to learn alittle bit more about the history of theDemocratic Party about how the originalKKK were all Democrats or the fact thatum originally the Democrats were broughtinto play is to keep poor people pooryou know and as long as they had yourvote you could keep them in office and Istarted investigating it further andthen I just felt disenfranchised youknow all of this happened at the sametime as me kind of becoming red pillaware which is another thing but it wasabout taking the facts of the world andevaluating on what you believe is rightand to be honest I made that socialjustice video about what I used to beone before I realized that this walkawaything was an actual thing and this isamazing because now there's thousands ofor perhaps even millions of Americansyoung people like myself who used to bedemocratic who used to believe inliberalism and no longer want toassociate with that because it's nothingbut a movement of hate about blaming thepatriarchy for all your problems nottaking responsibility for yourself thatyou know as long as you just listen aslong if you don't agree with what I haveto say and then you're automatically aracist or you're automatically ahomophobe and I just want nothing to dowith it anymore it's just about that'sessentially it you know and it's allbased in the facts the facts or what isgoing to affect change and createlong-lasting progress in America and notfeelings that's really the bottom lineis it comes down to facts you govern acountry based on the facts not on thebiases and the prejudices of its peopleso that's my story that's my walkawaystory I just want to kick out a quickvideo for you guys todaylet me know what you think of this videoand what your story is and yeah my nameis Zack I come out with videos every daydo hit that subscribe button if you likewhat you see I'll link the video to mywhy I used to be a social justicewarrior down below so you can watch thatas well I go into a little bit moredetails as to why thank you so much foryour time and I will see you in the nextvideoyouhow's it going everybody Zack here andI'm back with a video for you todaytoday is actually a great day to be ableto make this video because I only justdiscovered that this was actually amovement that I was not the only personthat felt this way for such a long timeas you probably have figured it out bythe title of this video this is going tobe my walk away story about how I wasraised conservative and then I became aDemocratic Party supporter and a liberalsocial justice warrior as its evidencedin my previous video and I want to talka little bit of a my journey kind ofjust transitioning away from that andwhy I decided to walk away fromliberalism and the Democratic Party umit's just amazing first of all toactually feel like I'm not the only onewho feels this way and even though itmay not be evident there's probably alot of people who also feel this way andthe fact that this is actually a thingis pretty crazy because I've beenfeeling this way for months you know upuntil maybe about eight nine or tenmonths ago I'd say this year in general2018 probably the end of 2017 I had abit of a red pill moment and I just kindof went into the details and I was Ithink what started it all was the Mileyinnopolis protests at Berkeley and thatwas in basically my neighborhoodBerkeley just down the street it's atown that's close to Oakland and it mademe investigate that a little bit and asprobably a lot of other people who areembracing you know a different idea nowwhether it's more conservative oranything which is where I'm at now ismore of a conservative standpoint itmade me kind of just really really takea look as to why this guy is generatingso much controversy and I really reallylistened to what he had to say and ofcourse with that I discovered otherpeople like ben shapiro and dave rubinand a lot of other folks but I didn'tget

so today i was toldthat i need to go myself because ofwho i supporti've been a democrat at hearts way i wasraisedthey were for equality gay rights blackrights doesn't matter who you arethey're for equalityit's the way i was raisedi've been against president trump sincehe was electedup until this year i finally stopped anddid research of my ownfound out everything that i was toldthat he's a racist a liar everythingelsewas just to make me hate him i haven'tseen any evidence of itnever have and never willbut today when my so-called party thati'm part ofsays that peaceful protesting involvesburning down buildings looting storesruining other people's lives that to meis not peaceful protesting and that'swhat made me walk awayfrom the democratic partytonight i was told by one of my liberalfriendsto go myself because i supporttrump for 2020.it's funny though growing up democratyou're taughtlove everybody respect everybodyeverybody has their right to do whatthey wishbut when it comes down to it you startviewing things differently than they doall of a sudden that policy goes rightout the windowdo i support trump for 2020 yes i dodo i support the democratic party in thefuture most likely notthis year i have walked awayi have lost a lot of friends actuallyover the last couple weeks especiallyall because of who i supportmyself i am a gay manand i've been called a right-wingedtraitor because i support trumpand became a republican this yeari just don't get howpeople who preach nothing but peace andkindness and love for everybody can beso hateful but in turncall us hateful because of our supportfor trumpwho's supposed to be this big racistsexistbigot and you know what i believedeverything the media said about thatup until this year when i finallystarted realizing stuffhey was it from trump's side of theracistsexist bigotry it was the democraticsidethat i've seen to itand i've lost a lot of friends this yearbecause of my support for trump andwalking away from the democratic partyjust hope in the future i can make somenew ones that actuallyeither support the same views i have ordoesn't matter to them what views i havehashtag walk away 20 20.have a good day
so I I had not been paying muchattention to the quote walkaway movementyou're all familiar with hashtagwalkawayso I read a little bit about thethinking behind it and I was wonderingwhat policy is it in particular is is itbecause you know my assumption which wasincorrect my assumption was that maybeit's policy related or maybe it's youknow they just prefer the Republicanpolicies after all or maybe it's they'rejust saying that the president is beingeffective in a general way that's what Ithought before I read the details oh ohmy viewers this is way more interestingon that I don't know if you quite caughtit but let me put it in context I liketo talk about the most you know how Italk about the persuasion filter it's away of looking at the world as ifeverything is persuasion and the factsand reason are things we pretend we careabout but sort of don't and I've alsosaid that President Trump and I saidthis I know two years ago would quotepunch a hole in the universe or or put atear in the universe so that you couldlook through the hole and see realityfor the first time because we all walkaround in this little little bubblemovie of our own making and I said thathe's gonna let you see reality at leasta little bit of it not all of it cuzwe're not we're not able but he wouldput a hole in your current bubble so youcould just peek out and see what's onthe other side and you'd say holy capI'm in a bubble so really the mostyou're gonna get out of this is theknowledge certain that you've beenliving in a bubble of truth that youcreated in your own head as opposed totruth that exists at the universe andapparently that's what happened toBrendon Straka because here's how hedescribes his thinking behind the walkawaywas it about policy here's what it wasabout he realized that the Democratswere using fear to manipulate peoplethat's a big dealthat's a big deal that's peeking throughthe hole in the universeit wasn't about policies wasn't aboutout you know which leaders a little moreeffective was it about who cares aboutyou wasn't about who's got the bestplans for the future he realized thatone side was manipulating them with fearand that that's all that was going onwell that's not all this going on butthat was the big picture the big picturewas persuasion that was fear-based andthe fear wasn't real now you're sayingto yourselfTrump uses fear to manipulate you tohere's the difference the fear thatTrump uses and and he does use the fearto manipulate he's talking about fear ofpeople outside the country in many caseswho have actually killed lots of peoplelike Isis and terrorists so when he'stough on the border he's pointing toms-13 who are real people ms-13 actuallykills people and apparently we're onlyjust learning that the althoughimmigrants as a group have an unusuallylow crime rate yeah immigrants a veryPro immigrant low crime rate greataddition to the country but among theclass of illegal ones were breaking thelaw to get in it turns out that the rateof murder and violent crime and stuff isis far higher than their percentage inthe population so they are literally ahigh crime group just the illegalimmigrants in general awesome peoplecontributing to the countrylower cried in the normal lower crimethan average so Trump's fear is based onpeople who really exist and really arehurting people those are things youactually should be worried about Trump'sfear would be you know you could arguethat he's scared everybody with NorthKorea but that's a real fear and he gota pretty good result there or at leastit seems to add in the right directionso but if you look at now look at theDemocrats version of fear their fear isof your fellow citizen is that a sexistterm can you say that anymore can yousay your fellow citizen is that sexistwhat's what's the generic ways that yourother citizens your teammates your yourcountry people comrade citizen somebodysays so notice the huge difference thereso Brendon Straka has realized that theDemocrats are creating fear of eachotherTrump is creating fear almost entirely Ican't think of an example of people whoare outside our borders who areliterally armed and dangerous peoplewith actual guns and weapons who areactually using them it's a little bitdifferent right there's one thing youshould be afraid of and there's onething that's largely invented and enoughtime has now passed so that anyreasonable citizen can see that thethings that people said about Trump wereclearly untrue that there was a fearthat he would tank the economy not truethere was a fear that you would blow upthe world with nuclear weapons and neverget anywhere with North Korea cuz he's ahe was a crazy man he's crazier than kimjungeun and not true and you know whatit wasn't even true that kim jungeun iscrazy andanyway that matters for negotiatingnegotiated what else is oh there was afear that you would he would round upgay people and you know put them incamps obviously not true there was afear that you know he would do this orthat anyway so it's becoming more andmore clear to the people on the leftthat they've been taken by their ownside that they're their own side isusing fear of their of their own countrypeople I don't want to say countrymenyou know you realize how sexist all ofour old terms are but that is a powerfulit's a very powerful thought and if thiswalk away thing had been you know basedon oh I think I've changed my mind and Ilike the Republican policies better I'dsay to myselfyeah that's not much you know a fewpeople will change change partiesbecause the policy is no big dealbut when people are talking aboutchanging parties because they realizedthat they're being taken that they'rejust being taken manipulated by fear andthat they're let me let me put this inperspective I imagine if you will thatall of the coverage of this Presidenthad been just straight objectivecoverage that then nobody ever gave anopinion of what they thought he would door what they thought he was thinkingwhat if the only coverage you'd seen hadbeen coverage of Trump as a person whodoes stuff and you just observe what hedoes you know compared to maybe what hepromised and say yeah yeah he's he'sdoing the things that we got elected foretc here's what people think of ithere's what they don't you know the butbut if the news had notbecome let's say participants in thepolitical process had they moved hadthey not moved from an observer watchdogrole to actual participants they'retrying to to you know move the needlewould the left be afraid of thispresident a little maybe just becauseyou know it's a big country and a lot ofdifferent opinions a lot of differentindividuals but probably nothing likewe're seeing I would argue that close toa hundred percent of the fear thatpeople have about this president isbased on you know non objective coveragewould you say that's true would youagree with me that almost a hundredpercent of the fear the the I'm talkingabout the irrational fear the the thingthat makes people vomit and and shakebecause that's what people areexperiencing right you know joke all youwill about you know the the leftyou know howling at the moon and stufflike that but this is a real medicalproblem they're they've lived for 18months in in total fear where is thatfear coming from well they've beenmanipulated into believing it's comingfrom the president that it's because ofthe things he's doing the things he'sthinking which is crazybecause they don't know what he thinksand the things that in their imaginationhe might do those things all come fromthe press you know in the the opinionpart of the press mostly that's notcoming from the president what has thepresident said recently that would scarea citizen of the United States now I dothink there's a role of the press andthat the public opinion and everythinghas changed this president's policypreferences so for example when he wascampaigning he was talking aboutdeporting 14 million people who are hereundocumented but otherwisegood citizens and of course he's notdoing that it doesn't look like there'sanything any real chance of thathappening so there are some big thingsthat we see the public pretty muchimmediately causes president to changeopinions take the children in cages forexample you know the public had its sayand it looked like a public had his sayand he changed now somebody saying whatabout the repeal of Roe versus Wadewe'll talk about that in a minute anywayso my point is that this Brandon Strakawhat he's doing is far more importantthan I imagined when I was just readingthe headline about it and I didn't readthe detail once you see his reason thathe realized that Democrats aremanipulating people into this permanentunhealthy unhealthy unhealthy very veryphysically and mentally unhealthy have Imentioned unhealthy state so theDemocrats for their their political fortheir political benefit have caused theentire left to be in physical

this if you want to getmad you know you probably won't get asmad the people who are watching thisperiscope but if you are on the Left letme ask you this do you believe thatChuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are asafraid for the future as they have madeyou feel let that just hang there for aminute if you're a Democrat do you thinkthat Schumer and Pelosi are as afraidabout what might happen with thispresident with the country as they havemade you the voter feel not a chance noteven a slight chance and you know whatyou could tell you could tell just bylooking at them have you ever seen

well as a friend of mine once said onceupon a time I was a liberal I'm notquite as good at the smoldery blue-steelsort of stares Brandon is but I'll do mybestwe are raised to be leftist we areraised to be loyal soldiers to theDemocratic Party even when I was in highschool but in public school the historyteacher took the class on an illegaltrip to Cuba to teach about the joys ofsocialism and when they asked him why hewas like oh well I'm a communist youknow of course um you know this schoolthey had no debate Club no civics clubbut there was communism club so you knowit is just impounded in our heads at anearly age I had always been a liberalbut I never really bought into thiswhole collective [ __ ] I was always arebel I was always different even interms of being gay I never felt acceptedby the gay community I never felt like Iwas part of them I always felt judgedand they're mainly all about groupthinkand conformity and looking speakingacting thinking exactly as they do andthat was just never what I was aboutso I guess my red pill story is a littlebit darker than some people's so I guessI'll just say that in summer of 2012 Ihad a home invasion sort of thing and Iwas raped sorry there's weird to talkabout so openlyyou know without going into all thedetails I guess I was living in anapartment in Brooklyn with like fiveroommates and you know they were allleftist activists and all into drugs andone guy who was my roommate at the timewas very closeted and so you know theymoved out and I guess he kept his keysyou know I was there alone five in themorning you know but anyway the point isat the time all of my friends wereradical leftists you know male feministsocial justice warriors rape activiststhe works those are favorite words allthey ever talked about rape rape cultureI hate the term by the way so I reallythought that going to these people likewow they're experts in rape they youknow it's all they talk about that Ireally thought they would support me andhave my back and help me seek justiceand all that that wasn't quite thereception II learned very quickly that when thishappens to a guy nobody wants to hearabout it nobody will let you talk aboutit nobody cares I would try and talkabout I needed to talk about it you knowwith my friends and nobody cared theywould smile nod and immediately changethe subject yet then every moment ofevery day I would be told by them wellimagine how women feel and women have itworse and you know these women theycan't walk down the street without beingraped and you know oh these women theyget raped and it ruins their lives andwomen women when you know it's as ifthey were telling me to just shut upbecause women have it worse I justcouldn't believe the hypocrisy of thesepeople at this time - it was all in thenews about comedians and rape jokes andwanting to ban that so these same peoplethen everyday we're just talking abouthow you know they're protesting somecomedian and rape jokes and rape isnever funny rape is never funny and Ijust thought to myself in that moment Iwas like you know I don't know how Idon't know when but someday I'm gonnafind a way to laugh about what happenedto me just to spite them so it is thistime to that I noticed how politicallycorrect everyone was becoming that youcould not say a word without beingcalled some sort of name this one time Ihad gone on a really awkward date withthis guy where he asked if he could kissme um so when I like told friends aboutthis I wrote a post that you know it'svery unattractive when someone asks tokiss you these same people then jumpdown my throat you're a sexist and youneed affirmative consent and you'readvocating rape you're a rape apologistyou know knowing what I had just gonethrough so this is how they treat peoplethat they claim to champion you know butanyway there were a couple of instancesthat led to my red pill hang so if thatwas the first one the second was thisnow after this happened obviously I hadto get out of that apartment I couldn'tbe there but it was the middle of themonth I know where to go I had no moneyI couldn't find an apartment so I endedup calling some room rental servicewhere you can just move in that day sothey said they had a place super cheapLower East Side in Manhattan greatneighborhood I was like perfect I'lltake it so I show up there with mythingsit's in the projects I lived in theprojects for about a month and a halfnow let me tell you something you cannotlive in the projects for any amount oftime and come out of there illiberalit's not possible I think I was veryignorant as to just how dangerous it wasyou know in retrospect I really don'tknow how I survived especially lookinglike an emaciated albino alien vampirelike I do but I think people don'trealize just how bad the situation is inplaces like that it's bad the peoplethere are so dangerous you knowassaulting people mugging people there'spiss and [ __ ] everywhere and you knowneedles hanging out of their arms andthose are the good ones you know soanyway the woman who I was renting theroom in her apartment she was 26 yearsold for kids from four different fathersmost of them incarcerated and you knowwhen I asked her what do you do she saidI'm in the system as her parents were asher kids will be you know that's thesituation when you are put on welfareyou are meant to stay there so you knowand she would tell me about how like thebuzzwords she would use to get moremoney and if you have more kids you getmore money and you know meanwhile everyday she would come home with shoppingbags of like X boxes and iPads and herTV went from like the floor to theceilingthe thing is though you cannot cannotcannot blame these people they havenever known anything else that you areborn into the system you know whatDemocrats do is that they basically getpeople hooked on drugs the drug of freemoney you know and then they say that ifyou want your fix you have to keepvoting for us I've seen firsthand thedestruction caused by these Democratpolicies and it's bad um you know it'svery frustrating trying to discuss thissubject with liberals about the welfarestate because they are coming from aplace that is theoretical that they'veheard about in a classroom I've livedthis and people do not realize just howtoxic it is and how generational it isand how people are just beingset up for failure it's bad so anyway Ieventually clawed my way out of there Ifound my own place and now I had to dealwith all of these things that hadhappened um you know I'm not gonna lieit was difficult for a long time Ireally struggled and you know I had alot of depression and it was sort of youknow almost like suicidal for a whileyou know I still have a scar on my handfrom all the nights I went to sleepclutching a knife yes I know what you'rethinking yes it changed my views on theSecond Amendment but you know I gotbetter I had to put the work in to bementally well and be healthy and youknow that's my responsibility I'm not avictim with these left it's as if theyencourage emotional instability theywant you to just do in your victimhoodand you can't do that you know we can'thelp the cards were dealt in life wecan't help the things that happen to usbut whether you're a victim or asurvivor is how you handle it is how youplay those cards is what happens after Ieventually got through it and found mystrength and you know and the thing isthe thing that made me feel betterthroughout this time were offensiveoff-color rape jokes I would seek outevery one I could find every comedianand it is the only thing that like gotme over it and these are the things theywant to ban so anyway these things sortof stayed in the back of my mind but Inever really connected the dots betweenthem so a couple of years went by andnow trigger warnings were everywhere youcould not read a news article without atrigger warning especially on thissubject so you know I'd put in all thiswork to be strong and be healthy and bewell-adjusted and now I was being toldthat I'm some sort of victim who is toofragile and too damaged to even read anews article without a warningso anyway I'm a writer so I had a blogat the time that was basically likeshort stories funny things from my lifeand I decided to write a blog about thiswhole experience you know because Iwanted to show a few things I wanted toshow that this happens to men it happensto way more guys than anyone realizes itjust isn't talked about there isn't thesame level of education you know and Ialso want to give a perspective ofstrength and hueand not victimhood you know I wanted toshow that people who have been throughthings like this in their life are toughstrong resilient people we are not thesefragile mentally ill china dolls thatthey'll have you believe and I also wantto call out the hypocrisy of theseactivists so I wrote this blog andwithin 48 hours I had hundreds ofmessages from angry leftists and socialjustice warriors calling me every namein the world you know how dare you writethis how dare you say you're not avictim women have it worse you know howdare you call out these activists whenyou should be thanking them thankingthem that's funny you know telling meI'm making it up my favorite thing thatthey said was that simply by talkingabout how I fought back against myattacker that I am marginalizing andvictimizing anyone who didn't first ofall where do they all learn to talk thesame no they all say the same buzzwordsso according to them I have no ownershipover my life and my story to even talkabout it and this really showed me howliberals treat the people they claim tochampion when one says something thatthey don't want to hear these peoplethey didn't like how I was talking aboutit they want their victims to be cryingand quivering and shaking in a cornerand dependent on them and I was somebodywho's standing tall not crying andsaying I don't need you to triggerwarnings so the thing is if the thingsthat had happened years prior were setoff the little spark in my mind this wasthe tank of gasoline on top of thatbecause this happened right as theelection was heating up it was likeearly 2016 so I'd always been veryinvolved in politics I went to Iowa tocampaign for Obama in 2008 I voted forhim three times all my family areDemocrats so initially I was like okayI'll be for Bernie but then I startedresearching things and realizing waitthis doesn't add up none of this makessense I you know I voted for him veryhalf-heartedly because I didn't knowwhat else to doand then I was like okay I'll be forHillary and then I fell down the rabbithole of research and I found out thehistory of the Democraticand I found out things that I had noclue were going on all this time youknow I've been in a bubble for years ofjust watching MSNBC all day and I wasfinding out things that I had no cluewere happening I didn't know that Obamatook us from two wars to seven wars Ididn't know that his cabinet washandpicked by Citigroup I didn't knowall of these things about the ClintonFoundation all the things with foreigngovernments in Saudi Arabia Morocco andlike all of the corruption all thethings have been going on for so longand we're continuing to go on and thething is all of these things that I wasnow learning were in such contrast towhat I was hearing in the media and fromfriends and people saying oh you justhate her because she's a womanyou know when no that was literally theonly reason I even considered voting forher if you put a moment of thought intoall of the things and think about whatDemocrats ever done for the people ifthey claimed to champion you know evenevery ounce of gay rights that has beenmade the past decade has simply beenundoing Bill Clinton's policies myparents are both cancer survivors andthe cost of their health insurancedoubled and tripled under Obama carethey really got screwed by it but it'sas if it never even occurred to any ofus you don't have to vote Democrat it isso programmed into you from schoolonwards that there are basically twoidentities that you can have in lifeyou're one or the other Democrat or Naziand that doesn't work for me my entirelife I was led to believe that ifsomebody isn't a leftist and isn't aDemocrat that they are just a homophobicracist sexist Nazi and I always believedthat because I had never met anybody inNew York who wasn't a Democrat butduring that summer of 2016I started making new friends and Istarted meeting all of these people whowere conservatives and libertarians andTrump supporters and Republicans and Irealized that they are nothing of thesort that we have most things in commoneven where we disagree and person afterperson that I would meet honestly showedme more kindness and more acceptancethan these liberals ever did andcertainly more than the gay communityever did and it really showed me howwrong these narratives are that areimpounded into our heads so you knowlong story short or not short but longstory long asorry you guys for rambling so um but umanyway I left the Democratic Party and Ibecame very outspoken against the leftbecause I think that these are toxic badregressive ideas that are bringing usbackwards and making every group hateeach other and they need to be activelyfought against especially when you thinkabout how much power they have theycontrol every cultural institution soanyway in doing so I lost all my friendsI lost probably about 90% of my friendsfor me at least it was a thousand timesharder coming out as a centrist againstthe left than it was coming out as gayyou know and then I found people likeDave Rubin and christina hoff sommerspeople who were finally saying thethings that I had been feeling for yearsbut just didn't have the language to beable to identify them as regressiveleftist and that's what they are thething is what Democrats do that is sogenius but so evil is that they fusetheir partisan policies together withpeople's identities so if you don't wantthe Christian Baker to be forced to bakethe gay wedding cakeyou just take gay people if you opposeyou know things like illegal immigrationor the welfare state or whatever youjust hate black people if you don't voteHillary you just hate women and this ishow they are able to control people byinstilling fear if you don't go along ifyou ask questions if you don't justagree with them then you will be thesenames they call you and what I wouldreally say to anybody who is like-mindedthat's afraid to speak out is toremember one thing there's no such thingas an insult something is either true orit is not true so it doesn't matter whatthey call you because a lot of peopleare afraid of being called all thesethings I've been called every name youcan imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jewrape sir for all these things thatthey're supposed to stand for me I'msupposed to be I should have property ofthe DNCtattooed on my ass but you see how theytreat anybody who asks questions anybodywho challenges their dogma it is areligion and what I would really say toanybody who still supports this is whereare things better where is one thingwhere we're better off where is one insince where people are more unified orget along better or anything of the sortI only see negative things what good isthis doing who is this helping and ifnothing maybe it's time to walk away andtry something else so in conclusion Iwould just like to say that I think onething that's really important for us whohave walked away from the left is for usto not then take on the qualities thatwe walked away from to not buy intogroupthink and tribalism I think it isincumbent on all of us to improve theright and it improved the RepublicanParty and take back the center so anywaythank you guys so much for listening andsorry for my long ramblings but anywayyou know as a Russian bot in conclusionI will just saydosvedanya hey guys just wanted to addthis as a PS as I said I'm a writer andI've created a TV show that is basicallya walk away perspective of being gay andsingle and it's a very critical look atthis conformist post modernist gaycommunity I'm a little bit afraid I'llbe blacklisted for speaking out againstthem and I've already been told it'soffensive you'd never see a show likethis in the mainstream so if you likewhat I have to say and that's a show youwould like to see I'm gonna leave a linkto the Kickstarter or check it outcigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarteralright sorry this video so long thankyou so much for listening hit me up onthe social medias if you'd likeyouwell as a friend of

you know soanyway the woman who I was renting theroom in her apartment she was 26 yearsold for kids from four different fathersmost of them incarcerated and you knowwhen I asked her what do you do she saidI'm in the system as her parents were asher kids will be you know that's thesituation when you are put on welfareyou are meant to stay there so you knowand she would tell me about how like thebuzzwords she would use to get moremoney and if you have more kids you getmore money and you know meanwhile everyday she would come home with shoppingbags of like X boxes and iPads and herTV went from like the floor to theceilingthe thing is though you cannot cannotcannot blame these people they havenever known anything else that you areborn into the system you know whatDemocrats do is that they basically getpeople hooked on drugs the drug of freemoney you know and then they say that ifyou want your fix you have to keepvoting for us I've seen firsthand thedestruction caused by these Democratpolicies and it's bad um you know it'svery frustrating trying to discuss thissubject with liberals about the welfarestate because they are coming from aplace that is theoretical that they'veheard about in a classroom I've livedthis and people do not realize just howtoxic it is and how generational it isand how people are just beingset up for failure it's bad so anyway Ieventually clawed my way out of there Ifound my own place and now I had to dealwith all of these things that hadhappened um you know I'm not gonna lieit was difficult for a long time Ireally struggled and you know I had alot of depression and it was sort of youknow almost like suicidal for a whileyou know I still have a scar on my handfrom all the nights I went to sleepclutching a knife yes I know what you'rethinking yes it changed my views on theSecond Amendment but you know I gotbetter I had to put the work in to bementally well and be healthy and youknow that's my responsibility I'm not avictim with these left it's as if theyencourage emotional instability theywant you to just do in your victimhoodand you can't do that you know we can'thelp the cards were dealt in life wecan't help the things that happen to usbut whether you're a victim or asurvivor is how you handle it is how youplay those cards is what happens after Ieventually got through it and found mystrength and you know and the thing isthe thing that made me feel betterthroughout this time were offensiveoff-color rape jokes I would seek outevery one I could find every comedianand it is the only thing that like gotme over it and these are the things theywant to ban so anyway these things sortof stayed in the back of my mind but Inever really connected the dots betweenthem so a couple of years went by andnow trigger warnings were everywhere youcould not read a news article without atrigger warning especially on thissubject so you know I'd put in all thiswork to be strong and be healthy and bewell-adjusted and now I was being toldthat I'm some sort of victim who is toofragile and too damaged to even read anews article without a warningso anyway I'm a writer so I had a blogat the time that was basically likeshort stories funny things from my lifeand I decided to write a blog about thiswhole experience you know because Iwanted to show a few things I wanted toshow that this happens to men it happensto way more guys than anyone realizes itjust isn't talked about there isn't thesame level of education you know and Ialso want to give a perspective ofstrength and hueand not victimhood you know I wanted toshow that people who have been throughthings like this in their life are toughstrong resilient people we are not thesefragile mentally ill china dolls thatthey'll have you believe and I also wantto call out the hypocrisy of theseactivists so I wrote this blog andwithin 48 hours I had hundreds ofmessages from angry leftists and socialjustice warriors calling me every namein the world you know how dare you writethis how dare you say you're not avictim women have it worse you know howdare you call out these activists whenyou should be thanking them thankingthem that's funny you know telling meI'm making it up my favorite thing thatthey said was that simply by talkingabout how I fought back against myattacker that I am marginalizing andvictimizing anyone who didn't first ofall where do they all learn to talk thesame no they all say the same buzzwordsso according to them I have no ownershipover my life and my story to even talkabout it and this really showed me howliberals treat the people they claim tochampion when one says something thatthey don't want to hear these peoplethey didn't like how I was talking aboutit they want their victims to be cryingand quivering and shaking in a cornerand dependent on them and I was somebodywho's standing tall not crying andsaying I don't need you to triggerwarnings so the thing is if the thingsthat had happened years prior were setoff the little spark in my mind this wasthe tank of gasoline on top of thatbecause this happened right as theelection was heating up it was likeearly 2016 so I'd always been veryinvolved in politics I went to Iowa tocampaign for Obama in 2008 I voted forhim three times all my family areDemocrats so initially I was like okayI'll be for Bernie but then I startedresearching things and realizing waitthis doesn't add up none of this makessense I you know I voted for him veryhalf-heartedly because I didn't knowwhat else to doand then I was like okay I'll be forHillary and then I fell down the rabbithole of research and I found out thehistory of the Democraticand I found out things that I had noclue were going on all this time youknow I've been in a bubble for years ofjust watching MSNBC all day and I wasfinding out things that I had no cluewere happening I didn't know that Obamatook us from two wars to seven wars Ididn't know that his cabinet washandpicked by Citigroup I didn't knowall of these things about the ClintonFoundation all the things with foreigngovernments in Saudi Arabia Morocco andlike all of the corruption all thethings have been going on for so longand we're continuing to go on and thething is all of these things that I wasnow learning were in such contrast towhat I was hearing in the media and fromfriends and people saying oh you justhate her because she's a womanyou know when no that was literally theonly reason I even considered voting forher if you put a moment of thought intoall of the things and think about whatDemocrats ever done for the people ifthey claimed to champion you know evenevery ounce of gay rights that has beenmade the past decade has simply beenundoing Bill Clinton's policies myparents are both cancer survivors andthe cost of their health insurancedoubled and tripled under Obama carethey really got screwed by it but it'sas if it never even occurred to any ofus you don't have to vote Democrat it isso programmed into you from schoolonwards that there are basically twoidentities that you can have in lifeyou're one or the other Democrat or Naziand that doesn't work for me my entirelife I was led to believe that ifsomebody isn't a leftist and isn't aDemocrat that they are just a homophobicracist sexist Nazi and I always believedthat because I had never met anybody inNew York who wasn't a Democrat butduring that summer of 2016I started making new friends and Istarted meeting all of these people whowere conservatives and libertarians andTrump supporters and Republicans and Irealized that they are nothing of thesort that we have most things in commoneven where we disagree and person afterperson that I would meet honestly showedme more kindness and more acceptancethan these liberals ever did andcertainly more than the gay communityever did and it really showed me howwrong these narratives are that areimpounded into our heads so you knowlong story short or not short but longstory long asorry you guys for rambling so um but umanyway I left the Democratic Party and Ibecame very outspoken against the leftbecause I think that these are toxic badregressive ideas that are bringing usbackwards and making every group hateeach other and they need to be activelyfought against especially when you thinkabout how much power they have theycontrol every cultural institution soanyway in doing so I lost all my friendsI lost probably about 90% of my friendsfor me at least it was a thousand timesharder coming out as a centrist againstthe left than it was coming out as gayyou know and then I found people likeDave Rubin and christina hoff sommerspeople who were finally saying thethings that I had been feeling for yearsbut just didn't have the language to beable to identify them as regressiveleftist and that's what they are thething is what Democrats do that is sogenius but so evil is that they fusetheir partisan policies together withpeople's identities so if you don't wantthe Christian Baker to be forced to bakethe gay wedding cakeyou just take gay people if you opposeyou know things like illegal immigrationor the welfare state or whatever youjust hate black people if you don't voteHillary you just hate women and this ishow they are able to control people byinstilling fear if you don't go along ifyou ask questions if you don't justagree with them then you will be thesenames they call you and what I wouldreally say to anybody who is like-mindedthat's afraid to speak out is toremember one thing there's no such thingas an insult something is either true orit is not true so it doesn't matter whatthey call you because a lot of peopleare afraid of being called all thesethings I've been called every name youcan imagine I mean I'm a gay half Jewrape sir for all these things thatthey're supposed to stand for me I'msupposed to be I should have property ofthe DNCtattooed on my ass but you see how theytreat anybody who asks questions anybodywho challenges their dogma it is areligion and what I would really say toanybody who still supports this is whereare things better where is one thingwhere we're better off where is one insince where people are more unified orget along better or anything of the sortI only see negative things what good isthis doing who is this helping and ifnothing maybe it's time to walk away andtry something else so in conclusion Iwould just like to say that I think onething that's really important for us whohave walked away from the left is for usto not then take on the qualities thatwe walked away from to not buy intogroupthink and tribalism I think it isincumbent on all of us to improve theright and it improved the RepublicanParty and take back the center so anywaythank you guys so much for listening andsorry for my long ramblings but anywayyou know as a Russian bot in conclusionI will just saydosvedanya hey guys just wanted to addthis as a PS as I said I'm a writer andI've created a TV show that is basicallya walk away perspective of being gay andsingle and it's a very critical look atthis conformist post modernist gaycommunity I'm a little bit afraid I'llbe blacklisted for speaking out againstthem and I've already been told it'soffensive you'd never see a show likethis in the mainstream so if you likewhat I have to say and that's a show youwould like to see I'm gonna leave a linkto the Kickstarter or check it outcigarettes and Valentines on Kickstarteralright sorry this video so long thankyou so much for listening hit me up onthe social medias if you'd likeyouwell as a friend of mine once said onceupon a time I was a liberal I'm notquite as good at the smoldery blue-steelsort of stares Brandon is but I'll do mybestwe are raised to be leftist we areraised to be loyal soldiers to theDemocratic Party even when I was in highschool but in public school the historyteacher took the class on an illegaltrip to Cuba to teach about the joys ofsocialism and when they asked him why hewas like oh well I'm a communist youknow of course um you know this schoolthey had no debate Club no civics clubbut there was communism club so you knowit is just impounded in our heads at anearly age I had always been a liberalbut I never really bought into thiswhole collective [ __ ] I was always arebel I was always different even interms of being gay I never felt acceptedby the gay community I never felt like Iwas part of them I always felt judgedand they're mainly all about groupthinkand conformity and looking speakingacting thinking exactly as they do andthat was just never what I was aboutso I guess my red pill story is a littlebit darker than some people's so I guessI'll just say that in summer of 2012 Ihad a home invasion sort of thing and Iwas raped sorry there's weird to talkabout so openlyyou know without going into all thedetails I guess I was living in anapartment in Brooklyn with like fiveroommates and you know they were allleftist activists and all into drugs andone guy who was my roommate at the timewas very closeted and so you know theymoved out and I guess he kept his keysyou know I was there alone five in themorning you know but anyway the point isat the time all of my friends wereradical leftists you know male feministsocial justice warriors rape activiststhe works those are favorite words allthey ever talked about rape rape cultureI hate the term by the way so I reallythought that going to these people likewow they're experts in rape they youknow it's all they talk about that Ireally thought they would support me andhave my back and help me seek justiceand all that that wasn't quite thereception II learned very quickly that when thishappens to a guy nobody wants to hearabout it nobody will let you talk aboutit nobody cares I would try and talkabout I needed to talk about it you knowwith my friends and nobody cared theywould smile nod and immediately changethe subject yet then every moment ofevery day I would be told by them wellimagine how women feel and women have itworse and you know these women theycan't walk down the street without beingraped and you know oh these women theyget raped and it ruins their lives andwomen women when you know it's as ifthey were telling me to just shut upbecause women have it worse I justcouldn't believe the hypocrisy of thesepeople at this time - it was all in thenews about comedians and rape jokes andwanting to ban that so these same peoplethen everyday we're just talking abouthow you know they're protesting somecomedian and rape jokes and rape isnever funny rape is never funny and Ijust thought to myself in that moment Iwas like you know I don't know how Idon't know when but someday I'm gonnafind a way to laugh about what happenedto me just to spite them so it is thistime to that I noticed how politicallycorrect everyone was becoming that youcould not say a word without beingcalled some sort of name this one time Ihad gone on a really awkward date withthis guy where he asked if he could kissme um so when I like told friends aboutthis I wrote a post that you know it'svery unattractive when someone asks tokiss you these same people then jumpdown my throat you're a sexist and youneed affirmative consent and you'readvocating rape you're a rape apologistyou know knowing what I had just gonethrough so this is how they treat peoplethat they claim to champion you know butanyway there were a couple of instancesthat led to my red pill hang so if thatwas the first one the second was thisnow after this happened obviously I hadto get out of that apartment I couldn'tbe there but it was the middle of themonth I know where to go I had no moneyI couldn't find an apartment so I endedup calling some room rental servicewhere you can just move in that day sothey said they had a place super cheapLower East Side in Manhattan greatneighborhood I was like perfect I'lltake it so I show up there with mythingsit's in the projects I lived in theprojects for about a month and a halfnow let me tell you something you cannotlive in the projects for any amount oftime and come out of there illiberalit's not possible I think I was veryignorant as to just how dangerous it wasyou know in retrospect I really don'tknow how I survived especially lookinglike an emaciated albino alien vampirelike I do but I think people don'trealize just how bad the situation is inplaces like that it's bad the peoplethere are so dangerous you knowassaulting people mugging people there'spiss and [ __ ] everywhere and you knowneedles hanging out of their arms andthose are the good ones you know

hey walk away family um first of allbefore I get to talking I want to give ashout out to Asia Alvarez she actuallyinspired me to make walk away video ifyou haven't seen her video go check itout her name is aja Alba Reyes yeah it'san amazing story so shout out to youAsia thank you and definitely check outher video it's good um so I didn'tpre-plan I didn't think about what I wasgonna say my kind just wanted to wing itand be in the moment you know um alsoI've invited you into my house so yeahyou're good to see my messy room but youget to see me in my element so anyway myname is Orlando gray I live in WestVirginia southern West Virginia theheart of Appalachia very conservativebaby small town I'm 26 years olddone the whole College thing all thatjazz and somehow being a 26 year oldmillennial college graduate I've somehowended up conservative oh I put the icingon that cake I'm also gay oh how doesthat happen you say how in the world canyou be same-sex attracted andconservative you know five or six yearsago if you would have told me that Iwould be Who I am right now I would havelaughed in your face I don't know how ithappened either um you know I listen toother people's videos and seems likesome people have very definitive momentswhere they say oh they have theirawakening they had their epiphany theywere enlightened I think that mymetamorphosis my transformation was alittle more subtle than thatI definitely think it happened overtimes can't pinpoint know one time whenI was like you knowthis whole liberal movement this wholeDemocratic Party thing is enough I wasdefinitely more of a just a progressionI metamorphosis type thing and I'm veryhappy that it happened that way you knowyou can see no change in growth so it'svery interesting to be able to look backand see you know why was five or sixyears ago and as a 18 19 year old youngman - you know somebody in their mid tolate 20s now it's very interesting veryinteresting but anyway yeah when I wasyounger my grandparents told me and likeeverybody you know we adopt theirpolitical beliefs of our parents untilwe're old enough to form our own beliefsand you know that's most everybodythat's just something that you know weall go through as were you knowdeveloping and finding ourselves I wastold that Democrats are for the poor andRepublicans are for the rich that's whatI was told growing up by my grandparentsthat's all that I really knew about theparty system and so when I got into highschool and was being active in clubs andI joined the Young Democrats and I wasas active as it could be with them youknow for it being a small school youknow much in the parades and Christmasum I remember being asked for someChristmas ideas I was like you know weshould have a poster that says evenJesus wrote a donkey the teacher was notabout thatand I remember the teacher for the YoungRepublicans I remember him being methinking anyway at that time you knowhe's just an old white man he's you knowjust awful ways mean you know that'sreally how people saw him that's how Isaw him I just didn't have a good a goodtake on you know Republicans and after Igraduated high school andI had been out six six six since 16years old so you know being gay is ahuge part of my story not as far aspolitics go I don't think you know itwas just one small minor part of who Iam and I can get to that laterbut you know when I got into intocollege and ended up going to MarshallUniversity anybody knows we got Marshalltotally spent a semester there and itwas a great semester as far as socialthings go not as far as grades um had tocome back home after that but thankfullyyou know I did get my act together andgraduated college and I've been out forthree years now post college life is notthat fun y'all it's not being adults notfunjust F waha so anyway um you know when Iwas in college being I'm home for thefirst time in being and you know more ofa city than what I was used toespecially very gay and open city no Iwas going to the barsI was watching drag shows not sayingthat there's anything per se wrong withthat but it was my first time being ableto express myself in a homosexual mannerI guess you could say this time I wasable to really explore my sexuality andand and and start that process more offiguring out who I am and such yeah sowhen I came home after that semester andat Marshall there was a little morelacks as far as being home and livingwith my parents to being a commuter atcollege so I won't say that there was alot going on but when I came back Ijoined the international student cluband that was very life changing I wasable to develop a love for traveling tolove for culture a love for people ofdifferent religions I love for people ofdifferent nationalities from differentracesand I feel like that was a very definingexperience being able to open up and getto know people for who they were and Ican share an experience of going to huga Muslim woman who was a friend of mineand she denied my hug and told me thatyou know she couldn't hug me as a Muslimwoman me being just you know a malefriend or wasn't something that shecould do which was eye-opening to me youknow I learned something if there like alot of that I could have only learned inthat settingeven had a Muslim male friend come up tome and tell me he's from Saudi Arabiayou know he said back home you know theperception of gay people in Saudi Arabiais not the best its capital punishmentthere's your car and a homosexual actand it can be proved and taken to courtand such death penalty he said himgetting to know me changed hisperception of who gay people are andthat's like a very touching story youknow it's it's very nice to be able toauthentically live your life and youknow change people's perceptions that'sall about you know bringing the worldcloser together and and and gettingconnected and bridging gaps and andtalking and sharing stories so I'mhoping all of this is soundin on trackno sound and on point because I think alot of this is meshing with the walkwaymovement and I'm hoping that you guysare putting those pieces together as I'mtalking as I'm trying to sort throughthem myselfbut yeah so back to the gay thing once Iguess maybe it is important I amsame-sex attracted however Calmaah I don't act on it um I am religiousand you know I've been that way sincehigh school as I've always held thatdeeply seated belief that homosexualityis a sin that isn't to say that you knowI haven't explored or tried to findmyself acted on it as all young peopledo as we all grow up and try to findourselves of course of course I've donethat um I don't need to go back and tellany of thatbecause you know it is what it is but asI've gotten older I have found formyself a deeply deeply seededconvictions deeply seeded beliefs deeplyseeded morals and I founded that itmakes me happier to live according tothe dictates of my conscience than it isto go out pretending to be somethingthat I'm not and I feel like in today'sclimate that's not been a very popularmessage and it's not been a popularmessage at all granted I respect all mygay and lesbian brothers and sisters whodo not choose the same path that I do Irespect them and in turn I very muchhope that they respect me that'ssomething that I wanted to touch on tooyou know on the little liberal movementyou know gays transgenders questioningnon-binaryI don't even know honestly I don't evenknow what half of those letters standfor anymore you know we I get lumped intogether with some of these people and Ican honestly say I don't know what it'slike to have gender dysphoria I don'tknow what it's like to be a lesbian Idon't know what it's like to be bisexualI don't know what it's like to beasexual I don't know what it's like tobe any number of these supposed gingersand sexualities that we have right nowso that's something that I haven't as oflate taking kindly to you know I don'tlike being lumped in together with withthose other you know my my struggles areare are not the same as theirs and Ican't relate you know they're they don'tshare and I don't share their sameexperiences anyway I digress so being agay celibate Christian has put me on theoutskirts of the gay culture which isfine because I don't participate in gayculture I don't hit up the clubs and Idon't do inof that I also puts me somewhat on theoutskirts of Christian churches I'm veryopen about my struggle because I feellike I need to be because there's peopleout there like me I only know one personpersonally who shares my sameconvictions but I know there's otherpeople out there and I want to be ableto spread that message is that to saythat I'm perfect or that I don't sin orthat I don't have struggles of coursenot but it is very much my conviction tostay celibate to be single to have Jesusas my only husband now until the daythat I die you know because ultimatelyheavens where I want to be so it's beenkind of a balancing actyou know people on one hand ohyou'resame-sex attractions um are sinful and Ilove in and of themselves so then peopleon the side of gay cultureoh you're self-hating you're homophobicyou're got internalized homophobia youdon't love yourself you know that kindof nonsense you know it's just having abalancing act and and and no one whowent home not to let into your circle itis what it is so that being said[Applause][Music]obviously I'll fit more in line withconservative values only recently justchanged my voting my party voting partyto Republican and I understand that inthe conservative movement on everybody'sRepublican there might even be somepeople who are Democrats you knowalthough this movement I feel like isfor people who are walking away from theDemocratic Party but you know I'm openenough to say you know if you'reconservativewhether you be libertarian orindependent Republican you know it'snice that we can come together and shareour stories and who we are be able totalk that's what this is aboutthat's I feel like what the walkawaymovement what the conservative movementis ultimately about been able to cometogethertalk and share our stories and make theworld smaller you know there's so muchroom in this neoconservatism movement inthis walkaway movement for people whoobviously share some things in commonand and don't share some things incommon that's okay we're going to talkabout him that doesn't mean that we'regoing to belittle each other or hateeach other you're not gonna find thathere like you would in the DemocratParty in the Liberal Party where youknow thought policing is rampant youknow we don't thought police here openwe let people share their stories andthat's beautiful that is so beautiful soI hope you can see where some of thethings I shared previously are fittingin line here I understand that there aregay Republicans Log Cabin Republicanswho act on their sexuality and aremarried very moral and upstandingindividuals do I agree with thelifestyle no I certainly don't do theyagree with how maybe I'm living maybemaybe not but do we share some things tocome and yes we do are we going to beliteral and hate on each other no we'renot we're gonna talk we're gonna sharewe're gonna be open and ultimately we'regonna love each other so that's themessage I have been sharing you knowthat this new conservative movement isopen up to everybody transgenderbisexual gay straight black white PuertoRican or Asian everybody's welcome hereand I want to be that person who helpsto spread the message that hey you youyou can have a place here you belonghere and so some of the things that I'veseen in my own life you know me and mybest friend used to be best friend wedon't talk anymoreshe deleted me from Facebook where youknow no big deal it's just Facebook umbut it was over you know an abortionpost and that was the big catalyst forme you know I used to be so pro-choicethen something hit me seeing people'sabortion survivor stories you know andI've been pro-life for yearyears and years have been conservativefor years and years but I'm just now youknow seeing this movement I'm so gladthat I could be a part of it butabortion has been the really big issueyou know I don't want to be like a oneone issue person but I can't in a willnot vote for somebody who shares apro-choice believe you know that's theone issue that I just can't get behindthat's the one issue that's the onedividing line issue for me you know Ithink the most fundamental human rightis the right to life and unfortunatelythe Democrat Party as we've seen hasgone from there and safe abortions toyou know a baby born alive after anattempted abortion like governor northum you know let's have a conversationabout it there's nothing to have aconversation about it's a baby whosurvived an abortion there's nothing tohave a club there's nothing to have aconversation about so the Democrat Partyhas moved so far left and I thinkthey're even leaving some of theirconstituents behind some of the olderDemocrats behind to this new millenniallive-and-let-live post-modernthinking you know um then I might evenlook like I would be one of those and Ihope people you know see me as anaccepting person and would come up andapproach me and talk with me but youknow I don't I don't have a good tastein my mouth for you know those type ofMillennials who get behind and supportsuch things you know I I just I don't Idon't find my place there with them Ican't I can't relay which is okay youknow I don't want to thought thisisanybody but you know it is what it is soI'm glad that's why you know people ourage this thisconservative movement can be you knowthe voice in the wilderness for peoplebe the light on the heel kind of thinganyway my best fan she doesn't talk tome anymore same there I don't reallytalk with her anymore though were okaywith each other um where's haven'ttalked for months and months and monthsand months but you know how was calledby her misogynistic gay hatingculturally insensitive and bigoted justfor some of the Facebook posts that Iwas sharing and it hurt coming from herand I didn't I didn't argue back withher you know I told her it if this ishow you feel it's how you feelyou're allowed to feel how you feel Idid knock back against you over the gayhating thing but you know of course it'sunpopular for me to be sharing mymessage that hey homosexuality to me isa sinmaybe you shouldn't act on it maybe youcan find hope and restoration and Jesusyou know that message doesn't go oververy welland I know it may not go over very wellwith people who are on the walkwaymovement it may not go very well withpeople who are straight and and can'trelate to the gay lifestyle you knowthat message just isn't popular but it'sa message I'm sharing you know becauselike I said there are people like me whoare same-sex attracted and want to pickup their cross daily and put theirattractions on the back burner and Ilive for the Lord you know there arepeople who want to do that or at leastwant to try and really I think that'swhat we're all doing every day we're alljust trying at the end of the day we'reall just try and slip ups whatever we'retrying to live according to ourconvictions and yeah we finally didreconcile which is good you know I don'twant to lose friends over politicsbecause they even at the end of the dayI don't think it's that deep you know itis but it's not you know it's not worthlosingyour friendship over you know definitelynot um will we be buddies buddies againno we probably will not and I'm okaywith that um you know people go outthere's growth I'm not in the same placein life that she is we're just you knowtwo different places in our lives but Iwill always love her but I can give afew more examples in my life beingfriends with people just on Facebook youknow I love Candice Candice Owens she isjust the epitome of everything likeCandice Owens if you happen to see thisvideo go you keep doing your thing likeI just I can't express the gratitude andand the wonderful message that Candicehas been spreading and you know it'shelped to liberate my mind a little bityou know even she says that herself shewants to liberate minds that's that'sher goal in life and you know I'veshared some of her messages I remembersharing a message about the maggot onFacebook talking about how you know howwas a hat racist there's nothing racistabout a hat it's a hatyou know it's was the motto of ourpresident it shouldn't be controversialto be supportive of the President of theUnited States of America there's nothingcontroversial about that you know you'rean American you should want you shouldwant no matter how you feel about themyou should launch your president to beable to do a good job for you yourcountry that makes sensewhy would you want your president to beentangled in in Russia and and anddebacles and scandals why would you wantthat you know that blows my mind umright now of course I've got a littlebit of conversation going about it whichwas good and you know I talked about youknow black people identity politics Ithink that's awful I think I've doneinto politics are the worst and I thinkwe can all agree with that why would youlet your orientation or would you letthe color of your skin or even yourreligion per sesometimes dictate your politicsand people and people do that you know Ihave black friends who have comparedblack conservatives to the uncle off ofthe boondocks which i think is just youknow that's awfulthat literally that's awful that'sexactly the thing I'm trying to pushback against that's racism you know ifyou sit and think about it saying thatcalling black conservatives you knowCoons house bad words all thesederogatory names that's racism and youknow that's what I'm not getting peoplewho are only voting Democrat because thecolor of their skin and I'm lettingpeople know that shouldn't be thedefining factor behind who you vote foror your politics and honestly it doesn'tmake sense so you know I've seen thatwith my own friends just havingconversations on Facebook you know fromblack friends who who as I said callingblack conservatives comparing them tothe uncle from the boondocks orself-hatingcalling them crazy getting laugh emojisthat some of the posts about blackconservatives that I'm shaming so I hopepeople can whether they end up on theleft or whether then the bottom two byor somewhere in between or and anotherparty that's not Republican or DemocratI want people no matter how you vote tobe able to go inside of yourself andtake inventory you take stock of yourbeliefs and and and flesh them out andfind a party that aligns more with themwhether it be Democrat or Republican youknow at least you get out and vote youknow I'm over minded enough to know thatnot everybody out there is going tothink exactly like me not everybody outthere is going to want to be GOP that'sfinebut I feel like as people do moreresearch behind the Democrat Party andwhat we know about them you know theparty of the KKKthe KKK being the militant hand of theDemocrat Party and how the first blackpeople united to our political system inthis country were Republicans with agreat lot wasn't it 20 some Republicanswere elected before even one blackperson was elected from the DemocratParty you know and people people justare unaware of that history so no Icannot say that the Republican Party orthe conservative movement is racist Ithink it is pushed back against theracism that we're seeing on the Leftthese days this is a push back againstthe the thought policing that we'reseeing from the left these days you knowwhere it's unpopular to be able to standup and say you know at least for myselfhomosexuality is a sinI'd be ostracized from the left you knowbut there's only two genders there'sonly two sexes male and femaletransgenderism how honestly feel like isgender dysphoriamaybe we should combat it in our mindsbefore we make permanent decisions ofaltering your body altering the bodiesof five and six-year-olds before they'reold enough to decide for themselveswhether they want to be a guy or girl ora 12-year old you know maybe we canaddress what's going on in our mindsbefore we make these primitive seasonsand I have friends who are transgenderand I love them and I support them and Iwill be there for them I respect themand hopefully they can respect me enoughto to say okay I accept your beliefs itis what it is we can agree to agree todisagree but you know saying such athing as I just said on the left instantOscars ostracization so as yeah I'm wantto be able to spread the message that Ihave been spreading that there is roomfor everybody and the walkway movementthere's room for everybody and theconservative movementsince gender gay lesbian bisexualasexual black wide Asian white Christianmale not white Christian male to have aworshippers atheist there is room foreverybody you will certainly find aloving family here in the conservativemovement and I want to be able to toalso help liberate Minds especially withthe issues specific to me you know Ican't talk about what it's like to be aperson of color but I can talk aboutwhat it's like to be a same-sexattracted male in America today and Iwill say that you know it's not you knowbeing gay today is so accepted thatthere's not a lot of on the bottom ofthe totem poleas far as oppression goes these days youknow that oppression scale that the lefthas but I will say you know this isAmerica there is no better place to livein this day and age as far as civilliberties and civil rights goes umracism you know this is 2019 you guysthis country is not racist obviouslythose racist people black and whiteAsian and brownthere's racists on all sides but thiscountry itself is not racist there'snothing that I cannot do than anybodyelse can do as a gay man there's nothingthat the females the women in thiscountry can't do thatmales can we're all on equal footinghere um so this fake jumping up of civilrights and civil liberties andoppression scales and all the stuffit's Hickey floopy you know it's it'sfake news you know I am free to if Iwanted to march on the street and weighthe flag and hold the hand of a guy orto not do that um I am a free Americancitizen and that's what I'm also hopingpeople are gonna wake up to you know[Music]some of these uh I don't know it's it'sperplexing to say the leastwhat I'm seeing from the left drummingup this thick racism you know was 2019and I want to say that in the abortionissue it's well it's 2019 you guys ahuman life is a human lifewe're so past that you know babies arebabies I don't care if the babies growup to be Wiccan Muslim Jewish I hopethat go up to be a Christian but thatthey don't hey it's coola baby's a baby and they deserve lifesucking a fetus out of a

soi walked away from the democratic partyand the left more broadly officiallyin 2018 i left the democratic partybut there's a lot of context thatsort of needs to be said instead of justsort of giving you kind of what thefinal strawwas which ultimately it ended upactually being the kavanaughconfirmation hearings but there'simportant context if you want tounderstand me and understandmy story and how i came to leave thedemocratic party on the leftso i'll start by saying that you knowwhat initially got me interestedin left-wing politics circa like 2010when i was a teenagerand i first started getting interestedin politics it was becausei was an atheist and i'm still not superbigon organized religion but i've softenedmy stance a little bit towards it forsure thanks to people like ben shapiroand jordan peterson sort of showing mesome of the positive aspects of religionand i certainly have a lot of respectfor those guys and for a lot ofreligious people that i knowbut around 2010 i was like a hardcoreatheistand i sawthe religious fundamentalism ofchristianity in particular coming fromthe right asas being something that was verycensorioussomething that was opposed to freedom ofspeech in many ways because there werecertain jokes you can't tellthere are certain video games you can'tplay there are certainthings you cannot discuss or evenacknowledge as it pertains to maybe it'srelated to sex or homosexuality orsomething that's violence like videogamesthere were all of these things that iwas told as a teenagerwho wanted to have nuanced conversationswho wanted to do things that are tabooand rebellious and wanted to discussthose thingsin a nuanced and interesting wayi saw this censorship of all of thatas really coming from the right at thetime again this is around like 2010.you know there was a big scare during mychildhood in my teenage years overlike i said the violent video gamescan't play video games and i was a biggamer so i didn't like that i saw thatas largely coming from the religiousrightand in many ways it did there was a bigscare over homosexuality anda frank discussion of sexuality ingeneral largely coming from the rightand a lot of this was done under theguise of religious fundamentalism whichi came to really really dislike and istill don't likefundamentalism i still don't likereligious fundamentalismbut where i feel the censorship andreligiousfundamentalism is coming from the sourceof it as far as i'm concerned todayis very different than what it was in2010 a lot has changedin 10 years so when i went off tocollege i ended up joining the collegedemocrats because again i had thisaversion to the rightbecause of religious fundamentalism andcensorshipand the fact that i felt like i couldhave more interesting conversations atthat time when i started college in theearly 2010si felt like i could have moreinteresting and frank conversationsabout a lot of topicswith people on the left because i stillfelt like the censorship was coming fromthe rightand you know at first that worked outfor me duringmy first year of college and then youknow around year twoit was around year like 20 it was like201415. i started to notice something goingonin my own house on the left in my ownlittle political homewas something very disturbing to me assomeone who doesn't like fundamentalismand dogmaand censorship for someone who ispro-free speechthere was something very distressinggoing onon the left because it was around thistime 2014-15when feminism and black lives matter andall of these identity groupbased ideologies started tojust explode in terms of power andinfluenceespecially on a college campus where iwas at the timeand all of the sudden i would haveconversations with my left wing peersand my right wing peers because i hadright-wing peers i've always liked tohave people on both sides of thepolitical spectrumin my friend groups in my social groupsand in my discussionsall of a sudden i was being censored andi was being told there were certainthings that i cannot discusseven in a nuanced and facts driven wayeven coming from a good place because ialways try to come from a good placewhen i discuss politicsall of a sudden all of that kind ofcensorshipand all of that kind of like oh don'ttalk about that no free speech be damnedyou can't talk about that that way evenif it's truethat started to come from the left itstarted to come from the leftmostly as a result of theseidentity-based political movements likefeminismwhere you know i couldn't talk about thewage gap or rape culture in a frank andhonest waythings like that things that are hogwashand that i knew were hogwash even when iwason the left i was like i've looked intothe statistics on these things this justisn't trueyou know i was on the left because i waskind of part of the new atheist movementand i had left-wing economic views istill have left-wing economic views buti didn't believe in the wage gapi didn't believe that we live in a rapeculture and then with black lives matterin 2014-15 it was kind of the first wavenow we have this new wave of black livesmatterthere was the initial wave after michaelbrown um you know there was a little bitof a thing after trayvon martin but itwasn't quite the same because a copdidn'tshoot and kill trayvon martin so reallyit exploded in 2014 when michael brownwas killed by a police officerand i looked into it and that wascompletely justifiedhe attacked the cop and so the cop shothim becausenews flash you can't hit cops you can'ttry to take cops guns they'll shoot youand they should sorry likeit's tragic i think it's terrible when ayoung person whether they're black whiteor whatever uses loses their lifebut if they did something stupid likehit a cop or try to take their gunand this this is something i said at thetime in 2014 when it happened to michaelbrown and people told me like no youcan't say thatlike why are the people were like whyare you even bothering to look into thefactsthey're like all that matters is that ablack person was hurt by a cop andthat's racismand i was like wait wait wait what aboutthe facts though and they were like nothe facts don't matterwhat you're saying is racist and i waslike whatrace what i'm not racist like no one'sracist there are so few racistsin this country and there's certainlyvery few racists on this campusthat people will talk about how ourcollege campus was an environment thathad racism and i was likethere's very little racism in thiscountry period let alone on a collegecampuslike where i was at the time soi'm having this weird experience around2014-15 where i'm inthe college democrats and i'm risingthrough the ranks of you know democraticactivismand i'm pretty far on the left and istill have pretty left-wing economicviewsi'm going to talk about that later i'mstill in many waysnot diametrically opposed to left-wingpoliciesbut the rhetoric and the censorshipwas something that really made me startto thinklike are these really my people like mypeople have to be the people who want tohave frank discussions they have to bethe people who are pro free speechthat is that that is a need for me thatisn't that is a deal breaker for me ifyou're not pro free speechi can't identify with your politicalmovementand in 2014-15 i started to come on tothe fact that the left had a problemwith freedom of speechand censorship and that they had thisand this is what really disturbed meabout it rememberi was an atheist still not a huge fan ofreligion butneedless to say this is all to say therewas a religiousaspect to this censorship on the leftthat the right absolutely does not havea monopoly on religious fundamentalismas i learned in this instance becauseintersectionality or social justicebeing an sjwbeing woke what i call woke supremacythis stuff is inherently religious ithad all the trappings of religiousfundamentalismnamely that it kept people from thinkingfreely and wanting to have frankdiscussionsabout things in the pursuit of truthwhich is what i am doingwhen i have political discussions i ampursuing truth and i've always likeddoing this this is who i am and what iwant to doand i noticed that the censorship on theleft wasn't just censorship it wasn'tjustanti-free speech it was religious andculty it was like a cultlike people just would not think freelyand if you went against them they get soangry and they cast you outand call you a bigot you know on theright maybe they call you a blasphemeror tell you what you said wasoffensive and they do the same exactthing on the left except call you abigot which is almost worselike i'd rather be called a blasphemerthan a bigot i'd rather be called youknow maybe the right would call youin the early 2000s maybe they'd call youunpatriotic or somethingor or whatever but we wouldn't call youracist i mean that's a labelthat carries so much weight and whenpeople call you thatit's horrifyingand people would call me this when ispoke out against black lives matteror islamic extremism or feministextremism and just the hogwash that goesinto all of these things the bunkstatisticsand so i started to get a little bit ofthe sense that if i'm anti-religiousfundamentalismand i'm anti-censorship maybe i don'tbelong on the leftbut i persisted as a democratic liberalactivistfor a couple of years because i feltlike this stuff was unique tocollege campuses especially being on acollege campus at the timepeople told me like you know some peopletry to call me down there like hey youknow i understand these people are kindof extreme these sjws these wokestersbutyou know it's just college campuses onceyou get out of here you'll be free of ityou know just deal with it now and it'llget better later and ii wasn't sure if they were right but iwas like i hope you're right i just kindof hopedand so i went on still being a democratstill beinga leftist untili noticed it actually starting to seepinto the democratic party itself andlike the left establishmentlike it went from kind of the crazycollege kids to being the leftdemocratic establishmentand at first they would just ignorethings the democratic establishmentso for instance after the 2016 electionwas the big turning pointthe the sjws and the woke leftcompletely losttheir [ __ ] minds after trump wonoh my god and look i was upset toobecause again remember i'm a leftist atthis point i'm a democrati was upset when trump won i'm still nota trump supporteralthough my my views on him have changeda little bit i'm still not a trumpsupporteri was upset when he won but the the thesjw woke left that i was never fully apart of even though i was a democraticactivistthey just went crazy and you hadsomething like the uc berkeley riotand the democratic party that i had beentold would control these people like ohjust remember it's just the leftactivists it's just the college campusesit's just the college sjwsit won't leave the campus this isn'tgoing to become a thing for thedemocratic party they'll protect youand i believed that to an extent andthen the uc berkeley riot happened whenmilo yiannopoulos went to speak at ucberkeley and they[ __ ] burned down the school courtyardprevented his speech from taking placeby attacking people and assaulting themand starting fires and they're masingpeople they're hitting them with batsit was awful and i saw the footage infebruary of 2017. i'm still a democratat this pointand i said what is this how are weletting this happenhow are we not calling this out asdemocrats and as liberalshow are we not saying this isunacceptable i just i believedup until that point as a politicalthinker i had justalways believed okay democrats andrepublicans disagree on things but atthe point where it comes to blowsthey'll calm it down i always justthought you know ifa democrat physically assaults arepublican which is what was happeningat uc berkeley was this you knowrepublican conservative speaker wascomingand so the kids that wanted to go watchhim not all of them were evenconservativebut nonetheless they were attackedphysically attackedand they had to cancel the event theycensored his speech through politicallymotivated violencealso known as terrorism there's no otherword for that that's what it isit's this violence with the politicalgoal to censor the speech it's terrorismand so this terrorism i always thoughtwas like the left and the right isagainst thislike our country will never come to thisthe democratic party will call this outand i believed and i think to an extentit's still true that the republicanparty would do so if something happenedon the leftyou know if if i don't know superfar-rightwhite nationalists went and attackedsome left-wing speaker in his audience ifeel like the right would call it outbut after the uc berkeley riots nobodysaid anything none of the democrats saida goddamn thingnancy pelosi and chuck schumer and theleaders on the left not even barackobamawould say a thing barack obama who hadjust leftoffice who i admired and believed indidn't say a damn thingabout left-wing terrorism at uc berkeleyand this was my red pill momentthis was when i really started to thinki gotta walk away from thislike these are not my people if you'renot willing to call this outthen i can't be a part of of this thingwhatever it is this culti was disgusted i was disgustedby uc berkeley and the response to itwhere some you know the democratic partybrassthe establishment democratic party in dcignored it and then you hadstudent activists and college democratssupporting it openlyin the school newspaper at uc berkeleyand some of my colleagues in the thesort of youth democratic activismuh world at the time you know i wasstill a part of that world i was stillpretty young i was in my early 20sstill in college they were telling melike no this guy's a nazi they shouldn'tbe allowed and i was like he's not anazilike what like you can't you can't justattack this guy's eventit was crazy people were defending itpeople were ignoring it and it finallygot me to think like ohthe democratic party itself like theleft-wing establishmentis losing its mind but at this point i'mstill a democrati still didn't leave the democraticparty because i was like okay i mean i'mnot a republican i'm not conservative idon't want to support trumpso i'll stay a democrat and i'll try toget them to see that they need to speakout against this stuffbecause my idea was well if they'reignoring it but they're not necessarilyexplicitly endorsing itmaybe i can talk some sense into thembecause they just don't understand howbig of a problem it isand after the evergreen college thing itried to use that as evidence like lookhow bad this can get a whole collegecampus had a meltdownthey basically formed almost like alynch mob around brett weinsteinwho is a progressive just like i was andi tried to use the evergreen collegemeltdown as evidence and say looklook how bad this thing can get there'sthese maoist takeovers on universitiesand they still with the oh it's justit's a college campus don't worry aboutitoh god so this is 2017 nowwe're getting to my official walk awaymoment in 2018.so all this time i'm like i'm still onthe left i'm still a democrati still voted democrat andyou know like i voted for for clinton in2016.and we're getting to around the 2018election cycle and this whole time i'vebeen having discussions with people whoare likedon't worry it's just college campusesthat's all evergreen was that's all ucberkeley wasthe democratic party is not going toaccept the wokeness and the socialjustice and the woke supremacy fullscaleand we get to brettkavanaugh's confirmation hearing inseptember octoberof 2018 and we seethese rape allegations brought up by thedemocratsand propped up even though they weremost likely falsethere was no evidence all i asked forwhen this happened was a shredof evidence supporting the notion thatbrett kavanaugh had committed the crimeof which he was accused which wasattempted rapeand i would take that very seriously ifit were truebut it probably wasn't i wasn't there ican't say with 100certainty but i can say like 98 or 99certaintythis didn't happen this woman whois a democrat is a leftistdidn't say anything for 35 years comesup at the last minute during brettkavanaugh's confirmation hearings and ispropped up by the democratssaying that he attempted to rape her inthe i think she said it was in like the80sand the democrats did this like fullcourt press thisfull machine politics [ __ ]of propping up these most likely falseallegationsand it was all under the guise of likebelieve all women of feminism which isone of the tenets of woke supremacy ofintersectionality of social justiceactivism and i went guysthis is the democratic party that wasthe moment where i knew it's thedemocratic party it's notjust some crazy buzzfeed journalistsit's not just some crazy college kidsit's the democratic party okay they havefully accepted this woke stuff feminismand believe all womenthe whole me too thing which look ofcoursei'm against sexual harassment andassault but a lot of the me too stuffturns out to be falsethis was most likely falseall of that me too and feminism stuffit's woke stuffit's social justice warrior stuff andthe democratscompletely incorporated it into theirplatform and into who they are and intotheir dna as a partywhen they they ramrod it they railroadedbrett kavanaugh with these almostcertainly false allegations for whichthere was not a shred of evidence andthere was plenty of evidence to the factthat they probably were not trueso in october of 2018 i left thedemocratic partythat was it that was iti just i couldn't do it anymore i had noexcusei had nothing i told people like i justi i don't know how to tell youthat this is wrong i don't know how totell youthat beating people for their politicalviews and attacking political eventsterrorism is wrong i don't know how totell you that false allegations of rapeare a bad thingand that they happen and that they'reawful and that what was done to brettkavanaugh was awfulbecause it was deceptive and it wasmanipulative it wasusing false rape allegations forpolitical points for political purposesthat's disgustingand i couldn't be a part of thedemocratic party that was partaking initso i left i left the democratic partyin october of 2018 and in 2018 when ivoted i voted splitticket i voted for some democrats that ithought were still pretty reasonable andi voted for some republicans that ithought were pretty reasonablei did that for the first time in my lifeup until that point i had voted democratalways voted for clinton in 2016.so you know that's my story of why iwalked away from the democratic party ina nutshell was because of religiousfundamentalismthe religion of wokeness the religionof woke supremacy social justicenonsensethe censorship of free speech theattacking people for their speech theterrorismtrying to block political speech throughviolencethe propping up of false allegations allin the name of wokenessall in the name of this self-righteous[ __ ]where they say that it's oh it's forwomen and minorities no it's notit's for power the democratic partydoesn't give a [ __ ] about women andminoritiesyou know that because whenever a womanor minority says anything vaguelyconservative or anti-wokethey get attacked by the left just likeat uc berkeley just like at evergreenso they don't care about minorities andwomen they care about powerthey think that wokeness is a way to getcheap constituents that'll clap likesealsevery time they do something vaguelypro-woman or pro-minorityand i'm not about that i'm about thenuance i'm about the honest and frankdiscussion of what's going onand being a free thinkerso i left democratic party i walked awayfrom the democratic partythat's my walk away story nowi want to add a caveat to this andthat'sthis is an important this is kind of oneof the core ideasof me saying all of this i am still inmany waysa liberal i have somevery liberal economic views i havesome pretty liberal social views mypositions and who i am as a person arethe same i am stillnon-religious iam not a conservative by any stretch iam not a republican i am a registeredindependenti am not supporting in 2020 nor did ijust support in 2016donald trump i don't think he's the bestperson for the job to be presidenti you know this is something i want totalk about morebut i just i i personally cannot getbehind trumpi understand more so people that do icertainly understand more after my walkaway journey than i did four years agobut i'm not supporting him in 2020.and in saying all of this i want to makesure people understandyou don't have to support donald trumpor even bea republican or a conservative to walkaway from the democratic partythat's not what i did i didn't become aconservative i didn't become arepublicani just walked away from the democratsand from the wokeprogressive left thing that is takingthem overand if you think joe biden's going tofight back against it oh you've gotanother thing comingso walk away from the democratic partyif you feel the way i feel if you don'tlike this woke stuff if you don't likecensorship if you're pro free speechwalk away from the democratic party ifyou

don't worry about like oh does thatmake me a trump voter does that make mea republican does that make me aconservativeno i mean there's nothing wrong withdoing that maybe you go all the way tothe right that's fine too if it'sgenuine and it's what you now believeafter getting new information that'sgreatbut you don't have to do that you can belike me you can be an independent freethinker who's not associated with eitherparty who's not supporting eithercandidate i'm not supporting biden ortrump in 2020.hell no i'll write someone in or i'llnot vote at allso you don't have to support trump

democratic party likei did and you will beso much better off for it i feel so muchbetter now i have made great friendsin kind of like the intellectual darkweb space in the political centrismspace in the in the free thinking spacei have made better friends than i everhad the people who are calling me racistfor being a pretty thinkerway better off way better off than i wasso do it man if you're listening to thisand you're tempted to leave but you'reafraid that you knowi don't want to support trump i don'twant to be a republican you don't haveto justleave the democratic party get the hellout of therebecause this woke stuff has taken overand it is ruining our politics and ithas certainly taken over the democraticparty and ruined that partycan't be a part of that if you're forfreedom of speech if you're a freethinkerso walk away walk away from thedemocratic party
good morning everybodyBrandon asked for videos so here's myvideo I walked away from the DemocraticParty starting in 2008 and completed mywalk in 2016 when I started watching theRepublican debates and listened toDonald Trump for the first time I'vebeen a Hillary supporter in 2008 Ithought she got a raw deal then but whenshe was a candidate in 2016 I realizedthat I didn't support her anymore shemade a lot of bad decisionsshe joined Obama's cabinet I didn'tthink she was going to get out of thereunscathed because of his innate naivebehavior in his belief that if he saidsomething it made it true so then Ghazihappened then we found out about herserver and that terrible decision shemade to do that and I think it's prettyclear why she did it so I listened toDonald Trump talking and he was talkingabout jobs jobs jobs and securing oursouthern border he was talking about theForgotten men and women these all usedto be Democrat positions but therearen't anymore the Democrats have as somany others have said they have left methey support illegal immigration theysupport open borders I live in extremelyliberal college town we're a sanctuarycity my mayor wants to set up aninjection facility for heroin users sothey can inject themselves safely it'sabsolute lunacy here and I've prettymuch been in the closet ever since Istarted supporting President Trump but Idon't want to be there anymore I've seenothers on the walk away campaign saythey wanted to have a hat or a shirt ora lawn sign and somehow or other showtheir support they were afraid and thatfear is very real I'm glad I walked awaylast year I would have run away thisyear when I see all of the hatreddirected towards the people whowork in the Trump administration theviolence the horrible harassing peoplein public last night the presidentnominated his Supreme Court pick and Ipray for him and his family that they'renot harassed that they're not harmed bythese crazies on the Left so I can't bea part of that I cannot be a part ofthat I don't see them coming back fromthat anytime soon and honestly I reallydon't care because I am happy in thisgroup of people and in the RepublicanParty where we don't see a woman wedon't see black we don't see gay andlesbian we see Americans and that's whatI've always wanted that's what I grew upwith it wasn't the color of your skin itwas the content of your character andsomehow or other the left has moved sofar away from that so this is mywalkaway story and thank youyou
but listen I really want to talk to youguys about something and this is I thinksuper super importantI actually am going to consider it acall to action because I think it's thatimportantwe the left-wing media is now no longerable to ignore us and they've reallycome out this week none of them havereached out to me personally not one butthey're writing articles anyway and allof them are doing exactly what they dowhich is telling lies and blamingeverything that doesn't go their way onRussian bonds now I know it's stupid andyou know it's stupid and we all knowit's not true and we also know that whenelection time comes around they're gonnalose horribly because they've tried thistactic before and it backfiredspectacularly so I'm not really worriedabout what the the fact that they'relying or the fact that they're lyingabout me or the campaign what I wantthough is for everybody to start doingvideo testimonials I mean that was thewhole purpose of the campaign in thefirst place because I anticipated thingslike this happening but originally Iwanted the campaign to be a videotestimonial campaign because I wantedeverybody I wanted people on the left tobe able to share their stories about whythey're walking away which would helpencourage other people on the left to bebrave and to walk away but I wantedpeople on the right to tell theirtestimonials too because I wanted asI've said many times I wanted the silentmajority to become unsilent meaning it'stime for people on the right to stopbeing passive and to stop being politeand to stop allowing the truth about whothey are to be hijacked by left-wingmedia you know who calls you racists andbigots and homophobes and whatever elseyou know I wanted people to be to havethe opportunity to come to this placeand to be supported but to be able tospeak out and look intocameras and say look this is the truthabout Who I am and to also say to thoseon the left who want to walk wait lookwe want you over here you're welcomehere but the added benefit to doing thevideo is that nobody can ever argue thatyou aren't real your face your voiceyour presence is irrefutableand as much as I love the writtentestimonials and I do people can pointto that and they can say that that'sfake it's so stupidbut I mean if that's what they want todo it gives them the leeway and theleverage to be able to do that but noone can ever say that you're fake andeven if we don't make it about that evenif we say well to hell with them andtheir their lives and their falsenarrative I still want you to do itanyway because it's important thatpeople on the right start standing upfor themselvesI'm not asking anyone to get into hugeconfrontations or debates or battles I'mcertainly not asking anyone to have youknow respond to violence with violencenothing like that but you have the rightto set the record straightabout who you are you have the right totell the truth about the kind of personyou are who and what you are and as ofnow you have a lot of people with a lotof power lying about you and the biggestweapon that you have at your disposal tofight back against those who are lyingabout you is the truth your own voiceand the truth so I'm asking you guysagain to start making video testimonialsit's so important because this is thethis is the weapon that the left isgoing to try to use against usthey're gonna try to say because theylisten they're gonna lose and they'regonna lose really badly in the fall it'sgonna be awful for them and then they'regoing to saythat it wasn't fair because Russiahacked our elective election againdoesn't that just piss you guys off Imean doesn't that it's like they want todeny that you exist they won't talk Ikeep saying this in interviews nobody'stalking to you they're talking about youthey're trying to pretend like you don'teven exist and that's the whole point ofthis campaign use your voice and make avideo and show them the truth of who youare and don't even allow them to eversay that you don't exist that you're notreal and that you don't have a voicethat mattersthat's why we're doing this so I lovethe video testament Eskimo Neos but I'mreally gonna ask you for that favor tostart doing I want to see more videotestimonials like a lot even if you'vealready written a testimonial make avideo I'm literally gonna ask everysingle member of this group to make avideo I mean let's see them refute thatthat'd be a hundred thousand videos canyou imaginetell me those are Russian BOTS a hundredthousand Russian bot videos I don'tthink sobut listen I really want to talk to youguys about

hello hello hashtag walk awayum my name is bobby fournier and ithought that i would just send a quickvideo out thereto tell you my story about um how andwhen i walked away from the democraticparty andi'm i'm just when i was youngerthe democratic party seemed to be thechoice it seemed to be thethe the right optionyou know for for the struggling you knowmiddle-class american and i neverrealized what was really going onunderneath the radar i never realizedwhat was going onum you know behind the scenes of thingsand uhand you know so from for most maybe thepast 20 years thethe presidencies that have that havehappened being predominantly democraticyou know i've alwaysi've always been kind of i've alwaysplaced myself somewhere in the centersome of the things i just didn't agreewith but mostly i would lean towardswhat they were trying to achieveand um and and so i felt like i maynot have been democratic but uh you knowleaning towards the democratic party andrepublican just you knowwasn't something that i i saw as as aviable optionwhen president trump became president umin 2016 or when he actually went to runfor presidency in 2015um i've actually followed mr trump forjust quite some time and you know know alot about him andyou know i looked up to him i thought hewas a you know a solidsolid guy as far as business wasconcerned and me being a businessindividualyou know i i really kind of uhvibed with them if you will so i took aninterest a more specific interest than iever havein any um and any anythingyou know in regards to uh politics andwhatnot you know typically it was justyou know do your vote do your thing youknowand uh and get it over with and now itwas it wasbecoming much more interesting to mebecause donald trump was running forpresidency so i had to see what wasgoing on i had to be much more involvedand in the process i fell into a youknow a rabbit holein in in this political reality that wefind ourselves inand i can i canhumbly say beyond the shadow of a doubtthat i am absolutely disgusted with thedemocratic partyand i swear i hope some of themwatch this and i'm not talking about thepeople who supportdemocrats those people have not hadtheir eyes open to the reality becausethey've been lied to i'm noti'm not you know referring to them thosepeoplethey need assistance you know gettingthe word to them so that their knowledgebecomes power and they can understandand seewhat i'm able to see and what so manyothers are starting to wake up and seewhen i say i hope a democrat watchesthis i mean the politiciansyou democrats who who act as if youare working for our best interest wheneverything you have saidover the past four years that i've beenlike closely watching everything hasbeena lie has been deceitful has beena way to divide our country has been away toto you know implement your agendaand it has nothing to do with americahas nothing to do with patriotismanymoreit has nothing to do with what ourconstitution stands for and representsand for that reason i've walked awayentirelyfrom the democratic party and i willnever turn back you haveshown your true colors the veal is offso to speakthe veil is off and i can see who youreallyare and i've never been more disgustedin a political party than i am of thedemocratic partyand i'm almost ashamed to say that atone point i leaned toward the democraticsidenow republican makes not only so muchsense but i see the patriotisminvolved in the republican way isee what they're about and i see thatit's what i want to be involved inand this is why i have decided to walkaway from the democratic party and ihave fullfull support for trump in 2020 as youcan see i have my gearon nothing makes sense that thedemocrats are trying to instill into ourminds nothingi'm an analytical individual i ipride myself and be able to being ableto look at a situation and assess it forwhat it truly isand i have to tell you i've never seensuch an intentionalact of disregard for our country as

hi I'm John capito and I wanted to shareto you my red tail moment so let me justgo back to 1990 my family came here inthe US before the 90s but me and mysisters that we came around you knowlike after 90s after 1990 back then myparents would only both Democrats forpresident funny enough they voted for aRepublican mayor and according to mymother life was great back then theywere active in politics so I figuredthey must know something good so Ifollowed their footsteps world eventsand politics ignorant I voted foraligned Democrats in 2008 boy that was abig mistake I thought I knew enough fromwatching the news in about George W Bushthere are things I didn't agree withlike when he went to Iraq or weapons ofmass destruction and found nothing ourenemies back then resides in Afghanistanand that I agree with but Iraq no Idon't agree with Don was saying at all Idon't support him I I don't I don't likebut our direct enemy at the time was AlQaeda and we should have concentrated onthem now let me get off my tangent so in2007 I was already thinking somethingneeds to break the status quo inWashington the spending is too muchwhich is directly related to the u.s.debt some of the problems some of theproblems was trade trade deficit Obamatalked about putting tariffs for Chinaso I thought that would do itand mccain said nothing nothing likelike that plus the media which i didn'tknow back then was a part was propagandanews keeps giving obama the air time andkeeps painting mccain as another georgew bush that was he said from me so Ivoted Obama in party line Obama didn'tpost terror for China but then Chinacountered with their own tariffs likewhat's happening nowexcept Trump is making the Chineseeconomy close to its collapse jobs backthen was cars but I get it's due to whathappened during the end of Bush era butwe should not be spending more eitherinstead we should cut back spending soObama spent a trillion dollars a yearduring a recession now common sensewould dictate to cut spending butwhatever honored the water now ja ahundred abridge water under the breath Icould never say that right jobs didn'tcome back so Obama gave welfare to makepeople give up give up looking for jobsthis way they don't need to be countedin the unemployment numbers they tellthey were tufted though in the laborforce participation rate but I don'tknow anybody else that looks at thatlike that other than me on top of thatlooking around me and the newsI see cops and military were vilified Isee the country is getting dividedthat's when I had my redtail moment Istill think somebody needs to take to doup to break the status go in WashingtonI knew Romney was not that guy but basedon what I've seen so far and what isabout to happen Obamacareand the individual mandate I knew Romneywas the better choice and then Trumpcame and I finally saw the soap thatcuts the swamp grease sure there arethings that he says are that arecringe-worthy but his policies hisactions are the one that spoke to me theloudest I am John kvitko and I walkedaway May 28 2007 thank you[Music]

hi everyone my name is Libby and I am areformed Democrat now don't get me wrongI am not prepared at this moment to saythat I am a conservative I prefer tothink of myself somewhere in the middlethis has been a rather traumatic journeyI think I say that lightly because I'msure other people have had differentexperiences but my walk away moment hasbeen happening probably since Trump waselected my husband and I have alwaysbeen Democrats I've always votedDemocrat straight down the ticketadmittedly I don't think that I havebeen as informed as I should have beenin the past going into the primaries ofthe most recent election my husband andI were Bernie supporters and after whathappened with Bernie and you know justthe more that came out about Clinton wejust couldn't support her now myhusband's journey took off a little bitfurther than mine did he is a navyveteran I would consider him aprogressive and in most circles and andmost of his ideals he has always beenserious about social justice and socialequality but he's also very concernedabout our economy immigration you knowthose types of policies and he is now afull-blown Trump supporter so if I cantake a step back because this is whathas been traumatic for me going fromstaunch Democrats to my husband nowbeing a registered Republican and atrump supporterit doesn't bother me what bothers me isthe hate and vitriol and the just thethe stupid name-calling the friends andfamily that I've lost a constant barrageof that all over social mediayou know people assuming that I havemarried a hateful homophobic racistmisogynist is life-altering it's hurtfuland that has been the biggest catalystfor my walk away moment like I said I Idon't feel comfortable calling myself aconservative I have not changed my partyI am still a registered Democrat and Ithink that we have to be careful withyou know making a distinction betweenliberalism and being a Democrat becauseI feel like where things have reallyfallen apart is in the Democratic Partynot in liberalism I still believe inthose ideals so I think it's importantto make that distinction and while I'mnot comfortable calling myself aconservative I am comfortable callingmyself a liberal because I feel like Iam a liberal but I do not feel part ofthe Democratic Party any longer and it'sa shame I feel like I don't belonganywhere I feel like I'm afraid to youknow voice any opinions that are againstor at least not aligned with mainstreamDemocrats and I don't like living infear it's no way to liveit's no way to live and and I have to behonest when I just say that my world hasbeen flipped upside down over this overthis hate eye my eyes are opened to justhow fair-weathered the people in my lifereally are and that's a sad sad momentvery sadanyway I really appreciate this movementbecause you know I don't know that Ibelong a hundred percent because I dostill identify as a liberal and I'm nota conservative but I really appreciateyou know the idea that it's okayyou know to to walk away and and thatthere is a group of people that you knowhave gone through the same things that Ihave and so I appreciate the support inthat regard so keep up the good fightand who knows who knows what the futurewill hold but I really hope that youknow more people can find this outletand can feel comfortable you know notbeing part of the status quoyou

hi fellow walkaways my name is JenniferAlvey I am coming to you from ChandlerArizona in between some car pools for myfive kids but I wanted to share anexperience like many of you I grew up ina proud 3/4 generation Democrat familyunlike probably some of you I actuallystarted walking away from the Democratsabout 20 years ago at the end of thelate 1990s it's about the only time inmy life where I've been early foranythingI was concerned at the time aboutPresident Clinton perjuring himself theinvestigation wasn't exactly something Iwas thrilled about I think it's a fairargument that you know it was apolitically based investigation into himbut when he perjured himself under oathand then he wasn't removed from officeby the Senate which was primarilyDemocrat members that really concernedme here we had the highest electedofficial in our land ignoring our rulesof law for political purpose and so atthat point I thought this is where thisparty is going I can't be a part of thatand I think it's more important to standup for the role of law and to do what'sright even if it means that you know wehad a different replacement and it wouldhave become a President Gore so that wasmy first reason for walking away mysecond reason for walking away was againin the late 1990s I was working fulltime and I kept hearing the Democratssay you know women need us to fight forthem minorities need us to fight forthem and I looked around and I thoughtyou know a lot of those conditions thathad in the past really been roadblocksand unfair barriers they didn't existanymore thankfully our country had comepast them and at that point it wassimply about every individual havingfull access to all opportunitybut I looked around my office and Ithought you know I'm in an office oftwo-thirds of these people working orwomen including the leadership roles wehad my first office our chief of staffwas a woman in my second office our CEOwas a minority woman and I thought youknow these challenges that we didlegitimately have in the past andthankfully then cleaned up pretty prettywell institutionally at least and thisparty is still promoting the idea thatwe haven't moved forward when my feltthat we had and that really concerned meto see a political party generating itsown reasons to exist instead of doingwhat I felt was best for all Americansso at that point I ended up walking awayI did vote third party in 2016 I hadconcerns about both of the candidatesbut I've been so horrified and sodisgusted by how the media has treatedPresident Trump since he came in officeand by extension all my fellow Americanswho voted for him and who have justbasically acted like that didn't matterwe know what's best for you we being themedia we the media are gonna tell youwhat you should think about this we asAmericans are resilient we are smart weknow how to sniff out a scam andunderstand that we don't want what themedia is trying to sell us we're notinterestedwe believe in our rules of law webelieve in helping each other we believethat America has tremendousopportunities and that we genuinely needto help those of us who are our fellowAmericans who can't help ourselvesthat's fine but America is not aterrible horrible place it's an amazingplace so I grew up as a Democrat I amnow and have been for over a decade andregistered Republican but first andforemost I am an American and I believein our American rules of law I believein our American opportunities and Ibelieve in my fellow American- as a group want to do the right thingso I really appreciate the walkawaymovement Brandon thank you so much foreverything you've done to bring ustogether I'm really looking forward tohopefully getting to meet you whenyou're here at the end of October I'mdefinitely gonna be going to theHalloween gala and hope to shake yourhand and tell you thank you foreverything you've done to give us thisopportunity to come together and supporteach other as walkaways so thank you myfellow Americans and my fellow walkwaysI appreciate this opportunity to sharetake care of a bike[Music]

okay so I've been part of this group fora while now and I really loved readinglistening to everyone's story I've kindof refrained from posting one myselfbecause as you can probably tell by Maxand I'm British but I thought since its4th of July I thought I'd share mywalkaway story so despite my nationalityI've always really loved the UnitedStates I'm actually trying to visit all50 states I'm currently on 34 I'm only25 which is so I'm doing and even parpar the Declaration of Independencetattooed on my back on my on my leftshoulder here um I have a full copy ofit in my corridor the coat you can seeon my wall there is from Abraham Lincolnabout the better angels of our naturefrom the Gettysburg Address and I evenhave an American flag on my door whicheverything here you can see my Americanflag on the door there as welland yeah so you might think me doingthis as a having all this as a Brit iskind of strange and that's kind of whatI why I wanted to put a video heretalking to you so for me I had all theUnited States I love it the valuesmainly freedom of speech and freedom ofexpression here our government is comingdown on that a lot which is prettypretty bloody tragic ahem but we werenever really sort of taught an Americanhistory school high school and slice orstudied American politics in history inmy own time outside of my engineeringdegree and outside of my job so pastseven years or so and as a result I kindof I'd always admire people like ThomasJefferson I still do but I was alwaysreally a huge fan of JFK his commentsand things like think think not whatyour country can do for you but what youcan do for your countryit always resonated reloads andinstilled us today despite my politicalleanings but when a cigar is politicsparticularly American politics I waswhat you guys would call a liberal whenthe left was a liberal I love JohnOliver The Young Turks which I'm reallyhate to say and Bill Maher and allI do still watch Bill Maher and despitethe fact he's not really sticking into alot of his principles as much now and intimes can just be as bad as the rest theleft at times not always and I come thelonger I watched and listenedparticularly with John Oliverit was so one-sided to the point I couldI can start to see such a blatant floorsuch as things like deliberatelymisconstrue in the arguments breezingover the other side of the argumentbeing like oh by the way hate this onething that might be relevant theargument but I'm gonna keep going withwhat I'm talking aboutand it was so exaggerated and soblatantly one-sided it just thought thisthis just isn't right it's not I wasalways brought at the school to look atboth sides of the arguments um and atthat age I didn't really do a lot ofthat myself I didn't force myself to dothat well the media is consumingobviously a lot of the films and andmainstream media was listening to wasall just bombarding me with the same sawleftist narrative so I kind of startedto watch other political commentatorsand shows I stopped I discovered benshapiro i'm sure most of you willundoubtedly know and it felt like he wasjust speaking my language in terms ofresponsibility civil discourse gave me amassive different cultural view one uponthe united states that i guess idespite being there so many times ofhaving visited so many states that i'venever really thought about as muchalready had considered which was kind ofstrange and kind of worried me a bitthat I hadn't experienced that and Ijust I disagree with him on a couplethings and but a lot of what he andothers says kind of made me questioneverything I thought I knew even when Ilisten to me by steven crowder I'd neverreally we don't get a lot ofconservative comment comedians hereeither so that was a big plus and I wasactually kind of really desperate tofind out people at Beth Shapiro wrong Iwas I was determined to do my researchand just like yeah this guy can't beright this stuff can't be right andactually had fun I was wrong and and I'mlaughing now because it's ridiculousit's ridiculous I never even considerthat the half a country obviously youthink oh they're wrong well they know Iobviously you'd think why then why wouldhalf the country vote for these peopleif they were wrongand through doing so respect especiallybecause I was so interested in Americanpolitics history um I found out aboutthe Democratic Party's racist historyand on all their failures which I justnever heard about obviously admiring JFKand Polly LBJ afterwards it was it kindof seemed didn't seem realisticrealistic too to criticize or to to eventhink what did they do wrong and yeahit's even the great thing shoot they'regoing shooting for example in the UnitedStates learning about guns about theSecond Amendment if you if you'd haveasked me a couple of years ago I'd neverreally have even considered the otherargument on the Second Amendment and I'dwatch my life combine so as you canimagine kinda got sucked into the wholeMichael Moore spiel and that was partlybecause I knew nothing about guns aswell I'd used a couple here in Englandbut nothing nothing major still in avery controlled environment in thecountryside shooting clay pigeonsso obviously using things like an ar-15and and like a forty seven and some moreso a larger weaponry never reallythought about why somebody would needthat and I'm still a bit mixed on thetopic but but it still it was it wasventuring into the unknown for me andand even so you guys know we had brexithere but even prereqs in pre Trump theleft had just kind of descended intokind of sheer ignorance really a lot ofhatred and intolerance for any view butthemselves of their own their own viewand for me I was liberal but that seemsso illiberal it was completely theopposite of what kind of values I hadand I hold dear so because he was socontradictory I just I found it pushingme away actually even dated it somebodyand things were great but but as soon asyou started talking about politics andthings like that she she stopped seeingme because I wanted loads lower taxesand because I was criticizing theidentitarian on the Left I think thereare a lot of good people still on theleft and however it was more theidentitarian side which I wascriticizing and it baffled me this umbut having a different opinion maymater's I think no I'm Darla don't wantto date you and and itit just pushed me towards moreconservative ideas if anything I startedreading more Thomas ol Milton Friedmanand I've never thought about freedomfrom an economic point of view and onlyever thought about it from I don't knowlike a rights and social point of viewso things like criticizing the minimumwage here in England that just goes downlike a dead bullet like a lead balloonbut it's it's important because I neverwould have even considered thosearguments before I would never eventhought that where would the validitywould be in those arguments so I read alisten to some more conservatives orstanding up freedom and it was it waskind of weird because looking back andlooking back on all videos and thingsthey kind of always had been and I wasjust obviously as everybody wasbombarded with Republicans are evil youknow and I wish I never listened um nowI listen to people like Dan Crenshaw andRand Paul and I just think what the hellwas I thinking this is the samenarrative as it was kind of goingthrough the past couple years and I justignored it because I was told thesepeople that are more evil one or willjust have bad interests at heartso even when I've been to the UnitedStates I've been trying to visit everystate but when I went to Texas in thesouth as a result it meant I stereotypedpeople thinking loads of people would besort of backward and racist rednecks youknow the whole the whole lot and when Ishould people of like they were friendlythey were just the most welcoming peopleand great people and I love going backto the south and to Texas Texas myfavorite state um and I realized whatthe left had done to me in terms ofprejudging people without any I havenever met met them never experienced ina quarter and what they're like and Imean it made me really sad so um 20southerners I'm really sorry forthinking okay at least now I've left theleft but people across America they getsuch bad coverage over here and in othercountries and from the mainstream mediaand so every time I come over to UnitedStates it's just great that you guyscompletely smashed the narrative andyou're always really lovely welcoming tome and I really appreciate thatso so now I'm a libertarian um Iprobably notice proton for some of youbut I I'm glad I can now say prettypraising what he's doing something rightand and kritis silk idolize me what he'sdoing something wrongbut it meant I were not an ideologueI can criticize and I'm just knock thisleftist narrative of oh I must thinkthis certain way and it feels liberatedum I actually went to a trump rally inCalifornia as a sort of neutral party in2016 and when he'd secured theRepublican nomination and the democraticprocess us outside were hurling insultsof physical objects they were channeisto start fighting were being veryviolence and I was in this queue with abunch of Trump supportersI know it's lovely there was justloveliest people and it really that likeman again completely smashed mynarrative I just thought these guys makeit loads of bad press coverage but lookof those Democratic support was overthere having to be held back by loads ofpolice officers just to hear this guyspeak it was it was madness so thatreally did blow the Narus ever have himon Trump as well so it wasn't justobviously Republicans but obviously wasTrump as a different phenomenon and Ikind of want to bring this background towhat today's all about because for metoday is about freedom it's about whygood ideas always prevail and 1 p.m. howwhen people stand up for the motton thepower that can have so it's why I as aBritish guy can be talking to you withpar the Declaration of Independencetattooed on my back you know and andcelebrate the 4th of July because it'sabout celebrating freedom that wasearned through brave individuals whostood up for freedom and the rights thatallow them to exercise those freedoms tothis day it's why I really enjoy listento what you guys have to say andeveryone has to say about their ownpersonal experience and how it'sdifferent

hi fellow walkaways my name is JenniferAlvey I am coming to you from ChandlerArizona in between some car pools for myfive kids but I wanted to share anexperience like many of you I grew up ina proud 3/4 generation Democrat familyunlike probably some of you I actuallystarted walking away from the Democratsabout 20 years ago at the end of thelate 1990s it's about the only time inmy life where I've been early foranythingI was concerned at the time aboutPresident Clinton perjuring himself theinvestigation wasn't exactly something Iwas thrilled about I could think it's afair argument that you know it was apolitically based investigation into himbut when he perjured himself under oathand then he wasn't removed from officeby the Senate which was primarilyDemocrat members that really concernedme here we had the highest electedofficial in our land ignoring our rulesof law for political purpose and so atthat point I thought this is where thisparty is going I can't be a part of thatand I think it's more important to standup for the role of law and to do what'sright even if it means that you know wehad a different replacement and it wouldhave become a President Gore so that wasmy first reason for walking away mysecond reason for walking away was againin the late 1990s I was working fulltime and I kept hearing the Democratssay you know women need us to fight forthem minorities need us to fight forthem and I looked around and I thoughtyou know a lot of those conditions thathad in the past really been roadblocksand unfair barriers they didn't existanymore thankfully our country had comepast them and at that point it wassimply about every individual havingfull access to all opportunitybut I looked around my office and Ithought you know I'm in an office oftwo-thirds of these people working therewomen including the leadership roles wehad my first office our chief of staffwas a woman in my second office our CEOwas a minority woman and I thought youknow these challenges that we didlegitimately have in the past havethankfully been cleaned up pretty prettywell institutionally at least and thisparty is still promoting the idea thatwe haven't moved forward when my feltthat we had and that really concerned meto see a political party generating itsown reasons to exist instead of doingwhat I felt was best for all Americansso at that point I ended up walking awayI did vote third party in 2016 I hadconcerns about both of the candidatesbut I've been so horrified and sodisgusted by how the media has treatedPresident Trump since he came in officeand by extension all my fellow Americanswho voted for him and who have justbasically acted like that didn't matterwe know what's best for you we being themedia we the media are gonna tell youwhat you should think about this we asAmericans are resilient we are smart weknow how to sniff out a scam andunderstand that we don't want what themedia is trying to sell us we're notinterestedwe believe in our rules of law webelieve in helping each other we believethat America has tremendousopportunities and that we genuinely needto help those of us who are our fellowAmericans who can't help ourselvesthat's fine but America is not aterrible horrible place it's an amazingplace so I grew up as a Democrat I amnow and have been for over a decade andregistered Republican but first andforemost I am an American and I believein our American rules of law I believein our American opportunities and Ibelieve in my fellow American- as a group want to do the right thingso I really appreciate the walkawaymovement Brandon thank you so much foreverything you've done to bring ustogether I'm really looking forward tohopefully getting to meet you whenyou're here at the end of October I'mdefinitely going to be going to theHalloween gala and hope to shake yourhand and tell you thank you foreverything you've done to give us thisopportunity to come together and supporteach other as walkaways so thank you myfellow Americans and my fellow walkwaysI appreciate this opportunity to sharetake care of a bike[Music]

hi everybody my name is Jennifer and Ilive in Wyoming I have been followingthe walk away movement now for aboutseven to eight months and initially Ijust kind of put a picture in a littlebit of myself when I first came on thesite and I was I was amazed at how thesupport system was just incredible andhow I was learning these amazing storiesand these amazing histories andbackgrounds from people from all walksof life all ethnicities all backgroundsand I just absolutely loved that and Iam probably what you and consider a walkwith I definitely have been conservativemy whole life I live in Wyoming I'm aChristian I you know we raise ourchildren with Christian values butbeyond that one of the things that Iloved the most about first finding thissite in getting the support is how manypeople were in even my shoes where allof a sudden friends that you had had fora lifetime 10 20 30 years were turningon me and we were no longer friendsthey were disappearing on Facebooksimply because of my belief systems andbecause I would not just kowtow and bendto their willwhich Mannino it was the weirdest thingever it's not like we can haveconversations anymore it's like we needto have this conversation and you haveto turn into a liberal in order for usto have this conversation any furtherand if not then you are a bigotedbigoted or a homophobe or racist and Ijust that is so beyond ridiculous andand so I where I'm going with that is Ifelt like this has been just an amazingsupport system for anybody that has feltthat feeling of just like you've almostbeen had been stripped of your humanityand just your ability to care for otherpeople and see people as a human beingwith feelingand a personality and opinions andfreedom of thought and speech and Ithink the reason I feel led to post avideo now is because of all of thethings that we are seeing with YouTubeand Twitter and Facebook and just thecensorship of the conservative voicesand one of the things that I havelearned the most from watching a lot ofyour videos is how important it is nowmore than ever not to stay silent Ithink for a long time the Liberals werevery good about keeping us quiet becausewe did want to be humane we did want totalk to people rationally and logicallyand and because we did not want to beevil back we did not want to be violencewe just stayed quiet and they got usedto that and so I think as we start tosee our voices being heard more and morethat censorship is going to happen moreand more and so the only way to combatthat is for more of us to be out therebeing vocal and saying what needs to besaid because there's people that arestill on the fence there's people thatare starting to wake up but they'rescared and they don't want to move andyou know maybe it's a video that I makeor that you make or something that youpost or say or a comment like whathappened with Brandon makes everydifference in the world for that oneperson to be given their thoughts backto be able to think again for themselvesand feel that sense of peace that inyourself that you can be who you are whoyou have been all along and and so I'mlearning that arguing does not helphowever there are places that I thinkthat that there are there's commonground on and if we can find thoseplaces whatever those might be to buildon that might be a platform in which tohave an actual decenthuman conversation logical realisticconversation free of emotion and vitrioland victimhood of the people that we aretrying to to love on honestly we'retrying to love on them because we wantthem to think we want them to go andeducate themselves we're not tellingthem what's the thing we don't want themto think what we think we want them tothink for themselves and we want to helpthem hopefully get there and so I'veI've started being more bold postingthings that maybe I wouldn't have postedbefore because they might be a tiny bitcontroversial but maybe not likehorribly controversial or maybe they'refrom a site or a resource that's not 100percent conservative commentator or foxor something like that it's more of likemiddle-of-the-road where some of thoseliberals will like instantly look atthose posts and be like of course Foxsays that of course ben shapiro saysthat or whatever and i i'm learning thatyou know when we can find thosemiddle-of-the-roadcommentators i think it helps a littlebit especially when you have voices thatwere liberals before and they have cometo a place where they can think againfor themselves and whatever that may bemaybe it's not republican that's totallyfine just that they're thinking againfor themselves and they're actuallyeducating themselves in theirresearching and they're not just takingthat pill of the mainstream media newsand so i just i thought i would sharethat that that's been really helpful tomake me more bold as listening to yourstories and coming up with those greatideas that all of you have done whereyou're trying to find some of thoseplaces of common ground where instead ofjust being hit with a wall of hate youhave someone saying hey that's actuallykind of a decent point let's we canagree on thatlike i'm pretty sure most everybody canagree that the the first lady of theunited states is the attack that happensto her on a daily basis is ridiculousand it would have never happenedif it was Michelle Obama and I'm justI'm done I'm sick of it I just thinkit's ridiculous and the things she'sdoing for kidsan educator and so the things theprogram she has for four children isamazing her passion is amazing and sothat's one area where I've actuallyfound that regardless of what style sideof the aisle there's a lot of peoplethat actually agree with that that she'sunder attack for really no reason otherthan being married to Trump but when youcan find those areas I think it's aplace to start it doesn't mean that youhave to give up what your thoughtprocess is it doesn't mean that you haveto bend on what you believe but it is aplace to start so anyways I have to getto a soccer game I'm a soccer momapparently and I I just want to thankyou all for listening to me and I'm justbeing a support system I love watchingyour videos whenever I'm feeling reallydiscouraged the first thing I do isthere watch walkaway videos and it'sbeen an important step in my journey sothanks to everybody and God bless[Music]hi everybody my name is Jennifer

this is my follow-up video I wanted totalk about how things have changed forme since I walked away from theDemocratic Party these are prettyexciting times for me in the sense thatI'm no longer afraid I live in a veryliberal city that is San Francisco andthings are very extreme here when itcomes to politics I mean really reallyfar left and they are everywhere so ithasn't exactly been easy for me in thebeginning they try to brainwash me andturn me into one of them so that I wouldact like them think like them and jobwell done I did conform it seemed nearlyimpossible not to in this bubble whereeverybody act the same and things thesame but I didn't handle it very well Iwas anxious 24/7 I couldn't speak up godforbid I disagree with them on anythingwhatever I said was somehow offensivejust non-stop I am so happy that I'm nowpart of the walkway movement becausethis is what gave me the courage tofinally stand up for myself and sayenough is enough I have a good person Idon't

deserve to be treated like thiswhy am I being called a racist Nazi forno reason those words have meaning theydon't bully me anymore because I won'tlet them of course they so try to ofcourse there is still verbal abuseemotional abuse I've been called everyname in the dictionary and not in thedictionary and it's been happening sotimes that it just doesn't affect meanymore I've already heard it all thereis no surprises hereaccording to Loftus I shouldn't even bea part of the walkaway movement becausewell I'm from Russia and they like tosay that walk away is run by theRussians so I guess I just can't be hereanymore leftists are straight updiscriminating against Russians becauseof their nationality and then they goahead and tell people not todiscriminate against others based ontheir nationality I need a second to letthe hypocrisy waft over me and then whenI disagree with leftiststhey see things like go back to Russiawhat happened I thought they likedimmigrants or is it just the illegalones they get to stay not going anywherehalf of my wife I spent just dreaming ofbeing right here I had to jump throughhoops of fire to enter this country Iwaited four years I filled out

until I metone in the airport when I landed inAmerica againI was 18 transgender people I had tolook it up wasn't sure what it meantyou'll never see this in Russia so whenI moved here I was mind blown andleftist looking at the very same pictureare only seeing the negative stuffthey'll only talk about racism anddiscrimination and racism and did Imention discrimination and by that Imean you look at somebody the wrong wayand that's just ityou're racist I'd love to invite them tothe country to down front and see howthey'd survived there for a little bitwith this kind of attitude because trustme when I tell you they'd come backrunning they'd be kissing the groundthey don't know how good they have itbecause they have nothing to compare itto no way that they acting like thisthey talk about

so hello fellow walk away pitches Ithought I would take the opportunity inresponse to Brandon to make a videobecause apparently we are washing boxaccording to the left you know and Iguess the video is hard to dispute so mypersonal walkaway story naturally begana very long time ago going on almost 20years now when I first came to theUnited States from Africa Nigeriaspecifically to be a college and at thattime you know sort of first off you knowboth if you will as a student in theUnited States it quickly became apparentto me that university professors had aparticular worldview a particular way ofunderstanding the world seeing the worldand slowly over time there a particularview of the world which naturally mostuniversities today began to become myown right so I slowly began to think andperceive the world through the lens ofmy professors right it never occurred tome at the time that these were notreally thoughts I had really thoughtthrough or I hadn't come to conclusionsthat were my own over the course of timeI began to realize that much of thearguments that were being made bystudents that were protesting everythingfrom the environment to the 2000elections it didn't quite matter whatthe particular issue was they were neverreally making arguments right there moreoften than not resorted to name-callingand the entire foundation of theirprotest or their the things they werelooking to voice we're actually justreally basedmotions and on how they wanted the worldto be what universe always I'm a badthing it's just I never heard argumentsright I've had any kind of intellectualfoundation or things that had mooringsto rationality you know an even worsethough over time he slowly began tooccur to me that a lot of theintolerance in the hate a lot of thevitriol was on the side of the porticoleft and so I would say that the firstthing that clued me into you know my ownpart in this sort of leftist way ofthinking was I was watching the lake TimRussert on MSNBC and he was interviewinghistorian by the name of DavidMcCullough and David made a statementthat has always stuck with me right hesaid that if you live in a society or acivilization and you know nothing of itshistory right and this is beyond justsuperficial knowledge but if you knownothing of the history of a society ofwhich you are apart you will inevitablywalk around with the outlook of a childright and this was a very gooddefinition of sort of Maya it waschildishI could not articulate why I believedthe things that I did the things Ichanted and quite honestly it occurredto me that I did not really knowanything I didn't know in and so I begana journey to will be studying history indepth and became a big fan of thestudents of history and as I studiedhistoryI quickly began to realize that themodern American left-right have a lot oftheir intellectual foundation in theMarxist of the last century right youknow Ronald Reagan once said that iffascism came to America that is the comein the name of liberalism you know and Ido this because I recognize that thereare classical liberals in the universeand actually share a lot of their way ofthinking right in classical liberalismis something that I distinguish frommodern leftists if you will you knowsomeone who's done a very fine jobarticulating classical liberalism wouldbe Dave Rubin of the Rubin report youshould look him up average is doing finework right but the modern American leftand leftist ideology if you will it'salmost like a religion it's not justhere at home right but its global aswell and and the forces that are on themarch today globallyare the forces that are acting againstfreedom against individual isn't rightyou know the ability and the capacity ofthe individual to be the source fromwhich all truth comes from if you willright as opposed to collectivism whichhas a lot of dogma that the moment youdeviate from you are ostracized you'recalled names and in some ways you'repersecuted for itI've often find ironic among my ownfamily members that for 20 years even myown brother I don't know that it's everactually occurred to them you know thata lot of being tolerant and a lot of thehate speech comes from the left rightand the irony of it is they've done thissort of bait and switch sort of thing inthe United States where they constantlypointed to the other side as the side ofthe tolerance and the side of racism youknow and so on and all the isms outthere but there's a growing movementthat is I think a bigger sort of storyand I think the walkaway movement is apart of this larger movement ofAmericans that are realizing that lookour ultimate strength as a society asanother civilization doesn't similar toderive from our diversity right as a asa as it derives from our ability asmillions of people of diversebackgrounds of diversityreligions and whatnot to forge anAmerican identity out of that diversityright that's really where Americanstrength comes from and what the modernleft ultimately I think is seeking toundo much of the American Revolution youknow I had to find my and arguesomething some things along these linesor something and I feel they agree withthem you know that the left is lookingto undo the American Revolution but thischallenge is not just here it's here andabroad you know all of us Europe this isa this is an ongoing challenge and soBrandon I want to just thank you for thecourage it took to begin this right andfor all of you who are out there youknow the question for me is where do wego from here and I consider myself oneof you and for starters I would say weshould never resort to the kind ofname-callingthe kind of animosity that those on theLeft often show us right there are justas trapped in this sort of mental thingright as many of us banks were you knowand we weren't forced or insulted out ofour sort of deception like however ourown individual stories are I highlydoubt that any of us would really say wewere forced out of that or exalted outof it right it was little things thatbegan the unraveling for us right manyof us it's realizing that a lot of beingtolerance was from the side of you knowthat says they are the fallen one and soon and so forth and so when I thinkabout where we go from hereat the moment I'm kind of formulating alot of my own thoughts along those linesbut I do know this that we need torealize that you cannot cast out hatethe hate right and that you have to showkindness and actually love right whereyou are insulted where you aremistreated because someday they willrealize that the intolerance is reallybeing on their side and as more and morepeople come out of that they need tofind a place and have a place just likewe are finding you know to come to soplease let us not resort to the samekind of social medianame-calling that is just you know Imean the Internet is replete with thisstuff right and I don't want any one ofus that have come out and have walkedaway to resort to the same games youknow and then secondly I think we allneed to continue to grow in oureducation of what it means to beAmerican right and we need to grow ineach of our abilities to articulate whyindividualism and freedom is really theonly hope for the future right you knowbecause we need to learn how to winargument you know Margaret Thatcher Iused to say the first to win theargument and then you win the vote so Iwant all of us who are walking away togrow in our ability to articulate rightwhy we believe what we believe you knowand to respond in kindness and in lovetowards the other side because I'mhopeful you know I did not vote forDonald Trump in the 2016 electionsneither did my wife but I can say this Iam very much looking forward to votingfor the man in 24 simply because whatwould he stand but yeah I mean not likea couple of things here and there thathe says what that's not really relevantthere are bigger issues at hand in hispresidency I believe means above allthings in my mind the genesis of thebeginning of sort of breaking the backof the skirt of intimidation right thathas had sway in this country for thelast twenty years thirty years and it'sgotten worse right and that's what Ithink is presidency Stanthat political correctness is a farworse bondage to being right and that weeach need to recognize that it takescourage to stand up to be counted and tosay that we are drawing a lineunderstand we need to be free to be whowe are to think what we think right andthe muzzling of the left is somethingthat has to be defeated and so our enemyaren't the people that are trapped inthis right it is the ideas and

it's realizing that a lot of beingtolerance was from the side of you knowthat says they are the fallen one and soon and so forth and so when I thinkabout where we go from hereat the moment I'm kind of formulating alot of my own thoughts along those linesbut I do know this that we need torealize that you cannot cast out hatethe hate right and that you have to showkindness and actually love right whereyou are insulted where you aremistreated because someday they willrealize that the intolerance is reallybeing on their side and as more and morepeople come out of that they need tofind a place and have a place just likewe are finding you know to come to soplease let us not resort to the samekind of social medianame-calling that is just you know Imean the Internet is replete with thisstuff right and I don't want any one ofus that have come out and have walkedaway to resort to the same games youknow and then secondly I think we allneed to continue to grow in oureducation of what it means to beAmerican right and we need to grow ineach of our abilities to articulate whyindividualism and freedom is really theonly hope for the future right you knowbecause we need to learn how to winargument you know Margaret Thatcher Iused to say the first to win theargument and then you win the vote so Iwant all of us who are walking away togrow in our ability to articulate rightwhy we believe what we believe you knowand to respond in kindness and in lovetowards the other side because I'mhopeful you know I did not vote forDonald Trump in the 2016 electionsneither did my wife but I can say this Iam very much looking forward to votingfor the man in 24 simply because whatwould he stand but yeah I mean not likea couple of things here and there thathe says what that's not really relevantthere are bigger issues at hand in hispresidency I believe means above allthings in my mind the genesis of thebeginning of sort of breaking the backof the skirt of intimidation right thathas had sway in this country for thelast twenty years thirty years and it'sgotten worse right and that's what Ithink is presidency Stanthat political correctness is a farworse bondage to being right and that weeach need to recognize that it takescourage to stand up to be counted and tosay that we are drawing a lineunderstand we need to be free to be whowe are to think what we think right andthe muzzling of the left is somethingthat has to be defeated and so our enemyaren't the people that are trapped inthis right it is the ideas and thespirit behind this idea that got all theenemy if there isn't if there is such athing just once they Thank You Brandonand I'm very excited that this ishappening and I'm grateful to be a partof it table

hi everyone my name is Lisa and myhusband Rick and I were at the March inthe rally this past weekend and we hadheard Brandon asked that if you werethere to make a video and tell you whatthe weekend meant to you so here's myvideo we had actually joined the walkaway page and the movement when it waskind of young I think there was about1500 people on the page at that point soit was like right in like July and/orJune and I originally made a videobefore the walk away back then myhusband died both our walk widths we areconservatives but this was so importantto us to be at and I don't know how toexplain the weekend except for it wasenergetic it was but I guess the word Ikeep thinking I was dynamic it wasabsolutely dynamic and phenomenal wewere not able to go the gala but we werethere on Saturday morning because thereabout 11 o'clock there were two peopleat the park got to hear the speakersbefore the for the March met so manypeople and it was just an air of loveand peace and joythere was no negativity at all theentire weekend the only thing you heardall day Saturday and including the brushthat we went to on Sunday is twoquestions I will walk with or walk awayand where are you fromwe met people all over the confrim allover the country um all races gendersreligions we didn't even know whatpeople were didn't care it was namedlike hey you know you're from Texas youknow you could tell the people that werefrom the south because they were toldbecause it was rainy and cold that dayum but the brother didn't get anybodydown everybody was so energized and itwas it was just a really wonderful dayand then we were able to do the Marchand that was absolutely phenomenalpeople were honking their horns insupport of us did not hear anybody likeno negativity and then the rally aftertheI think I heard a couple of protestersyelling but maybe that was itand I think it lasted for maybe like 20seconds you know really I think thepolice did a phenomenal job bikers forTrump did a phenomenal job that we gotto hear so many fantastic speakers andthere was a moment we were near thestage and it was just for Brendan wasgonna go on and we're watching Brandonwatch his video and he teared up and itwas just so incredibly sweet to see thatyou know it's like I don't it looks likehe didn't realize that this would besuch a big movement you know that theywere able to put this together first ofall thank you to the coordinators and toBrandon's team because it was absolutelyphenomenal it was so well done we did goto the brunch on Sunday which I was soexcited about I love dinesh d'souzagotten to hear him speak was fantasticand then we had an extra hour for thethe room and Brandon asked people tocome in and you know the othertestimonies of what the weekend meant tothem unfortunately we had to leavearound quarter to twelve because we hada train to catch but he did I heardBrendan say that there was a youngtransgender woman that came up and Ibelieve we actually met her at thebeginning rally before the March and shesaid that although she felt was like hesaid that she had said she would I feltlike acceptance in love and peace andthat's what the whole weekend was nowyou see all these protests on TV andthey're all negative and violent andthere was absolutely nothing like thatthere was absolutely no negativity theentire weekend and that's what struck meas you

this might be the most important videothat I've ever done I'm talking topeople who are participating in the newmovement that you're seeing on Twitterand possibly on Facebookhashtag walk away and I need you to payattention to what I'm about to saybecause not only are you doing somethingvery brave but you may not know whatyou're walking into[Music]what's up everybody it's your boy wanteasy with the Chrysler Kratz and the redpill reality and this video that I'mdoing right now is probably going to bethe most important video that I've doneto date I really would appreciate it ifyou guys are watching would share thiswould send this video to who it mayapply to it's gonna be very importantthe things that I'm gonna say so I wantyou to maybe take a listen and see whatmaybe you can glean out of what I'mabout to say here so we've seen in thelast week and a half maybe last week orso on Twitter and on Facebook and someof the other social media outlets thatthere is a movement going on calledhashtag walk awayhashtag walk away and what that is isthat there are people who aretraditionally liberals or who identifiedas a Democrat who were moderateDemocrats moderate liberals who haveseen the shenanigans of the LiberalParty the Democrats and the you know thelast year two years they've justspiraled out of control with theirrhetoric and their anger and the vitriolthat has gone past the pale beyond thepale of what it what does anything civilyes there have been times on the on theopposite end of the spectrumconservatives have said things and callfor things that were not right but itwasn't a party wide thing it wasn't athing that was happening withinfluencers on the regular and it justseems it like your your typical outletson the Left CNN MSNBC Washington Postall of Hollywood all of the nighttimetalk show host comedians actors just allof the airwaves have the spun out ofcontrol to the point where they'recalling for violence and people are notcondemning it only a couple of peopleare condemning it but you know so thewalk away movement has started becausepeople are just fed up you knowgood-hearted good-natured people whohave goodengines who may identify with one or twothings of the the liberal ideology orleftist ideology and don't know wherethe essence of it comes from and havingthought through that are beginning tosee that wait a minute that they don'trepresent me anymore I need to get awayfrom them and they're walking away so onone hand I congratulate you that it'scongratulations from my heart heartfeltcongratulations on seeing what was rightin front of you seeing like how howvitriolic has gotten an understandingthat that doesn't match up with yourpersonal ideology that's what personalchoice is all about and you've seen ityou have the bravery to walk away fromitI want to give you a little bit of quicklittle history to let you know whatyou're actually walking away from theliberal mentality if you go back and theleftist which is better said the leftistmentality is something that tells you atits core that government gives you yourrights as a human being that there is noparticular God that we adhere to thatgives us our rights it is the governmentand the government is the one thatshould divvy out what is right andwhat's wrong and it tells you that samething and you are to follow that whatthat what the government says and willgive you out your individual rights aswell depending on what we feel iscorrect and you know if it is if it's athing where we feel like the top 1%because of what we feel is making toomuch and they're not going along withwhat we want we take it away from themand we'll give it to who we deem itnecessary now at the end of the day ifyou follow the rabbit fall down therabbit hole you're gonna find out thatnow listen to what I'm sayingDemocrat and Republican are and theircore and from the origin of things notthey're on the same teamand the push and move towards globalismin this world is what is the at mostdanger but I digress here that's it foranother video so you've walked away fromyou know probably very scary thing - doyou not know what you're coming to whatyou're going toward because you've beentold or your life that a conservativedoesn't care about people a conservativeis only for the richyou've been drilled that into your headand I'm here to tell you that that's nottrue that's not a truth at all well trueconservative of the conservatism orright is is the at the core the beliefthat our rights come from God and ifthose rights come from God that meansthat they cannot be changed and that'severy one every human being every humanbeing has those rights that come fromGod and we figure out what those rightsare by what is in God's nation you knowwe have the right to live we have theright to defend ourselves because we areindividual entities that can makedecisions for ourselves we have theright to be free because we are made inthe image of God that is the make nomistakes about it that is the bedrock ofconservatism and quote unquote being onthe right in America that is why Americawas founded that's why America you knowevolved in the way that it has that'sway that's the reason why Americaeventually abolished slavery withinourselves we had a civil war in part todeal with that that's why America is awelcoming of what no matter what theytry to tell you or welcoming of legalimmigration to come here and do thingsthe right way you know that's why thiscountry you come here to and you workhard and generally you can make it muchbetter than you would have in your homecountry so we believe that we know thatwe our rights come from God and not thegovernment and that's and thank Godbecause if they came from the governmentthat means they come from mankind womenkind and we both know that men and womenare fallible messed up human beingsand our morality changes with the windand you can't trust it but if you cantrust in a God who has set up his rulesand his statements in you know for allmankind to see that we all should leavelive by them then it is a litmus testthat that we try to live up to asfallible human beings that's thedifference and so I'm urging you to nowthat you've know and you're figuring outand go study look up what you're walkingaway from look up the history of PlannedParenthood go look up the statistics onwhat they actually do look up thestatistics look up where you know FDR'sNew Deal came from find out where howblack people and hispanics andminorities got in the predicament thatwe're in today find out how it happenedlook up the New Deal look up whopromoted redlining these are things thatyou need we need to pay attention tothat you'll find out that that theideology that you've been following isthe exact opposite of what you actuallyfeel for humanity all along you know Ibelieve that you probably have a goodheart that you want things to beequitable and you want things to be justand you want things to be right andyou've been told that the the right-wingor the conservative side has always beenfor white supremacy or for the rich onlyand that is the furthest thing from thetruth I want you to look those things upbegin to go down a rabbit hole and don'tbe afraid of what you find you know theconservatism is not perfect nobody isbecause we're humans but who we serve atthe core at the end of the day isperfect and so you know when you'rewalking away from that I want you towalk to something deeper than justconservatism I'm hoping that you'll lookfurther go to the source go to the coreof why we are free while those who arenot free should be free I want you to goto that source and that source is Godyeah I said it unashamedly God is not aRepublicanGod is not a Democrat God is not anAmerican God is God he is who he is andhe set up his rules and if we go by themthen any country goes by them then theywill prosper just as we have in thiscountry and you'll find out that his sonJesus that came to earth was promotedand talked about you know the the statusof the soul and that this this earthlyrealm is passing away and whether youwalk away from liberalism that's greatbut if you only go as far as walkingtowards conservatism then we haven'tgiven you the full truth becauseconservatism and and being a Republicanor an independent is not gonna save yoursoul we believe that this earth ispassing away and I'm urging you to lookpast look yes walk away from that that'sstep one come over to our side wewelcome you you know learn let us learnfrom you you know we can do a better jobof showing our compassion showing it wecan learn from you how to do that butI'm urging you to go further because ifI don't tell you about who is behindyour freedoms and how you are requiredto serve Him and once what you do serveHim you you are truly freethen I'm not giving you the full truthlike I said no earthly governmental youknow system is going to address youreternity your soul now you may notbelieve that and that might be a bridgetoo far for you right now that's fineyou can come still come on over youdon't have to be a Christianto be a conservative and to enjoy thebenefits of Christianity and God'sworldview you don't have to be aChristian but I will tell you that itstems definitely stems from the ideathat Godsomething outside of humanity createdhumanity with the ability to choose andwith the the knowledge that we arecreated in the image of God and and itis you know Christianity is the onlything that deals with my friend wassaying deals with sin and man the heartof man how deeply depraved the heart ofman is and deals with the ultimate enemynow again that might be too far forbridge to cross for you and I want togive you you know give you give to youin bits and pieces but I urge you tolook further you're walking away fromsomething terrible but I don't want Idon't want you to just walk away and notwalk to something there is a there is abedrock to land on there is somedefinite shore ground that you can plantyour feet on both physically emotionallyideologically socially and spirituallythat you can plant your feet on and knowthat it's not movable okayso I'm gonna talk more more videos aboutit and just at the end of the day forthose of you who are ready it's becomingof someone who has puts their trust inthe one true God and His Son JesusChrist the one who came and sacrificedhimself so that you and I could exercisethe rights that we have and connectourselves back with the one who gave usthose rights in the first place becauseat the end of the day this is only 70 8090 years on this earth if you're luckyand then eternity comes after that youmay not believe in that or you maybelieve in that or you may not know whatyou believe but I urge you to go downthis rabbit hole and go with an openmind and really seek truth what is truewhat sounds the most true what are thewhere do the facts lead you and I'llgive you some scholars and some peoplehave done the great studying and littlegraywork that may help you get you someanswers but since you're walking awaymake sure you walk to the right placedon't get don't get led to the wrongplace since you're welcome to walk awayfrom one evil to another because guesswhat like I said no earthly you know noearthly governmental system is is gonnadeal with your souleverybody's fallible everybody's flawedbut conservatism and capitalism BelieveIt or Not is what best facilitates God'swill governmentally on the face of thisplanet I love you guysshare this video like this video if youthink somebody who is walking away cancan benefit from this go ahead and likeand share like I said you know subscribeI don't know how quickly or how wellYouTube is keeping up with all this butum you keep walking away but come onover to our side come on over to ourside we

in the eyes and Ican look at all the voters in the eyesthat I did the right thing now oncePresident Trump had gotten electedthings changed in the Democratic Partypeople changedthey had become vitriolic they were fullof heat they got very narrow-mindedI saw people have complete meltdowns Iwould go to these Democratic meetingsand I would actually be afraid becauseit was just it was a scary environmentand then if you dare disagree withsomething something as simple as Trumpgoing to a military funeral they wouldjust scream and then say you're racistand in your Nazi and and all this kindof you know America sucks and you knowall the fake patriotism but I'm gonnalet you look around the room Here I am apatriot I did serve in the Navy yesthat's me some of my ribbons and awardsso I didn't take kindly to that I thinkthat the military should have beenrespectful and at that time they weren'tand then it got even further morewhether it was you know if it was awomen's issue then I was mansplainingand I was a sexist you know if it wasany kind of other culture it was mebeing you know a racist a Nazi and thenyou know if I didn't agree with themthen they'd say I was stupid anduneducated so I want you to come herethere's my MBA in business there's mydegree in chemistry and biology and alsohas certifications in project managementin Six Sigma I'm not a stupid man butbecause I didn't agree with them Ibecame that to them and they said oh Ididn't understand I didn't understandthe plight of people these are some ofmy license platesI have lives all over the country wellmostly on the east side I lived in redstates I've lived in blue states and youknow I've known people I've lived inswing statesand I do understand it I've eatenThanksgiving dinner on plantation homesthat still have slave quarters on themthey're not nice obviously but I have akeen awareness of these issues butsomehow I became the enemy because I wasa male I was white that I couldn'tunderstand any of the plights of anyonegrowing up I grew up in West New YorkNew Jersey which is one of the mostdensely populated places on the entireplanet I think it ranked four or fiveactually next to like Guttenberg youmean the city but I grew up in the innercity and I understood it and I grew upas a minority and I grew up in a mostlySouth American community and I enjoyedthatI loved that but somehow they couldn'tfathom that I could understand growingup in in some other area that I justautomatically was had a silver spoon inmy mouth because my skin color I hadsome kind of privilege and he got so badthat I had to break not only from theparty I handed in my resignation fromthe from the board for the moorishcounty committee and with citing thosethings that I felt that I was being madeto be the enemy because I was male and Ihappen to be white that's how I was bornthat's my skin color I can't controlthat but somehow the bigotry and racismwas was blasted upon me and I just Icouldn't handle it anymore I did switchover to the Republican Party onlybecause I wanted to vote for a friend ofmine who was running in the primary forfor the Republicans but I don't considermyself a Republican either you know orRINO Republican in name only what Ireally feel is that the country is readyand needs to have a balanced moderatethird party no more do we have should wehave to worry about who gets to choosethe next Supreme Court justice becausethey're going to give the far right orfar left we need people who are rationalreasonable and canactually make the decision that's rightnot based on party lines we need to havea third party so that not one side cancontrol the House or Senate we need abuffer to make sure that you know a onebad season either way can cause crazythings to happen so I am reallyappreciating Brandon and the walk awaymovement it's taking me a long time todo this I've been following it since thebeginning I think I might have been like10,000 but because of the hatred thatI've been shelled upon I was kind ofafraid you know I I did make it to theBoard of Ed and I did so as anonpartisan candidate and the the amountof heat being a public figure people goon your facebook i had to change myfacebook name I had to I was constantlygetting you know criticized and just itwas he was just abusive and so I haddone what I had promised to do on mycampaign and then wouldn't the year wasover I resigned but I'm not willing tosay quiet anymore because this is tooimportant of movement and what I wouldhope is that we can start meetinglocally for me in North Jersey areamaybe go to a library or something so wecan share our experiences and trying tomaybe even carpool down to theWashington March and just get thingsmoving there maybe even start a thirdparty from

it's been a very very longtime since I actually posted a video soI just want to throw a little somethingup there today you know I mean just telleverybody know what's good you know Imean out here in BK you know everybodyknow they're you know how we move outhere we don't move like everybodyeverybody know how Brooklyn do no matterwe're at in the well you from Brooklynyou know what it be here I just want todo a little something out there aboutthe walkaway movement it is definitely areal movement myself you know I've beenpolitically awakened politically activewhatever you want to call it ever sinceabout 2000 to 2001 - 9/11 was mywalkaway moment I'm pretty sure a lot ofpeople who've been politically activefor a long time that's probably theirwalkaway moment pretty much 2001you know 9/11 being a New Yorkerdefinitely affected me in a veryinteresting way you know before that youknow I was a big-time Democrat you knowI always thought Bill Clinton was thewas like the Omega he was like the rockstar for the black community you know Iwas very young you know I really didn'thave an understanding of how the localscrap spectrum worked you know I was a2d thinker you know over time I'velearned to become a 3d thinker which ithink is a big transformation for a lotof people who walk the political journeyfor so long but again the walk awaymoment the walk wave movement isn't tome really isn't about leaving theDemocratic Party it should be more aboutchanging the way you think you know Iwas again I was a registered Democrat atthe time 9/11 hit kind of changed myperspective on a lot of things becauseof the dance that unfolded and you knowI was able to I mean it was I guess wasact of God the way things happen formyself just a quick synopsis of what myawakening or how myworking in took place at the time when Iwas employed you know for those who knowthe Geographics of New York I wascurrently employed in Long Island andwhen 9/11 hit you know I was kind ofstuck out there because the mass transitsystem was on shutdown so as I wasworking my way back to Brooklyn fromLong Island I did make my way to JamaicaQueens and from that point on I waspretty much on foot because nothing wasrunning so as I'm walking along towardsBrooklyn a gentleman who drove a cabstopped and asked if I needed a ride youknow I shouldn't say accidentally therod actually stopped him saying heylisten you know I need a ride back toBrooklyn how much so as I get in thevehicle and we drive off you know I justhappened to notice that the man was ofMiddle Eastern descent so immediately myreaction was a bit fearful you knowconsidering everything that wasunfolding that day and I remember as hewas driving you know was silent formaybe about about a few miles as wedrove and he just happened to stop at astoplight wanted to stop by stuff westopped that and he he said my friendyou know what do you think of everythinggoing on and obviously my first reactionwas man you know these you know theseMuslims these radicals they're nuts youknow I was you know just following theguideline of what everybody was seeingon TV every day I was unfolding in NewYork and his first reaction to me was myfriend I'm a Muslim don't be afraid butthis is not my belief so you know myreaction was what do you mean that's notyour belief look at what just happenedso he actually pulled over he pulledover as we were driving he pulled overto the side Walker he he said my friendyou seem like a like a nice guy I wantto show you somethingso he pulls out some articles from Iguess whatever the newspaper was at thetime out in Pakistan and he was kind ofShiva showing me a lot of things thatI'd never get broadcast here in the inthe dark or in the United States forthat reason mm at the time the Internetit was big but there was no YouTube youknow there wasn't a bunch of outlets outthere that would get you content ofthings happening around the world asquickly as today so he pulls out his youknow he pulled out this news or thisnewspaper and on the front page there'sa bunch of dead kids like it was armsdisplaced it was blood everywhere andyou know I was took I was taken back forsitting like what do you mean what'swhat's this so he looked at you know hehe presented it to me he said my friendwhoever did this wasn't a Muslim he saidthis is not what we believe in and heshowed me the article he said but I willtell you is somebody's very angry aboutwhat's going on so I looked at the paperand as I you know it wasn't an Englishobviously but I just happened to look atit and he told me he said I'll give youthis rock for free he said but I askedyou to just look at what I'm talkingabout he said there's a lot of thingsgoing on in the world that they don'ttell you here and he said I denouncedanybody who did this heinous act becausetwo wrongs don't make a rightyes this is the kind of stuff that'sgoing on in my country and that's when Isaid what country are you from he saidhim from Pakistanhe said yes this goes on in my countrythere's a lot of kids getting killedbecause of what the United States andIsrael and other countries are doingover there he says so this is this isthis looks like payback for that but Idon't condone it because as much as afirm believer of the Quran and myreligion I denounced this type ofbehavior so that day kind of got mywheels turning and it really oughta myeyes to really what the laws are hereand you know that pretty much is my walkaway story and that happened in 2001 andyou know maturity and you know you kindof you become extreme left you becomeextreme right you know you kind of swingback and forth until you finally realizethat and the end truth is what the realpolitical truth is it has nothing to dowith who's in office it has nothing todoif you like a politician it has to dowith you have to look at the truth ofsomething I have to look at the factsand you come to your truth about it cuzeverybody has their own truth but thefacts of the facts the events thathappen are the events that happen and soforth so as I close this because I don'twant to make this too long I encourageanybody out there who's part of the walkaway movement to really look at youreally need to look at first of all whatare you walking away from what are youwalking away to and always remember tokeep the truth keep your facts accurateand come to your truth don't let anybodytell you what your truth is and I hopethis video reaches the right people Ihope and aspire some to just be freethinkers thank three-dimensional not 2dbecause right now everything you see onTV is 2d they anticipate you not havingyour own critical thinking they expectyou to just follow what they show youfollow what they tell you come on Randyhere 2018any video anything could be manipulatedman the technology is far beyondanything I can imagine as a kid they canmake the video look like anything todaymy advice to everybody is do your ownresearch look at your own informationcome to your own truth this is all sisonand now thanks for tuning in God be good

akid my parents came here from India veryhardworking people very religious veryconservative familyI'd say we're always you know we werealways told by my mom that education isimportant and that our whole goal is tobe educated I recently graduated fromone of the University of Californiacampuses here in California where I liveI was pretty far left I was a liberalI'd say my whole life up until last yearlast year I got the red pill and Iofficially declared myself a Republicanthis year after a lot of researchthought and just overall looking at thepolicies passed by this currentadministration I gotta say you're notthe only reason I was ever a liberal ora Democrat was because I was told I needto be one you know people see my skincolor they see that I'm an immigrant andsay hey you know Democrats are there forthe people there for brown people therefor the minority and I was always toldRepublicans are racist and they don'twant me to have certain rights and allthis sort of nonsense andthey'll come to find out one of trumpsappointments are if I believe oursecretary for the United Nations hasbeen actually an Indian woman nikkihailey so anyways I did some research Ilooked at both of the party platformsand I realized I actually have more incommon with the Republican Party than Ido with the Democratic Party especiallythe current Democratic Party I had anincident happened last year here atMerced which is a very liberal area nowbecause we had that this University hereand it involved I involved a conflictbetween an African American who wasdisobedient to aloft sir and said lawofficer had a broken jaw so long storyshort there was a suspect wanted and thesoup the lounge here in Merced the localpolice went over to get him they had awarrant and everything but for themajority of the kids they'reafrican-american they acted up there wasa conflict and pretty soon this videowent viral about the cops raciallyprofiling these kids and you know I sawthat and that was I guess what redkilled me what exposed me and I just hadI couldn't believe that the excuses theywere making for these kids when theyweren't listening that he stops or theywere being disobedient to the cops thecops were there to do their job and Ithought that was just complete [ __ ]to be honest with you like I've hadplenty of run-in with cops and I'm youknow I don't know if the camera can showbut I'm pretty Brown and nothing hasever happened to me you know if I getpulled over for a ticket I'm polite Iget my ticket and if I have anything tosay about it I'll just show up to courtand then the the school I graduated fromstarted you know they got behind theAfrican American students and startedsaying that they were victims of racismand it was just ridiculous I couldn'tbelieve it and I guess at that point Istarted looking into other things Istarted looking into the one-in-fourstatistic that they do around on campusI was there that one in four women oncampus were raped I started looking intothe wage gap I started looking intoeverything really I even told into thehistory of both political parties andeverything that had to do with civilrights everything that had to do withfreedom had the Republicans were on thefloor front fighting for that stuffwomen's suffrage all that was done bythe Republicans and the Democrats triedto peg racism on the Republicans whichis kind of ironic and sexism too butanyways I just wanted to give anoverview of my story I will probablynever be voting Democrat again as longas I live and I hope more and morepeople are walking away every day is agreat movement Thank You Brandon forstarting it trust me there's plenty ofmore people like us like me out therethat are just so done with the thetactics of the left and thisintimidation and bullying of people thatthink differently and you know we wantAmerica we want the America that wealways loved the freedom of speech wewant everything and we just want to berespected even though we have differentopinions thank you

hey everybodyit's me again I wanted to make anothervideo as a member not a moderator fornow it's been a while since I've kind ofupdated all of you on my walk awayjourney and what's been happening so Ithought I would touch base and justshare a couple of thoughts with you Ican tell you that it seems to be gettingharder which I don't like to say becauseI really thought that walking away wouldlead to liberation and it has to anextent so don't get me wrong but it'salso causing more issues which you knowin hindsight I probably should haveexpected but we are muddling along therehas certainly been some controversyregarding myself being part of thismovement and in terms of my friends andfamily I'm pretty sure my mom is prettyconvinced that I'm a member of a cultand that I'm being duped which is sadbut she's she's not being mean to me orjudgmental necessarily she just wants meto be careful which is understandableshe's a mom but you know I can see thatmy friends are taking notice as wellmany of my liberal friends have postedlinks to articles about us all beingRussian bots and that's been really hardfor me because I'm not a bot you are nota bot a hundred thousand of our friendsare not bots we're sharing our storieswe are explaining what this means to usand why we're walking away and for myown friends to try to discreditsomething that I'm a part of is reallyhurtful and it's been extremelyfrustrating for me because you know Ijoined this page when it was at about2500 mmand I received so much love andacceptance and understanding and advicethat I was really moved and that's whenI decided that I was doing the rightthing and that I was correct inquestioning what I have been told and sofor for me to get involved on a deeperlevel as a moderator and putting as muchtime and effort into making sure thatthis campaign is successful and thateverybody has a safe place to go to whenthey're walking away from the left it'sreally hurtful to see my own friends tryto discredit that and it doesn't seem tomatter how much I explained to them thatthere's an entire group of people thatwould argue with you about being botsit's like they cannot wrap their brainsaround the idea that something could beorganically trending on Twitter it'skind of amazinglike there's no getting through to themand that that's been frustrating andhurtful and so I'm trying to kind offigure out how to navigate through thatI'm not the type of person that justunfriend people I'm not I kind of feellike they have to be the one to do itbecause I'm not going to reject someonebecause they think differently than I doand so while I've certainly been told bymany members in this group to cut thatyou know toxic cancer out of my life Ijust can't do it because I think thatthat is the antithesis of what we'retrying to do here we're trying to showthat civil discourse can exist withouthating one another so so that's kind ofthe conclusion that I've come to but itdoesn't make it any less difficult tosee in my newsfeed I think I'm at thepoint now where I am just going toscroll by and ignore but I can't liewhat I said thatI got very heated when I saw these postsand it was very aggravating but what areyou gonna do I

good afternoon Patriots its July 5thlike a little laziest Martin didn'tshave because I don't have to work um soI figured I'd I've done a couple ofthese videos already but they were abouta year back I figured I'd go ahead anddo another one you know you finddifferent things to talk about on theseanyway I'm gonna start this one bytelling you that I was raised in theDemocratic household that wasn't liberalI know that sounds weird doesn't it butmy dad was a Union factory workermy mother was an elementary schoolteacherthey were both raised on farms so theyhad to farm values both were Christianmy mother was none pretty muchnondenominational my dad was raisedCatholic and my dad went all the way upto the highest local rank in the Knightsof Columbus which is a an organizationattached not really attached to butassociated with Catholic Church and theyare staunchly pro-life being raised onfarms dad was also an avid hunter hestill owns the four guns he had doesn'tget much out doesn't get out muchanymoreb75 his health and moms are both goingdownhill that's why I'm here at theirplace today my sister and I have beentrading off quite a bit to make surethat they can stay in their house notgoing to assisted living basically whatthat being said while my dad tried topush for me to vote Democrat all thetime because of his job I was prettymuch an independentcome from a long line of veterans andI'm one myselfmy mom has two brothers had abrother-in-law God rest his souland a father that were veterans her twobrothers we're one of her brothers andher brother one her brother-in-law wereVietnammy grandfather of course World War twoon my dad's side of the family mygrandfather on that side was also WorldWar two vet and I'm Desert Storm myother uncle served in peacetime duringthe eighties so needless to say thefirst election that I can legally votefor vote in I did vote to try to getGeorge Herbert Walker Bush a second termthat didn't happen but at the time Ididn't realize how much the disease ofliberalism had infected the DemocraticParty and it seems like to get moreinfected every year doesn't it folksand it's nuts my first actualinteraction with liberals happened incollege after the army I went to a localcommunity college went through tradeschool got the associate's degree in atechnical department and one of therequired classes was a political scienceclass I mean I had a cousin that was inthat class with me you know with her andher mom and my mom being sisters and herdad and my dad raised on farms we sharedthe same values we were the only twopeople in that class that were pro-gunand prolife flat flat out up here and alittle ol Alpena Michigan that we werethe only two in that class I was crazyand I really didn't pay much attentionto what was going on in politics fromthere until2008 elections and then I didn't paythis close of attention as I should haveyeah I fell for Obamaevery goddamn lie he told he waspromising to bring jobs back that neverhappened[Music]history healthcare wound up shoving itdown our throats their gunpointbasically you either get the healthcarecare packages we want to give you or paya hefty fine for not being able toafford it so by Obama's second term I'dgotten it I got none to social media andI'm heavily into the antique tractorsthrough my antique tractor groupsI got linked up with a lot of guys inthe Midwest I don't know how many of youwere aware of what he is doing in thiscountry um you've all heard of clive andbud clive in bundy i'm sure both of youknow I'm sure most do you know about itone way or anothersomething didn't strike me right aboutthat because it's not often that farmersand ranchers go up against government Imean I live out here in farm countrythat's a far that's the field in frontof me I could tell you the mostpatriotic people around my dad by thetime I was seven if we were at a paradeand the VFW color guard marched out infront of us if I didn't have my hat inmy hand my dad was not gonna bealongside ahead and I you know you seehim flying from pickup trucks you seehim flying from barns you see him flyingfrom tractors working fields everywhereandyou know here's the Bundys taking uparms against the federal government wellcome to find out the Bureau of LandManagement out westwas designed as a cooperativepartnership there were federal landsthat they were allowing ranchers tograze on the ranchers were paying a feeto graze on them and Bureau of LandManagement would just step in while weneed to improve the land here we need tochange how this is set up under Obamathey decided to shut that operation downbreach the contracts they had with thoseranchers that's what that was abouteverybody was talking about oh he wasn'twilling to pay the grazing fees no hewas perfectly willing to pay the grazingfees they give them an ultimatum shutyour operation down now get your cattleout of here otherwise we're gonna chargeyou so much $500 a day until you get himout of here and then we're gonnaconfiscate them well when they canconfiscate the cattle that's when hetook up arms and then there was aHammonds out there you know they hadstarted controlled burn that got out ofhand in the early 2000s the it wound upcrossing over onto public land they'dalready served jail time paid fines forit well the Bureau of Land Managementunder Obama to say that wasn't enoughretried them for the maximum well manHammond would have been in his 80s whenhe got out had Trump not given thempardons what they were trying to do orwhat they were hoping to do was with theHammond men in jail they're hoping theham and women we couldn't handle theranch ranch and they'd wait up gettingit once it went up for taxes they don'tunderstand ranches out here everybodyworks on ranch if you got a ranch in thefarm every family number works on thatoperation they know that operationEndNote and so by the time elections 20Dean came up I was Adam it I wasn'tvoting Democrat and then when Hillarygot Hillary got the nomination I wasreally adamant I wasn't I wasdisappointed initially that dr. Carsondidn't get it but now I see Trump wasthe right choicewhat kind of irked me was what followedthe election you had up until theelection you know Democrats going oh Ihope the Republicans aren't sore losersholy crap what a show and they lostand what really irks me is before we gotthe rush inclusion crap the first thingwas there was all these races rednecksin the Midwest excuse me you the samepeople voted for Obama eight yearsbefore because they were hoping for achange that never happenedand if you look at the map that happenedtoo late for Trump had already won theelectoral collegewhen Michigan was decided but Michiganturned red for the first time in 20years the reason it was turned red wasdescribed by downstate politician whowas perked at her own partyshe said Trump came down there talkingjobs talking the economy Clinton showedup every time they brought it up shechanged the subject gender pronouns andbathrooms and I made an interestingdiscovery after the election because Idid have one woman that was extremelyliberal on my newsfeed she's now theex-wife of a friend of my friend of minefrom my army service and immediatelyafter the electionnow her Brandon Strock talked about thistoo because he was one of those peopleone of those people it was not one ofthe ones she had on there but she was ofa similar mind frameshe had gay people that were scared todeath that they were going to beimprisoned for their sexual preferencesor or worse she had black people thatwere on her newsfeed that were positiveTrump was going to sign an executiveorder to reverse a constitutionalamendment and put them back into chainsand she had Mexican friends that werecitizens they were swearing up and downthat he was going to port them theliberal media convinced them of thisthey didn't listen to any other newssource and I think they got short-termmemory when it comes to Trump because itwasn't long before it wasn't up until upuntil he got the Republican nominationoh my god liberals loved him you knowyou had pictures in with Jesse Jacksonwith Al Sharpton on The Oprah WinfreyShow it's gotten worse since then trumpderangement syndrome is so far out ofhand right now y'all after watchingthese last two Democratic debates oh mygod those candidates all make Obama looklike Newt Gingrich or that far left holycow Biden wants to give free health careto illegal aliens but completely do awaywith private health care that's justslap in the face to my dad my dad whoworked 43 years in the same plant andhas a very good health health care planthey're going to take that away from orare we yeah take a look at the VA take alook what's going on with the VA andthen take a look at what thedid to our gas cans and then tell me youwant to trust them to handle health careand right now we got Cory Booker downthere helping illegal aliens get intothe country what the hellBernie Sanders promising to up our taxesto cover people of huge college debtlook let me clue you let me this is whatreally messes me up and with a liberalstandpoint you have to grab a hold of abig degree no matter how stupid it isI always thought getting a highereducation was primarily for the purposeof moving forward in a career fieldthat's what my mom did and she's got amaster's in teaching and then there'sguys like my uncle down the road here hegot job as a deckhand on a boat in 18worked his way up to convey Herrmannonce he got the confirming position hethought no I got enough money to takesome college why don't I take collegecourses and become a chief engineer onthe boat and that's just what he did theman is gonna retire at 54 because he wassavvy enough to take his education tomatch his career meanwhile you got thesepeople they're got these giant collegedebts because they took out the maximumthey decided they wanted to live offtheir college loan while taking thesecourses and they took a course and jetthere they took a major in GenderStudies or something like that and nowthey can't get a job they don't and theywant us to pay for it that's whatSanders is about you know it's and evenif you take a career oriented collegecourse and you pass itand you find out you're not real good atthat field see you out in the field andyou find out hey I was really book smartwhen it came to came to masonry but I'mbrilliant worth a damn at it as far asthe career person you can call up theplace it's got that loan and they'llwork with you but it seems like theDemocratic Party is no consequences andbetween that and the privilege pointsystem they got it's stupid andridiculousI mean I'm the scourge of the earthbecause I'm a white man who happened tobe born Christian in out in the countryhow does that work there's people outhere living in a rented trailer housesand the ones in the idiots that arepushed look at who's pushing the slaveappropriations and gay appropriations Ithe slave appropriations I'll at leastgive you cover on Cory Booker whoseparents were both IBM executives andsent him to an Ivy League school inEngland that's better than 90% of mostof the people in this country if this isthe best they got the Democratic Party'sdone the only way they're gonna win isif we get stupid like they did in 2016go oh our candidates got it in the baglet's just not go out and voteliberalism is a disease a disease itjust needs to go away and we've gotpeople right now in this country thatare praising communism and socialismI was one of the last ones in Germanywhen Wall fell the difference betweenEast Germany and West Germany wasn'tprettysocialism is screwed up it took theseGerman it took East Germany five yearsfrom the time Germany reunited to getback on a level playing field with therest of the rest of Germany and while wewere being called Nazis and Tifa isn'tgetting punished as a hate group theyclaim to be anti-fascist but they'reacting just like the brown shirts circa1935 now we need to give Trump a secondterm we need to take the house back weneed to have a stronger force in theSenate because right now conservativismis the only way to go I don't I'm not abig fan of McCain's but I really wishI'd have paid closer attention in 282008 because I don't know how many howmany of you remember Joe Lieberman itwas John Kerry's running mate in 2004shortly afterwards he had some sort offalling-out with the Democratic Partythey dropped him as a candidate for hisown seat estate he went independent andwon it anyway and then transferred tolibertarian he wasn't campaigning forObama he was campaigning for McCainwhat's that tell you there aren't anymore like my parents left that areDemocrats but not liberals the psychoticones have taken over the asylum there'sno way I could possibly vote for themever again[Music]
Sullivan and I want to tell you my storyabout why I walked away it's been awhile since I walked away but mygrandfather was a union leader so myfamily has been Democrat going backseveral generations and I actuallyworked on the Clinton campaign when webuilt it around but as time went on andI started seeing what was going on withthe Clintonsfirst of all and then when I starteddoing some research

thePodesta's the Clintons and others thatwas the last straw that made me say okaythat's it no more voting for a Democrateven if I think that some of theircandidates may be better than some ofthe Republican candidates and then I sawDonald Trump who I truly believeactually loves the United States Ihonestly don't believe that the manmeant to win at first I think he did itmore in antagonist eclis to try to getthe people to step up their game a bitbut I think once he toured the UnitedStates and saw the huge decline in ourcities and our youth addicted to opiatesand the really horrific a youth gangsall different youth gangs that a lot ofthem their members are illegal aliensI believe that when he saw what badshape the United States is in I reallytruly do believe that he is a patriotand he has the best in mind for themthen when I saw the attacks that most ofthem are founded on false premises thatthe media is putting forward as fact Iwas horrified and when I tried to startto educate

yeahyou
hey guysthis is gonna be my walkaway video Iknow I made a post about my walk awaybut I want to do a video because I feellike videos and speaking at out Oakleyseems more authentic to me usuallytalking out seems authentic rather thanjust you know words on the screen so youknow my journey has sort of been it'sdoing over Tom it's been something thatI've had to you know discover as I go soI'm from Tennessee I moved to Californiamoved to Los Angeles about two years agothe reason for moving to Los Angeles isI'm wanting to pursue modeling you knowwanted to you know sort ofyou know live my life and figure outwhat direction I want to go in the pastso I was in Tennessee I also went to artschool I actually went to a communitycollege first drop down and then I wentto an art school in a drop-down and so Idon't have a degree or anything I movedout here to pursue modeling and just toget my life started but as far aspolitics goes I was very I gotinterested into politics you know aroundwhen I was in probably about middleschool going into hospital is when Istarted to become more aware of it andyou know I started to do my researchgradually into you know what I see fitsme what kind of values visit me and atthe same time I was going through issueswith my sexuality I'd been going throughit for years at that same time and soyou know as I was discovering you knowbecause originally you know I came outas being gay and then this past yearthis year I came out as being bisexualbut throughout those times when I was inyou know living with my parents inTennessee I'd struggled with mysexuality and so you know I rememberseeing a lot of things about you knowgay marriage and things getting passedand things in that nature and you knowthe Democratic Party seemed to be theone that was making those moves and soyou know as you know it said about manypeople inyou know who are gay or you knowbisexual or whatever they always usuallygravitate towards you know DemocraticParty because we assume that they arethe party that's gonna help us orthey're the party that's gonna you knowin advance things and as you know as youknow like the election the election wasyou know the 2016 election that was inawaking for me like you know I go backto like you know some of the Brandonstock some of his storyIlan's with bond in some ways becauseduring the election it was devastatingto me toobecause as we were leading up to the2016 election there was a fear ofRothstein taken away everything wasbeing whirled back this and that and soyou know it hit me of course I wascrying that night upset me and I wasnervous and scared as to what the futurewould hold and because it's scared me alot because I do I genuinely love mycountry I do I love I've always beenpatriotic comes feijoada growing upthat's something that's been instilledinto me from my family you know we valueour country and that's one thing that Ivalue a lot you know coming from a moreconservative background and then cominginto a liberal place you know it's I'mI've become you know I value thosethings more when I don't see you knowrespect from people in this liberalenvironment you know I respect thevalues that my parents gave me theconservative values and it starts tobecome more aware of how I feelbecause I've always you know I I'vealways been somebody that likes to helpout people you know I always beensomebody who's very I feel like I'm verycaring towards other peopleand so I want to get back to what I wassaying but the election it upset me in alot of ways because because of what wewere told as far as the media isconcerned we were told that everythingwas gonna roll back there was this fearand as these past three years have goneon since Donald Trump has been presidentI've noticed you know I've sort ofbecome a little bit more aware of whatis going on and what we are being toldand I've noticed that a lot of it youknow is from the fear the media and thenews surrounding everything is trying tobring fear they want us to be fearful ofwhat is going on and so that is whythere's so many problems because peoplefeed into that fear they're afraid toask questions and you know I started toI started to become I know it soundsfunny but story to become self-awarewhat is going on because a lot of timesyou know I feel like what I've startedto notice it more you know I notice itmore and more as I you know kind of winend and did research unnoticed you knowit's like you have a brand new set ofpair of eyes and you see thingsdifferently once you research and onceyou find out what's going on and soafter I realized that the media is thesetrue would Don Trump said that the mediais fake its fake newsin it you know at the time when you hearit it's like yeah well he's trying tosay the media is not a good thing butthat's not what he's saying and so youknow I became aware that he is righthe's telling the truththe truth is there but a lot of peopleand this is one thing that hurt meis I like to ask questions that is onething about me is I do like to askquestions and I like to know what isgoing on and you know once you askquestions it seems like you can getattacked you know for having a differentopinion and a different view but onething that really solidified everythingthat really locked me into place waswhen I made a post about supportingDonald Trump it was not a post forattention it was just to show my supportbecause I didn't I was doing my researchand I found out you know a lot of thethings I was being told were not correctthey were not correct at all and once Ipushed that out into the world chaosensued and I found out a lot of darknessthat comes from people and a lot of thehate I would say that comes from peopleand you know after all this you know Iregistered as a Republican as you know Iwould never have thought that I wentchanged to the Republican Party likemany have said but as I started toresearch and as I've started to foundout all of these thingsI realized that the Republican Partyaligns with my values and my beliefs asto how we should care for our countryhow we should care for our veterans youknow how we should care for our people Ibecame to realize that that is what I'maligned with you know that is myalignment and regardless of my sexualityor you know who I am that does notdefine that you know my values are myvalues and nobody can tell me how I'msupposed to believe if I can tell me whoI'm supposed to be and just because I ambisexual or gay or whatever that I haveto align with this one party I don't Idon't I have my own beliefs and valueswhat I think is best and you know it isreally reassured me and is made me feelbetter as a person to be able to say youknow it's almost like coming out againbut it shouldn't be that way we shouldbe able to just speak how we feelwithout having fear and so you knowthat's sort of you know that's just itshouldn't be like this we shouldn't haveto do this but it is important that weshare in these views so that the worldknows and that the country knows youknow and I'm happy that there's thiswalkaway campaign this walkaway movementbecause it is helped me in this journeyand once I found it out it became this Istarted watching all of the videos andit became this peaceful look at you knowother people's experiences and Germany'sand so it encouraged me to speak how Ifeel so I think you guys all from youshare your videos because it's it reallyhas helped mein myself discovery you know I'm 24 Iknow and you know I'm still growing inlove and so I'm just so happy that thisI've found this place you know and justthis movement I guess I should say andyou know that I'm able to say you knowthat I'm bisexual and I'm you know aRepublican conservative whatever so Ijust thank you guys for listening tothis for watching this and I'm hopingthat you know I can be a voice in thismovement as well and to help you know tobe able to volunteer to do somethingmore rather than just you know havingyou know topping some on a screen orseeing something on the screen I'drather be able to do it more in personand I hope that I'll be able to you knowreally take action out in our countrybut anyways thank you for watching thisand this was my walk away story[Music]
I walked away from the Democratic Partyback in probably 2007 and keep walkingand these are some of the reasons why Iwalked now one of the reasons why I wasa Democrat to begin with was a I'm blackif you're black and working inmiddle-class family that's just whatyou're assumed to be and that's whereyou pretty much usually go when you doregister to vote reasons why I'm walkingaway I'm walking away from intoleranceI'm walking away from the lack ofdiverse thoughts I'm walking away fromgroupthink what that means is that thisfar-left movement that is taken over theDemocratic will party seem to think thatif you are not in line with every singlepolicy and the group that you are evilthat you should be attacked and forinstance in 2016 presidential electionall of the polls are wrong all of themwhy because now the this far leftmovement within the Democratic Party hascreated an environment where peoplecannot articulate what they think theycannot say what they think they cannotdo or say anything that seems to becontrary to any liberal policy orplatform agenda anything without beinghurled insults called evil racist bigotsbasket of deplorable for the samereasons why many of us join theDemocratic Party because we thought theDemocrats were very tolerant we thoughtthat they were open to different groupsof people you know and we criticized theRepublicans for not you know for notbeing that for instance we rightfullycriticized those who made it impossiblefor those who were gay to come out tothe people that they loved to come outto the world and public MIT hey I'mqueer and I'm here they had to live inthe closet for fear retribution well nowyou've got the liberal left havemillions of people around the worldliving in a closet that they didn't feelas though they can they couldn't evencome out they had to do it in the votingbooth and to surprise the world like ohmy god we lost Michigan oh my god welost Ohio oh my god we lost themSylvania you know Pennsylvania and Ohiohas not gone for a Republican since 1988how did this happenyou know really really shocked at thatwhy because you know the people in thosestates when previously polled could notadmit or come out that this is how theyfelt that this is how they may vote notbecause they particularly like theindividual as an ending or theircharacter but just because of maybetheir economic situation what thisperson was saying and or offering wasdifferent than what they had seen youknow because it was changed that wasn'tbeing offered by the other party interms of better economic living a bettereconomic environment and they wereafraid to come out and even those whomay agree with certain policies areafraid to articulate it because they maynot be liberal on everything they may beconservative on one or two issues butare afraid to come out as such and asyou look at this walkaway movement youwill see a lot of gay lesbiantransgender individuals who are a partof this movement because some of themare conservative on certain issues andthey will say and even Bruce Jenner orCaitlyn Jenner has come out and saidthat it is harder for them to come outas conservatives than it was for them tocome out as gay or as transgenderbecause that's the environment that theliberal left has created that I amwalking away from that kind ofoppression of thought oppression adiversity of thought I mean it's notjust about diversity of religion andskin tone but also about thought that Iam walking towards the freedom andinclusiveness of that I am walking awayfrom control walking away from the quoteunquote plantation that is theDemocratic plantation and a Republicantransplantation they like to tell youthat you're free but we are not in afree countrywe're in a country that is freer thanmost but we live in a country where youhave millions of people like let's usethis election for instance yet 65million people give or take a few thatwanted control and power over the other63 62 million that voted for you knowTrump you have the 65 million Hillarysupports that wanted to control thepolicy agenda and rules over the otherhalf of the country we are not free atsome times to marry who we want to usewhatever drugs into substance that wewant to put whatever we want in our bodyeven if we do it in the privacy of ourown home without hurting others we arenot free to collect drinking we're notfree to collect rain rain water we'renot free to drink raw milk or distributeit we're not free to sell lemonade on acorner without a permit we're not freeto build our own home on our own paidproperty how we see fit without thegovernment telling us how we have tobuild it what code of standard it has tolive up towe are not we're living in a countrywhere it's getting less and less free toown whatever firearm you want even ifyou are trained trained to use thatfirearm no mental capabilities we have amovement and orlaf that's now trying tocontrol what you can and cannot get andhas the nerve or audacity to say wellwhat do you need was such-and-such aweapon it's really none of your businessand we have a second Amendment as alsostated in the Bill of Rights andDeclaration of Independence where it wasassumed that at some point thegovernment could become tyrannical andthe people need to have the power andability to overthrow and do away withsaid government not just vote out theindividuals in power but you may need tohave an armed revolution to take backcontrol because freedom has never beenhistorically given to the people it'salways had to be take always had to beentaken by force more often than notand you shouldn't be afraid to have tochallenge your government and governmentpeople should not be afraid of theirgovernment their government should beafraid of their people that's how itreally should be I'm walking away fromthat level of control because you have acouple different kinds of control youhave the kind of control where you're inthe cell and you can see the bars andthen there's another form ofdictatorship or control perhaps thegreatest form where you can't see thebars and you think you're free that'swhat America is the latter part whereyou don't see the bars that you're inand you think you're free when reallyyou're being fundamentally controlledand manipulated by X amount of rules Imean who else knew that you legallyreally can't sell lemonade on a corneryou know there was a little girl and Ibelieve Wisconsin a few years ago whoonly 11 years old but wanted a car youwanted to be able to save up for a carwhen she turned 16 so what does she doshe found way a way to make moneyherself not just doing chores but shetook baking lessons and then started tosell cupcakes and actual cakes tofriends and family and was really reallygood at it making a lot of money enoughfor her parents to even build anattachment to their own kitchen to havean additional oven for their daughter touse to bake her cakes and store them andshe was doing really good in a secondthe government found out about it theyshut that little side business that thegirl was doing down you're not I meanthat's crazy I'm walking away from thecontrol that is the government thatplantation that they want us all on theysay what we can or cannot do I amwalking away from the lies of theliberal left yes all politicians liethat's just a fact and I'm walking awayfrom accepting those lies just becauseit's coming from the political party ortrying to I belong to I am walking awayfrom the hypocrisy that is the left I'mwalking away from the Selective outragewhere they only seem to be outraged overthings that the Republicans do and yetturn a blind eye whentheir own party does the same exact crap[Music]for instance let's say for example thiswhole Russia investigation there's beenreally no link of collusion between theDemocrat on between the Trumpadministration and Russia there havebeen arrests made due to people lyingabout things they said but not arrestedor indictments because of actualconnection let's get that straight butas far as the hypocrisy and selectiveoutrage if the Russians were involved inhelping Julian Assange hack the DNCservers in which WikiLeaks then todisperse that information they revealnothing that was false nothing that wasfabricated and he needed to be retractedthey released information of HillaryClinton saying to her private donorsconfirming one of my own beliefs andvindicating the fact that I know thatpoliticians are liars where Hillary saidit's okay to have a private opinion toyou my donors and then have a separateopinion to the public in other wordssaying it's okay the lie to the peoplebecause they don't know any better theydon't need to know the truth so long asI push your agenda private bankers andunions I push your agenda first andthat's gonna be what I'm gonna do when Iget into office and then I'll tell thepeople something else the Russia did notforce Hillary to say that or to admitthat Russia did not force Donna Brazileto leak to the Hillary Clinton campaigndebate questions in advance the Russiansdid not force debbie Wasserman shortsshe or Shultz to rig the electionespecially the DNC primary election tosteal it from Bernie Sanders by andfavouring have Hillary Clinton campaignby putting the Democratic debates onweekend nights weekend nights when theyknow people aren't gonna be home towatch it on night at the same exact timeas Sunday Night Football or on Saturdaynight at the same time as then-c-double-a roll bowl games when againthey know people are going to bewatching those gamesas opposed to the actual debates tolimit Bernie Sanders appeal and exposureto the masses and as well to limitHillary Clinton's weaknesses to thepeople and are her unlike ability in herfavor they the DNC rigged the electionthe DNC tried to manipulate the electionin Hillary Clinton's favor the Russiansdidn't make them do that all they didwas reveal the corruption that washappening and yet all we want to focuson is Russia Russia Russia that's likegetting mad at Maury for revealing thatyour girlfriend is now pregnant withanother man's kid and getting mad atMaury rather than your woman thatcheated on you you are being selectivelyoutraged at things that one side of thepolitical aisle is doing while turning awillful blind eye and or giving me yourparty a pass I am walking away frombeing offended about everything I amwalking away from the snowflakementality that exists on the right - butespecially on the lap I mean it's theleft that's trading things like termslike microaggression estate left that issaying that you cannot use certain wordsor pronouns like his or heard becauseyou may be offending someone it's theleft that is creating things liketrigger words and/or microaggressionsyou know just because someone may beoffering a difference of an opinion inyours I am walking away from theinability to have a conversation withsomeone who I'm a politically orideologically disagree with I'm walkingaway from the concept that we cannothave a nice healthy debate and thenbeing able to walk away at the end ofthe day and say hey you want to go getsomething to drink or you know hey wemay not see eye-to-eye on this and wecan at the end of the day agree todisagreebut you know I still love you my brotherI still love you my you know Republicanbrother I still love you my you knowsister I am walking away from all ofthat and walking towards being able tohave different views without having tocomeanother I'm walking away from thatintolerance I am walking away from theidentity politics the victimhoodmentality I am walking away from theidea that just because I'm a minority Ihave to be of a little certain politicalpersuasion like oh he's black so hecan't be Republican I'm which I'm notbut the idea that I can't hold certainconservative views I'm walking away fromthe idea that my party can do no wrongI'm walking away from the idea that Ihave to follow my party regardless ofwhat they say and one of the things Inoticed also recently is it doesn'treally matter what someone in your ownparty says so long as it comes from aDemocrat you're okay with it but if itcomes from a Republican even if aDemocrat also agreed with it you'llagree with the Democrat for saying itbut hate the Republican for instanceback in 2008 selection Howard Stern wentto Harlem to talk to some black votersand ask them their opinion of the 2008presidential election they took Obama'spolicy and agendas from his website andto some quotes he said but attributedthose quotes and policies to John McCainand when presented them to the votersthat they were coming across on thestreet the voters were Bement Leeagainst it and then Howard Stern's guytook policy point talking point fromJohn McCain and attributed them toPresident

fromthe Trump website and campaignattributed them to Hillary Clinton andwhen ax didn't Democrat about it theysaid I can agree with that I like thatand then they flipped it and tooktalking points on Hillary Clinton andattributed them to Dawson Donald Trumplike no no I'm not for that don'tbelieve me you can look it up it didhappen there is a mentality again thatyou are willing to accept anything thatcomes from a Democrat but when anythingis said by a Republican regardless ofwhat it is they can find a cure forcancer oh he is so evil that I am soagainst that cure it's gotten to thatpoint even with this whole North Koreathing it seems like the left wouldrather us go to war with North Korea andKim jong-un than to make some some forma peace with them you know anythingthat's good oh it's bad

try and get through weekto week you know that's a big deal butagain they crap on any form of positivenews or anything that's attributed tothe other side and I'm walking away fromthat mentality where just because it'sfrom my party I don't care what they sayor do I'm automatically gonna supportthem no I'm gonna be consistentconsistent with my outrage consistentwith calling people out online I'm justwalking towards being an individual andfree thinker that's my walk away storyhopefully everyone has a great timegreat day peace and love[Music]I walked away from the Democratic Partyback in probably 2007 and keep walkingand these are some of the reasons why Iwalked now one of the reasons why I wasa Democrat to begin with was a I'm blackif you're black and working inmiddle-class family that's just whatyou're assumed to be and that's whereyou pretty much usually go when you doregister to vote reasons why I'm walkingaway I'm walking away from intoleranceI'm walking away from the lack ofdiverse thoughts I'm walking away fromgroupthink what that means is that thisfar-left movement that is taken over theDemocratic will party seem to think thatif you are not in line with every singlepolicy and the group that you are evilthat you should be attacked and forinstance in 2016 presidential electionall of the polls are wrong all of themwhy because now the this far leftmovement within the Democratic Party hascreated an environment where peoplecannot articulate what they think theycannot say what they think they cannotdo or say anything that seems to becontrary to any liberal policy orplatform agenda anything without beinghurled insults called evil racist bigotsbasket of deplorable for the samereasons why many of us join theDemocratic Party because we thought theDemocrats were very tolerant we thoughtthat they were open to different groupsof people you know and we criticized theRepublicans for not you know for notbeing that for instance we rightfullycriticized those who made it impossiblefor those who were gay to come out tothe people that they loved to come outto the world and public MIT hey I'mqueer and I'm here they had to live inthe closet for fear retribution well nowyou've got the liberal left havemillions of people around the worldliving in a closet that they didn't feelas though they can they couldn't evencome out they had to do it in the votingbooth and to surprise the world like ohmy god we lost Michigan oh my god welost Ohio oh my god we lost themSylvania you know Pennsylvania and Ohiohas not gone for a Republican since 1988how did this happenyou know really really shocked at thatwhy because you know the people in thosestates when previously polled could notadmit or come out that this is how theyfelt that this is how they may vote notbecause they particularly like theindividual as an ending or theircharacter but just because of maybetheir economic situation what thisperson was saying and or offering wasdifferent than what they had seen youknow because it was changed that wasn'tbeing offered by the other party interms of better economic living a bettereconomic environment and they wereafraid to come out and even those whomay agree with certain policies areafraid to articulate it because they maynot be liberal on everything they may beconservative on one or two issues butare afraid to come out as such and asyou look at this walkaway movement youwill see a lot of gay lesbiantransgender individuals who are a partof this movement because some of themare conservative on certain issues andthey will say and even Bruce Jenner orCaitlyn Jenner has come out and saidthat it is harder for them to come outas conservatives than it was for them tocome out as gay or as transgenderbecause that's the environment that theliberal left has created that I amwalking away from that kind ofoppression of thought oppression adiversity of thought I mean it's notjust about diversity of religion andskin tone but also about thought that Iam walking towards the freedom andinclusiveness of that I am walking awayfrom control walking away from the quoteunquote plantation that is theDemocratic plantation and a Republicantransplantation they like to tell youthat you're free but we are not in afree countrywe're in a country that is freer thanmost but we live in a country where youhave millions of people like let's usethis election for instance yet 65million people give or take a few thatwanted control and power over the other63 62 million that voted for you knowTrump you have the 65 million Hillarysupports that wanted to control thepolicy agenda and rules over the otherhalf of the country we are not free atsome times to marry who we want to usewhatever drugs into substance that wewant to put whatever we want in our bodyeven if we do it in the privacy of ourown home without hurting others we arenot free to collect drinking we're notfree to collect rain rain water we'renot free to drink raw milk or distributeit we're not free to sell lemonade on acorner without a permit we're not freeto build our own home on our own paidproperty how we see fit without thegovernment telling us how we have tobuild it what code of standard it has tolive up towe are not we're living in a countrywhere it's getting less and less free toown whatever firearm you want even ifyou are trained trained to use thatfirearm no mental capabilities we have amovement and orlaf that's now trying tocontrol what you can and cannot get andhas the nerve or audacity to say wellwhat do you need was such-and-such aweapon it's really none of your businessand we have a second Amendment as alsostated in the Bill of Rights andDeclaration of Independence where it wasassumed that at some point thegovernment could become tyrannical andthe people need to have the power andability to overthrow and do away withsaid government not just vote out theindividuals in power but you may need tohave an armed revolution to take backcontrol because freedom has never beenhistorically given to the people it'salways had to be take always had to beentaken by force more often than notand you shouldn't be afraid to have tochallenge your government and governmentpeople should not be afraid of theirgovernment their government should beafraid of their people that's how itreally should be I'm walking away fromthat level of control because you have acouple different kinds of control youhave the kind of control where you're inthe cell and you can see the bars andthen there's another form ofdictatorship or control perhaps thegreatest form where you can't see thebars and you think you're free that'swhat America is the latter part whereyou don't see the bars that you're inand you think you're free when reallyyou're being fundamentally controlledand manipulated by X amount of rules Imean who else knew that you legallyreally can't sell lemonade on a corneryou know there was a little girl and Ibelieve Wisconsin a few years ago whoonly 11 years old but wanted a car youwanted to be able to save up for a carwhen she turned 16 so what does she doshe found way a way to make moneyherself not just doing chores but shetook baking lessons and then started tosell cupcakes and actual cakes tofriends and family and was really reallygood at it making a lot of money enoughfor her parents to even build anattachment to their own kitchen to havean additional oven for their daughter touse to bake her cakes and store them andshe was doing really good in a secondthe government found out about it theyshut that little side business that thegirl was doing down you're not I meanthat's crazy I'm walking away from thecontrol that is the government thatplantation that they want us all on theysay what we can or cannot do I amwalking away from the lies of theliberal left yes all politicians liethat's just a fact and I'm walking awayfrom accepting those lies just becauseit's coming from the political party ortrying to I belong to I am walking awayfrom the hypocrisy that is the left I'mwalking away from the Selective outragewhere they only seem to be outraged overthings that the Republicans do and yetturn a blind eye whentheir own party does the same exact crap[Music]for instance let's say for example thiswhole Russia investigation there's beenreally no link of collusion between theDemocrat on between the Trumpadministration and Russia there havebeen arrests made due to people lyingabout things they said but not arrestedor indictments because of actualconnection let's get that straight butas far as the hypocrisy and selectiveoutrage if the Russians were involved inhelping Julian Assange hack the DNCservers in which WikiLeaks then todisperse that information they revealnothing that was false nothing that wasfabricated and he needed to be retractedthey released information of HillaryClinton saying to her private donorsconfirming one of my own beliefs andvindicating the fact that I know thatpoliticians are liars where Hillary saidit's okay to have a private opinion toyou my donors and then have a separateopinion to the public in other wordssaying it's okay the lie to the peoplebecause they don't know any better theydon't need to know the truth so long asI push your agenda private bankers andunions I push your agenda first andthat's gonna be what I'm gonna do when Iget into office and then I'll tell thepeople something else the Russia did notforce Hillary to say that or to admitthat Russia did not force Donna Brazileto leak to the Hillary Clinton campaigndebate questions in advance the Russiansdid not force debbie Wasserman shortsshe or Shultz to rig the electionespecially the DNC primary election tosteal it from Bernie Sanders by andfavouring have Hillary Clinton campaignby putting the Democratic debates onweekend nights weekend nights when theyknow people aren't gonna be home towatch it on night at the same exact timeas Sunday Night Football or on Saturdaynight at the same time as then-c-double-a roll bowl games when againthey know people are going to bewatching those gamesas opposed to the actual debates tolimit Bernie Sanders appeal and exposureto the masses and as well to limitHillary Clinton's weaknesses to thepeople and are her unlike ability in herfavor they the DNC rigged the electionthe DNC tried to manipulate the electionin Hillary Clinton's favor the Russiansdidn't make them do that all they didwas reveal the corruption that washappening and yet all we want to focuson is Russia Russia Russia that's likegetting mad at Maury for revealing thatyour girlfriend is now pregnant withanother man's kid and getting mad atMaury rather than your woman thatcheated on you you are being selectivelyoutraged at things that one side of thepolitical aisle is doing while turning awillful blind eye and or giving me yourparty a pass I am walking away frombeing offended about everything I amwalking away from the snowflakementality that exists on the right - butespecially on the lap I mean it's theleft that's trading things like termslike microaggression estate left that issaying that you cannot use certain wordsor pronouns like his or heard becauseyou may be offending someone it's theleft that is creating things liketrigger words and/or microaggressionsyou know just because someone may beoffering a difference of an opinion inyours I am walking away from theinability to have a conversation withsomeone who I'm a politically orideologically disagree with I'm walkingaway from the concept that we cannothave a nice healthy debate and thenbeing able to walk away at the end ofthe day and say hey you want to go getsomething to drink or you know hey wemay not see eye-to-eye on this and wecan at the end of the day agree todisagreebut you know I still love you my brotherI still love you my you know Republicanbrother I still love you my you knowsister I am walking away from all ofthat and walking towards being able tohave different views without having tocomeanother I'm walking away from thatintolerance I am walking away from theidentity politics the victimhoodmentality I am walking away from theidea that just because I'm a minority Ihave to be of a little certain politicalpersuasion like oh he's black so hecan't be Republican I'm which I'm notbut the idea that I can't hold certainconservative views I'm walking away fromthe idea that my party can do no wrongI'm walking away from the idea that Ihave to follow my party regardless ofwhat they say and one of the things Inoticed also recently is it doesn'treally matter what someone in your ownparty says so long as it comes from aDemocrat you're okay with it but if itcomes from a Republican even if aDemocrat also agreed with it you'llagree with the Democrat for saying itbut hate the Republican for instanceback in 2008 selection Howard Stern wentto Harlem to talk to some black votersand ask them their opinion of the 2008presidential election they took Obama'spolicy and agendas from his website andto some quotes he said but attributedthose quotes and policies to John McCainand when presented them to the

let's usethis election for instance yet 65million people give or take a few thatwanted control and power over the other63 62 million that voted for you knowTrump you have the 65 million Hillarysupports that wanted to control thepolicy agenda and rules over the otherhalf of the country we are not free atsome times to marry who we want to usewhatever drugs into substance that wewant to put whatever we want in our bodyeven if we do it in the privacy of ourown home without hurting others we arenot free to collect drinking we're notfree to collect rain rain water we'renot free to drink raw milk or distributeit we're not free to sell lemonade on acorner without a permit we're not freeto build our own home on our own paidproperty how we see fit without thegovernment telling us how we have tobuild it what code of standard it has tolive up towe are not we're living in a countrywhere it's getting less and less free toown whatever firearm you want even ifyou are trained trained to use thatfirearm no mental capabilities we have amovement and orlaf that's now trying tocontrol what you can and cannot get andhas the nerve or audacity to say wellwhat do you need was such-and-such aweapon it's really none of your businessand we have a second Amendment as alsostated in the Bill of Rights andDeclaration of Independence where it wasassumed that at some point thegovernment could become tyrannical andthe people need to have the power andability to overthrow and do away withsaid government not just vote out theindividuals in power but you may need tohave an armed revolution to take backcontrol because freedom has never beenhistorically given to the people it'salways had to be take always had to beentaken by force more often than notand you shouldn't be afraid to have tochallenge your government and governmentpeople should not be afraid of theirgovernment their government should beafraid of their people that's how itreally should be I'm walking away fromthat level of control because you have acouple different kinds of control youhave the kind of control where you're inthe cell and you can see the bars andthen there's another form ofdictatorship or control perhaps thegreatest form where you can't see thebars and you think you're free that'swhat America is the latter part whereyou don't see the bars that you're inand you think you're free when reallyyou're being fundamentally controlledand manipulated by X amount of rules Imean who else knew that you legallyreally can't sell lemonade on a corneryou know there was a little girl and Ibelieve Wisconsin a few years ago whoonly 11 years old but wanted a car youwanted to be able to save up for a carwhen she turned 16 so what does she doshe found way a way to make moneyherself not just doing chores but shetook baking lessons and then started tosell cupcakes and actual cakes tofriends and family and was really reallygood at it making a lot of money enoughfor her parents to even build anattachment to their own kitchen to havean additional oven for their daughter touse to bake her cakes and store them andshe was doing really good in a secondthe government found out about it theyshut that little side business that thegirl was doing down you're not I meanthat's crazy I'm walking away from thecontrol that is the government thatplantation that they want us all on theysay what we can or cannot do I amwalking away from the lies of theliberal left yes all politicians liethat's just a fact and I'm walking awayfrom accepting those lies just becauseit's coming from the political party ortrying to I belong to I am walking awayfrom the hypocrisy that is the left I'mwalking away from the Selective outragewhere they only seem to be outraged overthings that the Republicans do and yetturn a blind eye whentheir own party does the same exact crap[Music]for instance let's say for example thiswhole Russia investigation there's beenreally no link of collusion between theDemocrat on between the Trumpadministration and Russia there havebeen arrests made due to people lyingabout things they said but not arrestedor indictments because of actualconnection let's get that straight butas far as the hypocrisy and selectiveoutrage if the Russians were involved inhelping Julian Assange hack the DNCservers in which WikiLeaks then todisperse that information they revealnothing that was false nothing that wasfabricated and he needed to be retractedthey released information of HillaryClinton saying to her private donorsconfirming one of my own beliefs andvindicating the fact that I know thatpoliticians are liars where Hillary saidit's okay to have a private opinion toyou my donors and then have a separateopinion to the public in other wordssaying it's okay the lie to the peoplebecause they don't know any better theydon't need to know the truth so long asI push your agenda private bankers andunions I push your agenda first andthat's gonna be what I'm gonna do when Iget into office and then I'll tell thepeople something else the Russia did notforce Hillary to say that or to admitthat Russia did not force Donna Brazileto leak to the Hillary Clinton campaigndebate questions in advance the Russiansdid not force debbie Wasserman shortsshe or Shultz to rig the electionespecially the DNC primary election tosteal it from Bernie Sanders by andfavouring have Hillary Clinton campaignby putting the Democratic debates onweekend nights weekend nights when theyknow people aren't gonna be home towatch it on night at the same exact timeas Sunday Night Football or on Saturdaynight at the same time as then-c-double-a roll bowl games when againthey know people are going to bewatching those gamesas opposed to the actual debates tolimit Bernie Sanders appeal and exposureto the masses and as well to limitHillary Clinton's weaknesses to thepeople and are her unlike ability in herfavor they the DNC rigged the electionthe DNC tried to manipulate the electionin Hillary Clinton's favor the Russiansdidn't make them do that all they didwas reveal the corruption that washappening and yet all we want to focuson is Russia Russia Russia that's likegetting mad at Maury for revealing thatyour girlfriend is now pregnant withanother man's kid and getting mad atMaury rather than your woman thatcheated on you you are being selectivelyoutraged at things that one side of thepolitical aisle is doing while turning awillful blind eye and or giving me yourparty a pass I am walking away frombeing offended about everything I amwalking away from the snowflakementality that exists on the right - butespecially on the lap I mean it's theleft that's trading things like termslike microaggression estate left that issaying that you cannot use certain wordsor pronouns like his or heard becauseyou may be offending someone it's theleft that is creating things liketrigger words and/or microaggressionsyou know just because someone may beoffering a difference of an opinion inyours I am walking away from theinability to have a conversation withsomeone who I'm a politically orideologically disagree with I'm walkingaway from the concept that we cannothave a nice healthy debate and thenbeing able to walk away at the end ofthe day and say hey you want to go getsomething to drink or you know hey wemay not see eye-to-eye on this and wecan at the end of the day agree todisagreebut you know I still love you my brotherI still love you my you know Republicanbrother I still love you my you knowsister I am walking away from all ofthat and walking towards being able tohave different views without having tocomeanother I'm walking away from thatintolerance I am walking away from theidentity politics the victimhoodmentality I am walking away from theidea that just because I'm a minority Ihave to be of a little certain politicalpersuasion like oh he's black so hecan't be Republican I'm which I'm notbut the idea that I can't hold certainconservative views I'm walking away fromthe idea that my party can do no wrongI'm walking away from the idea that Ihave to follow my party regardless ofwhat they say and one of the things Inoticed also recently is it doesn'treally matter what someone in your ownparty says so long as it comes from aDemocrat you're okay with it but if itcomes from a Republican even if aDemocrat also agreed with it you'llagree with the Democrat for saying itbut hate the Republican for instanceback in 2008 selection Howard Stern wentto Harlem to talk to some black votersand ask them their opinion of the 2008presidential election they took Obama'spolicy and agendas from his website andto some quotes he said but attributedthose quotes and policies to John McCainand when presented them to the votersthat they were coming across on thestreet the voters were Bement Leeagainst it and then Howard Stern's guytook policy point talking point fromJohn McCain and attributed them toPresident Obama and said what do youthink about that oh it was great becauseObama said it and then campus reform didthe same exact thing just during the2016 election and they didn't just getsome of the most supposedly uneducatedpeople as some people try to criticizeour Stern for going targetting theyreach supposedly educated people whowere literally there in Philadelphia atthe Democratic National Conventioninside the building not just on thestreet or outside and did the same exactthing took policy point talking pointfrom Trump obviously not the most commonbut took some policy talking points fromthe Trump website and campaignattributed them to Hillary Clinton andwhen ax didn't Democrat about it theysaid I can agree with that I like thatand then they flipped it and tooktalking points on Hillary Clinton andattributed them to Dawson Donald Trumplike no no I'm not for that don'tbelieve me you can look it up it didhappen there is a mentality again thatyou are willing to accept anything thatcomes from a Democrat but when anythingis said by a Republican regardless ofwhat it is they can find a cure forcancer oh he is so evil that I am soagainst that cure it's gotten to thatpoint even with this whole North Koreathing it seems like the left wouldrather us go to war with North Korea andKim jong-un than to make some some forma peace with them you know anythingthat's good oh it's bad it's badtax reform thousands and tens ofthousands and tens of thousands peoplegot bonuses thousands of two thousanddollar bonuses and paying increases as aresult of the tax cuts OhNancy Pelosi that's just crumbs that'snothing you know they just start outchump changea thousand dollar bonus is more thanjust chump change maybe to you NancyPelosi with your millions that you'resitting onbut for us just try and get through weekto week you know that's a big deal butagain they crap on any form of positivenews or anything that's attributed tothe other side and I'm walking away fromthat mentality where just because it'sfrom my party I don't care what they sayor do I'm automatically gonna supportthem no I'm gonna be consistentconsistent with my outrage consistentwith calling people out online I'm justwalking towards being an individual andfree thinker that's my walk away storyhopefully everyone has a great timegreat day peace and love[Music]
[Music]well hello my name is Jamie and I'm awalk width I was raised in a normalwhite bread American home in NorthernCaliforniavery conservative parents but they wereregistered Democrat they voted for JFKand we weren't a very political familyas I went through high school andparticipated in my government classesand civics classes I learned a lot aboutpolitics and a lot about both partiesand governor Reagan was our governor atthe time and my youth choir sang for himfor a governor's program prayerbreakfast and I think that kind ofsealed it for me I really like the man Iliked his policies and then I definitelyvoted for him for president and so I'vebeen a conservative my whole lifemy husband was a Democrat however and wehad some pretty good discussions weweren't political families so you knowit was just normal you know Democratswere normal his family his mom wasbeaten up by his dad and pretty bad soshe finally left him with five kids andKings her six kids and came toCaliforniafrom there they they had to depend onthe ball fair system and food stamps andlunch programs and they did and they gotoff and they were all productiveemployed people in the state so you knowthat's what it's for there were manytimes in our marriage when I would makecomments about helping people arefeeling bad for certain groups of peopleand he would accuse me of being aliberal it was never mean-spirited itwas always just light-hearted but thenas time went on he passed in 2011 so Ikind of took a step back from politicsand Obama was president and I didn'tnever cared for him so I just kind oftook a back seat and didn't get involvedwith anything then I started you knowkind of putting my toe back in again andafter Trump was elected and all the hatethat was going on I had to get to thebottom of why there was so much hate andvitriol and calling in every name in thebook and every mainstream media outletwould call him the same thingmisogynist xenophobe racist you knowhomophobic just on and on and on thesame thing over and over and I'm likewhat I don't understand hating anybodylike that anybodyso I started just looking around onTwitter and periscope and differentconservative sites to see get someanswers and I found the walkawaymovement although I've never you knowbeen a liberal I have always had I'vebeen socially liberal but more fiscallyconservative so I needed to get involvedwith this I saw people that were wakingup to the tooth all the hate and walkingaway from the Democratic Party I wouldnever try tofor somebody or you know argue withanybody I think that what finally put meover the edge was last fall I was withmy grown kids we had gone to TopGolfthat day and then we stopped by some oftheir friends house to visit so we werewe were just you know visiting with themthey bought a new house and we wereplaying with their kids I have two smallchildren and and I don't know what Idon't know what was said that brought upthe election and I said well I voted forPresident Trump and the man of the housestarted unloading on me I have never inmy life ever they talk to you that wayby another human being I just set downmy drink and walked out the front doorand just start bawling bawling my eyesout my kids followed me we drove home IIon the way home he called and he didapologize to apologize through my kidsto me for what he had said and you knowI accepted his apology but obviouslyit's I'm not really welcomed at theirhouse ever again and that sadso that's why this movement is soimportant because people are beingbrainwashed by the mainstream mediaapparently I had no idea how liberal hewas when we went over there and I didn'tmean to start anything I was just beinghonest on who I voted for but they saidhe watches CNN religiously all day longit was like the mainstream media just Idon't know why how they can get such ahold of people anyway I'm at a rally inSacramento California for GOP TravisAllen and Brandon struck his hairspeaking so that's why I made the trekfrom Folsom to Sacramento to come hearhim speak so this is my walk away walkwith I will walk with any of youand as I gain more courage I will spreadmore I myself I'm a small business ownerso it's kind of tough sometimes to sharemy beliefs but I don't hide them youknow if I'm asked I won't be honest withpeople but you know after being yelledat by some by somebody the way I was itreally kind of took the wind out of mysails so anyway I will get back to therally just her Brandon speak and it wasamazingI am fully invested in this in thismovement so thanks for listening to meand have a great day[Music]
hello everybody in the walk awaycampaign my name is Sharon I'm having alittle bit of insomnia tonight which iscoupled with a sinus infection that I'vehad and I'm fighting so here I am I'm inmy PJs and thought you know what Ireally am doing Brandon and walk away adisservice by not my roommate byremaining silent I'm a member of theunsilent majority and I want to do myand film I fulfill my duty and tell youa little bit about me I did walk awayfrom the Democrat Party and I did thisseveral years ago I remained a Democratmost of my life and kind of had arealization between about ages 50 and 55that I probably always was a Republicanand share their values most of them butjust didn't realize it because I had nottaken the time to educate myself andstudy to see which party believed inwhat exactly I grew up in the deep southin the state of Arkansas my parents wereDemocrats diehard Democrats theirparents before them and so on that'sjust the way it used to be in the deepsouth the state of Arkansas has done acomplete 180 degree turn they now are ared state thank God and they voteRepublican it's a small populated statevery beautiful state and I'm proud tosay all six of their electoral votes didgo for President Donald J Trump I usedto be pro-choice and I think that wasthe main thingreason that I votedDemocrat I absolutely refused to watchthe news educate myself I thought do Iknow the things is more important Ididn't have timebeing a young busy single mother adivorcee for many years and just didn'tdevote that part of my life to trying tofigure out what platform I reallybelieved in I just would go to the pollsand do my civic duty and be proud ofmyself for that and then I became slowlydisillusioned with a democratic partystarted actually watching Sean Hannityon Fox News at the encouragement of myhusband who swears he has votedRepublican for every campaign except hesaid Bill Clinton fooled him one timeand he actually voted Democrat and washe ever sorry he did not vote for mr.Clinton the second time and so I startedlistening and educating myself andfinally came to the realization by gollyI think I've always been a Republican Ijust didn't know that I was I had justevolved that way the Democrat Party wasknow is nowhere today near like theparty of JFK and what I grew up hearingit's just not it's now a party full ofhate and rage and people who arethreatening to turn our country into asocialist country which would be totaland absolute suicide for all of us and Ibelieve in smaller government lowertaxes and I believe if you earned yourmoney you darn well should be able tohold on to your money then you don'tneed to give anybody a piece of the pieas Michelle Obama quoted and that wasthat ever wrong instead instead shesuggested we might have to share ourpiece of the pie really what she meantwas you need to share all of the by soanyway I became to realize that I alsocould no longer be pro-choice especiallyafter the upcoming birth of my one andonly grandchild who is now 13 the loveof my life she is such an intelligentyoung lady she's wise beyond her yearsand there's no way that I could believein abortion every human being is a humanbeing and I now see abortion is murderplain and simpleso after 9/11 and I was in New York CityI had a fabulous weekend with many of mygirlfriends and one of them from NorthCarolina and I were gonna fly back on9/11 after we sight seed for most of theday that didn't happen and about fourdays later I was able to run a car anddrive us out of New York City and wemade it back safe but the seeds wereplanted in my mindstronger from then that I believe I'mgoing to have to support the RepublicanParty 9/11 was a very big tragedy it wasfor me it was survival getting home andholding my little friend together whowould break down and cry every day andwe got home safely and you know justthought to myself I I believe I've gotto vote Republican and when Sarah Palindecided to join John McCain as hisrunning mateI was very energized fell in love withSarah thought like she did on manypolitical viewsand I had real hope for the party and Ithought it would be awesome to how heris a female president I wasn't that keenon McCain but he was the better choice Isimply could not go Barack Obama andsupport him after all many things Idiscovered about his background and wellwe know how that campaign win and thenMitt Romney and Paul Ryan were the nextstep and I thought wow what a winningteam here two bright intelligent men andI saw them as good peopleunfortunately the Democratic machine andthe mainstream media were in overdriveto defeat mr. Romney for president inany way they could and they did a darngood job on doing it so that didn't workout but that still wasn't discouraged Iknew there had to be somebody out therethere had to be that particularcandidate that would be able to be ourpresident and when and I did not becomeimmediately a Donald Trump fan I wasreally on the Marco Rubio train Ibelieved that we needed new blood sinceboth McCain and Romney were not able topull it off I thought Governor Rocksenator Rubio had a beautiful family andhe represented everything that I thoughtcould make America great again andcoming to our country as a legal citizenhis parents did it worked many jobs tosupport he and his siblings they didthink it's the right way he had awonderful message an uplifting messagewell the way it turned out was slowlysurely Donald truck was ticking each oneof those candidates off and I begin torealize that okay this crude speakingman the one I know as The Apprentice onTV he he's actually making a lot ofsense about a lot of things my husbandand I decided to put our money on himthat he would win and it would we doeverything that we could to ensure thathe won by talking him up with neighborshanding out you know campaign materialsstanding on the street corners wavingAmerican flags honk per truck whateverwhatever we could do we jumped into itand the weekend before the campaign I Ibefore everybody voted I had a reallygood feeling that he was gonna pull thisoff and he did and I was one of thosepeople that partied all night I jumpedup and down and shouted and hooted andhollered and danced and I told myhusband that he could have taken me on avacation anywhere in the world and Iwould not have had a better night orenjoyed it more than I did the electionnight and that's a truth so I until weintend to support Donald Trump to helpensure that he wins his second termreally believed he could pull it offthere's nothing nobody is runningagainst him but idiots I mean give me abreak and President Trump has reallybeen coming forward with every campaignpromise that he can and he's full filledso many of those promises even as wellas a view that I didn't know that he wasgoing to do and also equally excitedabout when I heard about Brandon's dropat first when I heard Brandon'ssix-minute video over how long it is Iwasn't sure that he was on the up-and-upand I wanted to be sure before I youknow suffer some kind of embarrassmentlike okay this walk away is greatI wasn't sure that I wasn't gonna beslapped in the face slowly but surely Icould see he's the real thing and Ithink it's just the greatest thing tohappen the walkaway campaign sincePresident Trump was voted into officeand sorry if I sound funny or I'm alittle bit of an insomniac and I have abad sinus infection tonight and

hi guys my name is kalika mokwen andthis is my walk away videoi've been a democrat my entire life ivoted for barack obama in 2008 and 2012and i voted forum hillary clinton in 2016. icried the night that trump won icouldn't eat for three daysi was depressed it felt like a reallybad breakup and i spent the next fouryearsvoicing my opinion very loudly onfacebookand to anyone that would listen about mydislike for trump i shared everynegative article from occupy democratsto cnn and everything betweenon him and i got into it a lot of timeswith my republican friends whoyes i do have a lot of republicanfriends and democrat friendsi didn't ever belittle their view oropinion i felt like i was prettyrespectfulbut i got into it with them and a lot ofdebatesand even though we disagreed on a lot ofthings they never unfriended methey never made me feel like i was lessum for having an opinion they just kindof tried to educate meon their side of the view and sometimesi would be open to it listenand a lot of times i wouldn't most thetime i just as liberals liberalstypically doi would just kind of shut down what theywere saying or move onso my first red flag with the democratparty came in 2018.my son was diagnosed with autism in 2017and it led me down a whole rabbit holeof vaccines andi know that is that question do vaccinescause autism for my sonwe noticed this regression right afterhis mmr vaccine nota little over a year old so that waseither a coincidenceor it's a vaccine injury i'm not adoctor i'm not a scientist i don't knowthe answerbut i question it and when i expressedthat on facebook when i saidhey has anyone seen vex has anyone seenthe truth about vaccines what are yourthoughts on thismy son was diagnosed with autism and ithink it might have a lot to do with hismmr vaccinethe way i was attacked was nothing likei'd experienced before at least had notexperienced like since high schooli was called a tin hat lady i was calleda science denieri was called stupid i was told to do myresearchum and which that's what i had beendoing was my research which is why i wasquestioning what i've been told i feellike there's two different people inthislife there are people that just doeverything they're told withoutquestioning it and there's people whoactuallyquestion the status quo so i wasquestioning the status quo and for thati was attacked and really i feel nowthat i was attackednot because they disagree with me butthey refused to have their narrativechallenged that was threatening to themfor me to come forward and say hey whatyou know and what youbelieve might be wrong and for that iwas attacked sothat was strike one and i got over itand i continued my trump rantsall the way up until january february ofthis yearstrike two for me were the lockdowns iown a dj management companyand at the end of february even beforewe went to lockdown i started getting alot of cancelled workum i had one dj who lost over tenthousand dollars in gigs for the monthof marchi had another dj who was booked for acruise the entire cruise got cancelledit was his work all summerum i had the casinos calling saying heywe have conventions canceled so we needto cancelour lounge djs for the whole month sothat was there goes their workand these guys have children to feedthey have bills to paythey are solely dependent on this incomeand ivoice my concern for this publicly i waslike hey does anyone else notice thatthe direction we're going in thingsmight shut down people might lose workdo we have a plan be in place for thiswhat's going to happenand i was called selfish i was calledjust horrible names stupid a bad personi can't even count the mountain times iwas called terrible person for havingcompassion and caringabout not so much myself but about thepeople that i represent and i know thatcount on me and count on this workfor income to survive so that was reallystrike two for me strike three were thegeorge floyd protesti had people who werea week before these protests startedcalling me a grandma killer for going tothe pool with a couple of my friendswhile i had a mask on for being soselfish to want to get some sun and somepool timein these exact same people were then outin downtown los angelesin crowds of 60 000 people holding upsigns withall of their friends and i get thereason they're doing it i'm not[ __ ] stupid i get it is for animportant reasonbut it doesn't make it any more [ __ ]safeand when i would tell them this theythink oh well you are selfish you wantto be at a pool partywe are doing it for social justice yes iunderstand thatbut you are telling me that cobidspreads when you are less than six feetfrom a person and this is exactly whatyou're doingso you're very it's hypocritical i'msorry whatever you already want to cutitit's freaking hypocritical so that wasstrike three for mestrike four was to cancel culture andcensoring everything i believe in thefirst amendment i believe in the powerof your voice i think it's so importantand now anything that you say someone onthe leftwill take out a context andjust abuse you for it they willscreenshot it they'll send it to otherpeoplethey'll keep posting it on your post foruntil the end of time they will try toget you firedi own my own business i've actually hadpeople emailingthe email on my business trying to getme fired and the email comes to me andit's likewait they wanted to get me fired forwhat for that like it wasn't evenanything bad that i saidthey just don't agree with it they don'tagree with it so so they will pick apartyour wordsand make it fit their own narrativeabout what they don't like about youso that was strike four strike five ithink strike five i know at this pointwho's even countingit it's been too much uh strike five wasthe schools i have two little kids theygo to public schoolsi want them around to their friends iwant them in class uh dr fauci hadactually come forward and says there'sno reason that the schools need to beclosed and i am seeing my friends thathave kids that go to private schoolswith themdoing in person classes so what i'mtaking from this is if you have fifteenthousand dollars a year per child andyou can afforda private education you are safe fromcopen but if you do notor you do not want to pay this to sendyour child to a private schoolyou aren't safe from covid and you'restuck at home with zero solution forworking parentsfor single moms they're just telling usall to figure it outand if you raise your voice that you'reconcerned about it againyou're shellfish you will get shut downbythe left so those are all the reasonsthat'sat least five reasons i gave there isjust nothingleft for me on the left at this point iwill be voting republican for the firsttime this yearum i was invited to join the walkwaycampaign i believe back in april and isilently sat there reading everyone'stestimonies ibefriended a couple of you guys uh andyou've been greatum and then inspired by the testimoniesand i've been looking forward to doingthis for a long time and contributing toit sothank you um and i really hope that ourcountry makesthe right decision um in november and iwill for the first timebe voting for donald trump yes hell isfrozen over
what is up Instagram YouTube whereveryou're watching this from I just want tomake this video real quick I made videosbefore about my political views but Ifeel like I want to reiterate because ofa movement that struck the internetwaves called the walk away movementwhere people are talking about why theyleft the Liberal Democratic Partywhatever you want to call it um I wasraised a Democrat I was raised tobelieve that you know Republicansconservatives who are old-schoolright-wing racists who wanted to keepAmerica like the 1940s or the slaverytimes you know I was brought todifferent political events as a kid nowall that kind of stuff I was actually atObama's very first inauguration I wasthere in the audience I was in eighthgrade when he got elected I was inmiddle school 13 years old so yeah Iwent to his second inauguration but Istayed in the hotel cause it was way toocold and I was like I'm not doing thisagain so I stayed in the hotel with mybrother other people that I was withattended the inauguration I campaignedfor Obama I campaigned for otherDemocratic politicians without everlooking at them or their track record Ijust believed that oh I'm black sotherefore I should you know be aDemocrat because black people areDemocrats white people are racist whitepeople in particular are Republicanswhatever whatever but later on I foundout about things like the Illuminati theshadow government or whatever you wantto call it and the more I got into JesusChrist I noticed that my political mylife views were more so in tune withthings that people would call moreconservative and I remember back in whenI was growing up when you would callsomebody conservative it didn't mean apolitical party it meant that they weremore you know reserved about theirlifestyle and their choices and all thatkind of stuff so if somebody didn'tdrink or they weren't promiscuous a ohyou promiscuous you would say oh she's aconservative girl you know but sorryguys later on it was really during thetwentyseen election cycle where I saw howmalicious the the left was being likeeverybody loved Donald Trump blackpeople included he was an idol to a lotof black people rappers would make songsabout him rappers and all differenttypes of people would hang out with himeverybody loved Donald Trump until hebecame a candidate for the 2016 electioncycle or not running as a Democrat theneverybody said he was a racist he was sosexist he did this and this and this andthat and everybody was coming out of theWoodworks with an evil story to tellwhen just like a couple years beforepeople were making songs like up likeTrump and like my Donald Trump money andall of that kind of stuff so I was onsocial media and this was the very firsttime I was able to vote in apresidential election and I I couldn'tvote for Hillary I just couldn't and Icouldn't vote for her because I reallyresearch to research her historyresearch the type of person that she wasand my better consciousness would notlet me vote for Hillary I couldn't do itso I did vote for our current presidentand I will vote for him again in 2020and just seeing how the left has becomeor is extremely dehumanizing they arenot into logic it's all about youremotions it's all about I feel like thisso therefore it's fact and when you tryto hit them with the facts even basicfacts like the history of their ownparty like how Margaret Sanger whostarted Planned Parenthood was actuallya member of the KKK she spoke to womenin the KKK and said we don't want wordto go out that we actually are trying toexterminate the Negro race she was intoyou gen --ax she was into sterilizingblack women which she did giving blackwomen hysterectomies and Hillary Clintonsaid that Margaret Sanger is her idoland also things like the Clintons andHaiti and all of these different typesof things and just how if you are not aDemocrat you are just evil you're a Naziyou are this you are that it's justdehumanizing abortion you know even howthe Democrats actuallythe slaves and you can't tell peoplethat because they just don't believe youbut and they like I said founded the KuKlux Klan and all of these differentthings so I got off the Democratplantation and I noticed that you knowthere's a quote that says if you do thesame thing over and over and expect thesame different results that's insanityso voting for these Democrats over andover and over and over and they're doingnothing for inner cities they're doingnothing for black people they're doingnothing except turning right around youknow Maxine Waters her district inCalifornia that she's been elected in torun for so many years it looked like thepoorest County or the poorest districtin California it looks like a tornadojust ran through the place like Iliterally saw a video of it the otherday and I was just in shock because whatis she doing she shouldn't be runningaround telling people to hurt Trumpsupporters she should go and fix whatshe's supposed to fix but she's not umso yeah guys I just wanted to talk aboutthe walkaway movement why I personallywalked away I don't see myself everreturning to the Democrat Party um soyeah that's that's just I just wanted tosay that if you think that you know yourfeelings towards me change it doesn'tmatter I don't really care but I'm not ahateful person I don't hate anybody Idon't hate anyone because they're gay orthey're whatever I anything like thatlike I literally love everybody umthat's just my political views like justthat I'm not a Democrat I just I'm notso yeah I hope you guys have a great dayI just want to explain that and justmake this little video and say that yoif you want to walk away don't be afraiddon't be ashamed people are gonna saywhatever they want regardless and don'tlet anybody stereotype you just becauseyou're black just because you're gayjust because you're whatever doesn'tmean that you can be a free thinker likemy boy Kanye West said and Candace Owensand ya guys stay strong and stay awesomeI love you guysregardless of what you think or what youbelieve and God loves you too so yeah itdoesn't matter God is above politics andno matter who's the president Jesus isthe king of kings anyway so it's allgood anyways y'all have a great one stayawesome peace

hey guys I just wanted to share my not abot testimonial thing with you guys inmy room you can see my flag on the wallclassic sign of a bachelor but anywayslet's see started as an independent inmy youth stuff like thatI definitely bots but let's see I didn'tlike to call myself conservative orDemocrat because I thought the two-partysystem was a little silly and you shouldbe able to be a free thinker and allthat kind of stuff I grew up right whereI am living now in Las Vegas I'm aveteran of the army traveled the worldcame back to Vegas although I keptsaying I wouldn't became a teacher andalthough I did mostly vote Republican Idid often she was a Democrat from timeto time because of you know some oftheir views different things like thatbut then let's see I joined the armytraveled the world and everything likethat and I started to see thingsdifferently I saw how I could get alongwith people of all races cultures peoplefrom different countries all over theworld worked with Muslims in mydeployments all things like that so yeahI basically got a little bit more of aconservative viewpoint that grew on meover time and then I became a teacher inVegas and that was like crazy Trump getselected and the school I was working atliterally had the principal have ameeting with us and to tell us that thekids would come in that day and theywould be scared and we had to reassurethem that no one's gonna come and takethem away from their parents and kidnapthem and do send them to another countryand one of the reassurances that theytold us to give was that trumpet isn'tactually president yet something couldstill happen and I'm like what are youguys telling these people you're tellingthese kids that they should be afraidbecause Trump is president it's going tobe President but hey something may stopthat what are you thinking he's gonna bekilled what are you thinking they'regonna try stopping him in some othercrazy way I mean legally elected youliterally have to get rid of theConstitution to make this work and thisis the argument that they were tellingus to tell these kids that and then theyliterally as they were talking were theprincipal and some of the people werelike yeah I'm scared too and they'relike yeah me too ha the making it tryingto like light it up but because of howscared everyone was and I am sittinghere thinking oh my goodness if I tellthese people I'm a Republican or that Ivoted for Trump they are going to likeattack me it was crazy but even now Istill with my students sit down and Italk to them and I explain the life tothem and I'm like don't think like whatother people just tell you to do thinkfor yourself ask questions look stuff upI had some girls in my classes past year3rd grade class and the these girls weresaying I should have voted for Clintonand stuff like that and I'm like I tellthem what the big getting Benghaziincident and I tell him about a coupleof the things that happened with her andthey were like oh never mind why weshouldn't vote for her but we saw I'mwriting for Trump and I'm like that'sfine you don't have to yeah well foranyone you don't want to but don't justvote for someone just because they havea Democrat next to their name and thatreminds me of a time when I was inWashington State and as I was sittingthere filling up my little write votingslip a few years ago this was bound wayto ten years ago by now can't rememberyeahbut during one of the elections and Iwas voting for the and I was voting andstuff like that and here is these peoplein the table and they're me and they'reliterally saying who should I vote forand the person next to them says votefor the D marked the D that's it therewas no concept of this is what theybelieve this is what they think this iswhat they do and then I always use thatas the example for why the electoralsystem is neededand not the popular vote because peoplevote for who they took who they're toldto the time when their if you have anelectoral system you have to have thetwo you have to have the two-partysystem they think they go together ifyou want to get rid of any and allparties and only do popular vote becauseyou're saying okay this person believesthis in this only I can go with thatbut it has to be no parties you can'teven hint that this person is or was asocialist or whatever but that's my takejust my opinionokay I'm not sure if there's anything ohyeah one more thing to say just one moreI promiseI tried not to make this too long I'm aChristian yes and one of the reasons whyI really wanted to join this group isbecause not only my walk away from theconcept of independent to conservatismbut I am also a believer in walking withwith anyone who wants to have adifference of opinion of mine becausewhy because that's what makes Americagreat that's what makes this land greatI love it I love that we can have aconversation and not hate each other soI leave with this final mark whoever youare LGBT sorry if I said it wrong Ithink I said it rightMuslim atheist Wicca vampire I do knowthey're out there I knew of you whoeveryou are wherever you are I love you Ilove you all all of you no matter whoyou are where you are I love you all andI hope the world to you the world isthere with you and I will stand by youwherever you aregod bless you I love America[Music]
todayi officially hashtagwalked away yes i finally did iti started realizing that i wasn't ademocrat when democrats were voting formandated vaccineswhich are really changing the lifestyleof childrenand their families not just theirlifestyle their dnatheir whole body anyways i'm not goingto get intovaccines and the harmful effects ofvaccines but that'sreally what opened my mind up to likewhy would democrats want to sell outtheir own peopleand then the whole hunter biden it's allreal guys i don't know why anybody wouldcontinue to vote forfor people to harm children into officethere's only one candidatethe most american donald jtrump he's got our backgo vote
by this my walk away story just give youbrief background on me just a normalheterosexual white male so I'm the enemyobviously of everyone but uh I grew upmy mom made sure I grew up in diverseManor I went to a grade school in whichit was literally required that it be 50%minorities 50% white in every classroom50% of the teachers white 50% black Imean literally all the way the principalwas black the Vice removal whitestraight up so that's how I thought theworld workedand then I hit junior high and I went toa totally different type of school thatthat was a magnet school I went toregular public school close to myneighborhood and then it was a 90/10ratio where it was 90% black 10% whiteso I was the monday morty and then uhthen i moved and then i'm basicallywithin a country type school where itflipped and it was ninety ten againwhere it was ninety percent white andten percent minority so i've livedthrough all different ways my mom grewup I grew up with my mom it was alwaysliberal this Democrat you know DemocratDemocrat Republicans always say alrightif you're not rich they hate youwhatever they're gonna starve you blahblah blah blah blah that's what italways was with Republicans they wasstarving us so I became voting age forthe first vote I voted out gore I couldnot bring myself to vote for John Kerryso we were in middle of war let thepresident that started the war keeprolling with it so I went Bush that timethat was my logic and wasn't verypolitical then Obama came along I sawhim on open like everybody else and shepicked out our president I listened tohim I ate it up spoon fed it all rightinto me second time aroundhe got my vote I was getting a littleleery of him but you know to be realhonest with you he killed bin Laden hegot bin Laden maybe he didn't get binLaden but he got bin Laden theyannounced he got bin Ladenthat was good enough for my vote rightthere he got bin Laden so you think whatyou want 2014 rolled around and thingsweren't going quite the way Obama saidthey were gonna go and then I startedreading I always grew up just I watchedCNN hardcore I'm 12 hours a day everyday MSNBC flip between those all-timeI've watched Fox News - occasionallyjust for last really because I thinkit's nonsense I laugh at it so uh oneday I was watching and I was hanging itwas Hannity and I was like man they saythis guy's racist but he didn't surlycome off racist so I went and startedlooking stuff up and I realized Obamawas just full of and then then Irealized that there was a massbrainwashing going on because you say alie enough times and you can get peopleto believe it's real simple and you lookat it and everything that they said waseverything was about race evereverything's racist everything's racisteverything is like that can't possiblybe racist and you look into it and it'snot really racist it's just them tryingto hide people up to make everybody nutsand uh I've been a fan of Donald Trumpfor years he come down that escalatorand I was jumping up and down I I wasI'm Trump Trump's my guy Trump's where'smy there's my hatyeah Trump's my guy so uh he come downthat escalator I went to that Networkthe next day and started a campaign andeveryone there they're like he's notgonna be present like who you gonna votefor Hillary I was like he's Google's hername and mysterious murders and there'slike 50 links come up next to it I don'twant to vote for someone like that andespecially after I read all the stuff soI switched I voted for Trump I lost atleast half the people on my friends liston Facebook at least half

because there's awhole different place you got to read itand you'll know you can get referencesfrom the TV sure but don't eat thatstuff up like it with a spoon just don'tdo ityouby this my walk away story just give youbrief background on me just a normalheterosexual white male so I'm the enemyobviously of everyone but uh I grew upmy mom made sure I grew up in diverseManor I went to a grade school in whichit was literally required that it be 50%minorities 50% white in every classroom50% of the teachers white 50% black Imean literally all the way the principalwas black the Vice removal whitestraight up so that's how I thought theworld workedand then I hit junior high and I went toa totally different type of school thatthat was a magnet school I went toregular public school close to myneighborhood and then it was a 90/10ratio where it was 90% black 10% whiteso I was the monday morty and then uhthen i moved and then i'm basicallywithin a country type school where itflipped and it was ninety ten againwhere it was ninety percent white andten percent minority so i've livedthrough all different ways my mom grewup I grew up with my mom it was alwaysliberal this Democrat you know DemocratDemocrat Republicans always say alrightif you're not rich they hate youwhatever they're gonna starve you blahblah blah blah blah that's what italways was with Republicans they wasstarving us so I became voting age forthe first vote I voted out gore I couldnot bring myself to vote for John Kerryso we were in middle of war let thepresident that started the war keeprolling with it so I went Bush that timethat was my logic and wasn't verypolitical then Obama came along I sawhim on open like everybody else and shepicked out our president I listened tohim I ate it up spoon fed it all rightinto me second time aroundhe got my vote I was getting a littleleery of him but you know to be realhonest with you he killed bin Laden hegot bin Laden maybe he didn't get binLaden but he got bin Laden theyannounced he got bin Ladenthat was good enough for my vote rightthere he got bin Laden so you think whatyou want 2014 rolled around and thingsweren't going quite the way Obama saidthey were gonna go and then I startedreading I always grew up just I watchedCNN hardcore I'm 12 hours a day everyday MSNBC flip between those all-timeI've watched Fox News - occasionallyjust for last really

startedlooking stuff up and I realized Obamawas just full of and then then Irealized that there was a massbrainwashing going on because you say alie enough times and you can get peopleto believe it's real simple and you lookat it and everything that they said waseverything was about race evereverything's racist everything's racisteverything is like that can't possiblybe racist and you look into it

what's up my Facebook friends how areyou today how are you today I am on myway to do a delivery real quick butwhile I'm on my way like to have alittle conversation hold on one secondhere go my girls coming down the streetso daddy's gonna do some illegal drivingI'm going to work love you ladies seeyou laterokay so I've had a very interestingweekend I've read a lot hello Rita howare you could see you okayso I've had a very interesting weekendread a lot of very interesting thingsand listen to a lot of politicalanalysts and some of the words they weresaying and some of the hate exclusionthat we're being preached now you knowseriously I told him I this weekend mymain reason for walking away from theDemocratic Party is simply because theyhave no plan no Direction no purpose andthat obviously has no futureyou don't have a plan you don't have adirection you don't have a purpose orfocus you have no future it's just notimpossible you have no way of looking atgrowth you have no idea of how you wantto grow and growing on hate is not wherethis country should be it's supposed tobe wants to be this time a moment helloJanet how are youhope you don't well so basically Iwalked away from the hate the hatefulrhetoric because that's what Iconsidered it I considered it right nowmostly hateful rhetoric I see no nogrowth no and making anybody better noeven not even trying to make the countrybetter at this time a moment when Ithink President Trump is doing some goodthings and nobody wants to see anythinghe does as a good thing no matter whathe does he's an evil races liar dead umis no good no matter what he does forthis country nobody wants to seeanything he does is a good thingand of course that is completelynonsense and it only means that you'reonly sticking to your agenda you stickit to your side your deepen your afoxhole of limitations and we'resupposed to be a free country of ourLibertyso we should be able to listen to talkto have a conversation with everybodybuild a relationship and try to goforward in a direction of progress witheverybody what's up mark how are youtrying to wave here so I'm just walkingaway from the hate even my languageswill switch up a little bit latelylately I was just last night um guystalked about you know white supremacyand racism and how its systemic and allthis andI kind of understand what they're comingfrom energy-wisebecause if you keep any of that upthroughout the generations that youteach it to your children that's whatyou're gonna get the systemic part I'mtrying to I'm trying to understand thatand get it to listening to a lot ofpeople right now and it talking abouthow everything seems to be racist forthem concerning know what is immigrationis racist what is even tipping othersthat they was racistI don't know how dead works so what kindof I'm gonna have to read into it I wasreally confused about that one tippingis racistyes I'm it's like saying capitalism isracism that makes no sense makes nosense what do you bring to the tablethere's pretty much more creak whatcapitalism is are you creating somethingthat's worthwhile to the customer or areyou notthat's what capitalism is how are youcreated with racismI guess I'm I have to go back and listento somebody somebody else and figuredout what now but anyway I want to stepaway from the hate because I had thisconversation with my wife the other dayand we were talking about immigrationand people that have been here butthey're still trying to deport or thathave been here 20 years or somethinglike that and I was like you know an onthat point I understand if this personhas been in America over 20 years andthey actually been helping the countryyou know pushing us forward making abusiness I'm helping their familywhatever they're making progress in asuccessful American ways I would say andthen yes I think they should be you knowgreat putting the system of course thethrough the process of legal immigrationbut to just bring people in new whohaven't been here for five minutes andeverybody is seeking asylum and you knowwe're giving everybody welfare and allthis other stuff that makes no senseyou're not taking care of your basefirst you take care of everybody elsethat's kind of ludicrous I want somebodyto help me make sense of thatI want somebody to help me make sense ofthat because some that one I'm kind oflost on because a lot of the immigrantsI know work to get here their familiesthat work through generation to get hereif they build things to get here sosaying we're just gonna let everybody inand and just pay their way I'll takecare of them know that you don't have toexplain that one to me and work that oneout for me I'm not getting on that oneum and like I said before and a wholelot of siloam thing everybody doesn'tget asylum it's only for the ones whoare running from political situationsand a lot of times we don't know who'srunning from political situations but umlike I said before the hate has gottastopwe got to do better people we got totalk better to each other we gotta havea better communication we've gotta havebetter relationships we can't just keepup this ignorant regular rhetoric thatthe Congress and the president I'm goingback and forth and yes both of them aresaying ignorant dumb things that theyshould just keep the mouth on because alot of it is an emotional battle andyou're saying dumb things you're gettingpeople emotionally involved but nobody'sactually looking at the point of what'sactually helping the country and that'sthat's not cool that's not cool at allbut anyway I'm on my first job of todayon this job anyway I got a couple andlet me get off here but the message issimple people stop the hate walk awayfrom the hate no matter who's saying itwalk away from the hate we got to dobetter we are intelligent human beingsand a lot of our problem is some reasonwe keep looking for other people togovern us govern our thoughts govern ourminds when we can't govern ourselves andthat is a serious issue a serious issuebut anyway let me quit talking I wasonly supposed to be here for fiveminutesand I got his work thought you laterthis is DC I'm out have a great dayd intense fit way piece
my name is Adam and this is my long walkaway story growing up Muslim in a smallTexas townI've always been firmly placed in thesocial status of other I read somewherethat if your first American tragedy was9/11 then that means you're a millennialmeaning if you're too young to rememberVietnam or the cold war but you're oldenough to remember 9/11 then you're amillennialwell I remember certain moments of 9/11but what I remember most is the way myfellow school mates treated me beforeand after at that time it was probablylegitimately racism considering the factthat as a small Texas town and thatreally set the foundation for how Iviewed the worldI was basically trained from a young ageto constantly feel like the other likethe one who isn't immediately acceptedin the desirable social group they usedto play this game where if I ever touchthem or rubbed up against them whilewalking walking by them or anything likethat they pretended that wherever I Ihad touched them was like an infectedarea and they would take their hand andwipe it on the infected area and thenwipe it on someone else and the worstpart was they weren't even doing it inhiding they wanted me to see it so thatwas my elementary school middle schoolin high school so I was very intimatelyacquainted with the more shelteredpopulation of our country that had neverbeen exposed to someone of a differentfaith actually my best friend today grewup in Oklahoma and until middle schoolhe didn't really even understand theconcept of not believing in God muchless being non-christian or atheist orespecially a different religion thatdoesn't revolve aroundJesus Christ so you could say I wasdefinitely predisposed to the liberalismwell I should say the leftism of mycollege years I've always been big onlanguages my grandma taught me or dogrowing up and I took extensive Spanishand Latin in high school I took Chinesefor the first two years of my collegelife and this is where I would hear theword feminism for the first time I don'teven remember what we were talking aboutbut offhandedly my Chinese professor hegoes and you guys know I'm a feminist Ibelieve in equal rights for men andwomen and that was my entireintroduction into the ideology offeminism so it was presented to me soappurely and innocently as equal rightsfor men and women what rational personwould reject such a natural idea and itfit right in with the central tenets Iwas taught growing up namely of Honorhonor that anyone is capable ofregardless of gender or anything elserespect they you give everyone even ifthey don't give it to you andselfishness a self selflessness which Iam proud to say I learned from my fatherI helped develop and grow the MuslimStudent Association at my university andgreatly expanded its event sizes andfrequency as far as left as far as farleft ideals go I had a very strong moralcompass that I inherited from my parentsthat kept me mostly on the straight andnarrow at first I didn't protect me fromsome of the ideas that existed on thefringe for example I had no problem inbelieving that there were some men whoparticipated in the acts of mansplainingand manspreading and then I accepted thenotion that equal outcome might havesome wisdom I embraced the idea of thepatriarchy in its totality and believedthat as a man I had a duty to check mycisgender heterosexual privilege and actas an ally to those who areunderrepresented I believed thatintersectional feminism was the newtruth that would ensure that all voiceswere heard and that I was one of thebest and most listened to members ofsociety to help further that end as aMuslim I basked in the notion ofIslamophobia and that it was justflat-out unacceptable for others toquestion my religion in any way as ourcountry had a white imperialist and awhite oppressor history problem and Iwas justified in speaking out againstthe oppressive establishment so Icontinued along this route slowly beingcorrupted at one point I found myselfarguing with my father a doctor withsignificant accreditation and trainingthat the differences in body sizes ofmen and women were a result of culturalexpectations and if women were allowedto compete with men their bodies wouldadjust to compensate and that we wouldsee gender parity in all fields in 50yearsat the time my dad just kind of laughedin my face I thought I had won theargument but even if I was outward evenif I was inwardly trotting down a pathof leftism I was never very outwardlypolitical I cared much more about mymusic my clubs my entrepreneurshipreally anything else I didn't reallygive myself time to focus on thesepolitical Inklings in order to reallycare that much so I continued in thisway for a time working toward my musicdegree then in the summer of 2017my father was accused of sexual assaultsmy world fell apart I remember that daylike it was yesterdaypacing back and forth in my apartment mymom's words ringing in my ears talkingquickly with my law student friend aboutwhat the hell is going on what it meansthat my father was accused and what isgonnahappen over the next few weeks hismedical license was stripped away fromhim and since only doctors with licensescan own medical facilities he couldn'twork and was forced to sell his practicefor bottom dollar in a rush and thatmarked the beginning of the biggestchange of the biggest stage of flux inmy life which I am in fact still in so Ifinished up school graduated in Decemberand I found it difficult to focus onanything at all I just could notunderstand how my father one of the goodones not one of those men who rape wasaccused I was stuckideologically I couldn't move past whereI was I had no tools to process theevents that had occurred that's when Icame across a video on YouTube calledmeeting the enemy a feminist comes toterms with the men's rights movement inthe video Cassie J explains her feministbeliefs which I agreed with a hundredpercent every time she mentionedsomething but then something amazinghappened she began to question thosebeliefs and she talked about herquestioning process I found myselfagreeing with those newfound beliefs100% as well so basically I was able tofollow her logic in the video from startto end and felt like someone hadinserted a key into the lock box of myheart and pulled forth from it how I wasreally feeling I was hooked right away Iwent on a YouTube rampage watching everysingle video I could find dealing withthe men's rights movement the secondvideo I watched after Cassie J's TEDtalk was Warren Farrell's TED talk andhe explained how boys are suffering froma lack of positive representation andvirtually every facet of both real lifeand any kind of media and thatincreasingly boys are losing male rolemodels in the form of fatherlessness hisTED talk moved me to tears I moved on toCass CJ's YouTube channel and startedwatching her unedited interviews thatshe had uploaded up to that point andthen my dad's trial arrived almost ayear after the accusations came outthe jury found my dad guilty in 12minutes he was sentenced 12 years for acrime he most certainly did not commit Iwas completely and totally crushed thatnight was probably the worst night of mylife as my dad and all the rest of uscried pretty much non-stop for hours andhours and hours I had never heard my dadmake noises like that and they were thesounds of a man whose dignity had beenstripped from him unfairly after my dadwent to jailI couldn't stop exploring this Avenue ofmen's rights I exhausted the interviewsCassie J had on her YouTube channel so Idecided to purchase her documentary thered pill I discovered Karen strong andthe honey badgers and I've lost atleasta month of my life to their videos Ifelt my beliefs turned inside out upsidedown and sliced up into little tinypieces I didn't know what to believe atthis point I was so broken that nothingmade senseone day literally as I was sitting onthe toilet I started to cryuncontrollably and violently sorry forthe disgusting image I'm just trying toillustrate how although I really wentand for any avatar nerds out there it'slike when aang says to korra when youare at your lowest point you are open tothe greatest change i had neverunderstood that quote more than at thatmoment when i had absolutely zero hopein anything and i had no idea what tobelieve the despair I felt at thatmoment I really really don't wish thaton anyoneI was completely broken down reduced tonothing literally my foundation wasripped up and there was nothingleft of my previous beliefs but all ofthat was extremely necessary once Ibroke all that crap down and got it outof my system I started to rebuild rebootreorganize and readjust I started tolisten to everything the thing Irealized was you don't just have asingle red pill moment it isn't like thematrix where reality and illusion aretwo very distinct worlds and you takethe pill one time and then you wake upin reality and from then on you canalways tell what's real and what's notit's more like taking the red pillsimply allows you to understand the factthat there even is an illusion then forthe rest of your life you have to keeppunching holes in that illusion a lot oftimes you won't even see that theillusion is there and then you'll learnsomething new that breaks a new hole init and this has happened to me too manytimes one of the biggest things Ilearned was that in feminism's missionto bring equality to the world itdecided to place ends over means I readchristina hoff sommers books especiallywho stole feminism and i learned abouthow news outlets would rununsubstantiated claims from feministsources and never truly retract theirstatements I learned daily from TimPoole on YouTube that they still do thisI learned about threat narratives fromAllison teaming and how we just keepmaking new ones all the time and don'teven realize it I learned from the greateconomist Thomas Sol about how blacks inAmerica were actually doing bettereconomically before the civil rightsmovement oh and very importantly Ilearned that Trump wasn't completelyevil and then I started to learn abouthow those who had gone down this pathbefore me were shown no mercy they werevilified most swiftly I watched as thosepolitical heroI had very newly discovered such as DaveRubin were being torn down by smearcampaigns which were absolutely untrue Ibegan to see with my own two eyes thehypocrisy with which those who tell mento share their feelings actually condemnmen for the very feelings they have it'shappened to me and the greatest thing totop it all off the great icing on thecake that not only served as arepresentation of all the new filmpent-up beliefs I had discovered butalso served as a catalyst for me to sayscrew everything I'm gonna be honestabout Who I am and what I believe andthat was or that is the internationallypublicized hearing all over TVand everything else at the time of thisvideo that has to do with the nominationof

I have been following the walk awaymovement and I couldn't stay silent Ihave to add my voice I've been sofrightened to speak out over the lastyear and this movement has made merealize how important it is to make surethat my voice is heard and that my voiceis added to the what is it now a millionpeople that are talking about this sovery quickly like many people in thismovement I was a Bernie supporter Ivoted for him in the primaries I endedup choosing to vote for Clinton in theactual election per an email I receivedfrom the Bernie campaign maybe a weekweek or two before you know the actualelection she asked all of his followersto vote for her I ignored the fact thatI didn't trust her and took hisdirection I wish that I had him inhindsight I don't know if I vote forBernie today but I should have stuck tomy principles and written him in Iregret that I didn't do thatbut once Trump won like many people Iwas afflicted with Trump derangementsyndrome as it's being referred to Ithink I even even outright said onFacebook that if you're my friend andyou voted for Trumpyou should unfriend me I I feel horriblethat I acted that way towards somepeople that had been friends of mine fora long timeand if if you're watching this and youwant to continue that conversation my myears are open now and a big part of thatinitial opening that that blindfoldcoming down was actually seeing theresponse to my LOI innopolis appearanceat Berkeley in February of 2017 I'm sureyou guys remember the footage youremember people going absolutely insanebreaking windows throwing I think oneone guy was throwing a podium orsomething I don't know people were goingcrazy and I thought oh my god that thisguy must be the Nazi that that everyonesays he is for them to act this way andI actually made the mistake of lookinginto what he was actually saying ofcourse I don't agree with everything hesays I don't think any of us agree witheverything that Milo says but I'd betotally remiss if I didn't thank him forthat initial i opening that initialblindfold slippage seeing how some of myleft friends were reacting to a youngman showing up at a college wanting tospeak it went against every ideal i heldas an american as a staunch defender ofthe Constitution freedom of speech isincredibly important to me I'm an actorI am an artist I am a writer if I didn'thave my First Amendment right I wouldn'thave any of the things that bring me joyin life to see people that I thoughtwere reasonable actually advocating thatother people should have their freedomof speechlimited because we don't agree with themthat is the most insane scary concept Ican't even I can't even fathom thatthere are people I call friends thatbelieve that and it was those samefriends that then sort of contributed tofurther pushing me away starting to tryto talk about this starting to try totalk about the things I was seeing toexpress concern about people that wereadvocating for the limiting of ourrights for the limiting of ourconstitutional rights it it it blows mymind to think about it and to havefriends call you a racist call yousexist call you an anti-feminist becauseyou believe that everyone should betreated equally all it does is justfurther alienate me and alienate therest of us and push us towards oneanother and inspire this movement thatwe need to talk about the worst of itfor me was a couple weeks ago when Istarted talking about border control andimmigration I don't see how wanting astrong working immigration policy iswrong I don't see how that makes me abigotbut I was talking to my mother about itthe other week andand she turned and looked at meand made a derogatory comment about mywhiteness she is Hispanic I am mixedI've been made fun of my whole life forbeing mixed for never fitting in withthe white people never fitting in withthe brown people being told by one halfthat I'm too dark being told by theother half I'm too light I've neverreally felt a part of any kind of racialidentity maybe that's why I reallyidentify as being an American being anAmerican is something that surpassescolor it surpasses creed it it evensurpasses country of origin this is anamazing country and I love being anAmerican and I love anyone who holdsAmerican ideals up so highly that theywould be willing to leave their homecountry to come here I I'm so for thatI'm so all about that and to have my ownmother turn and look at me and use myrace as an insult I don't think any anyany mother should do that I don't thinkanyone who really loves you and caresabout you should do that and that waswhy I decided to add my voice to thismovement because I am very scared tospeak up and talk about how I feelI i'm not even conservative i I'm not inany way close to being a Republican II'm pro-choice I'm Pro welfare I'm Prolegal immigration I I just also happento be Pro First Amendment and I am abeliever in the Second Amendment I thinkeveryone should have the right to defendthemselves protect themselves especiallyas a woman I have a right to walk downthe street and even the playing fieldby arming myself apparently those kindof ideas nowadays will get you labeled aracist they'll get you labeled a Nazithey'll get you labeled a bigot whenreally the war the war because we're sowe're so worked up and tuned up rightnowbut the real battle I think should beagainst the bigotry of low expectationsthat is permeating every culture in thisin this country you know the real issueis that we have a news media thatanswers to corporate sponsors not toactually conveying real news and sadlythe majority of Americans are gettingtheir news from those sources somehow inthe last year advocating for freedom ofthought has become a radical notion andI am sorry to anyone who I tuned out inthe past I am sorry to everyone like mewho's getting shunned who's gettinginsulted by friends by familyjust because you want to be able tothink for yourself and you want to beable to advocate that everyone should bethinking for themselves what's going onis a real shameI have been following the walk awaymovement and I couldn't stay silent Ihave to add my voice I've been sofrightened to speak out over the lastyear and this movement has made merealize how important it is to make surethat my voice is heard and that my voiceis added to the what is it now a millionpeople

I feel horriblethat I acted that way towards somepeople that had been friends of mine fora long timeand if if you're watching this and youwant to continue that conversation my myears are open now and a big part of thatinitial opening that that blindfoldcoming down was actually seeing theresponse to my LOI innopolis appearanceat Berkeley in February of 2017 I'm sureyou guys remember the footage youremember people going absolutely insanebreaking windows throwing I think oneone guy was throwing a podium orsomething I don't know people were goingcrazy and I thought oh my god that thisguy must be the Nazi that that everyonesays he is for them to act this way andI actually made the mistake of lookinginto what he was actually saying ofcourse I don't agree with everything hesays I don't think any of us agree witheverything that Milo says but I'd betotally remiss if I didn't thank him forthat initial i opening that initialblindfold slippage seeing how some of myleft friends were reacting to a youngman showing up at a college wanting tospeak it went against every ideal i heldas an american as a staunch defender ofthe Constitution freedom of speech isincredibly important to me I'm an actorI am an artist I am a writer if I didn'thave my First Amendment right I wouldn'thave any of the things that bring me joyin life to see people that I thoughtwere reasonable actually advocating thatother people should have their freedomof speechlimited because we don't agree with themthat is the most insane scary concept Ican't even I can't even fathom thatthere are people I call friends thatbelieve that and it was those samefriends that then sort of contributed tofurther pushing me away starting to tryto talk about this starting to try totalk about the things I was seeing toexpress concern about people that wereadvocating for the limiting of ourrights for the limiting of ourconstitutional rights it it it blows mymind to think about it and to havefriends call you a racist call yousexist call you an anti-feminist becauseyou believe that everyone should betreated equally all it does is justfurther alienate me and alienate therest of us and push us towards oneanother and inspire this movement thatwe need to talk about the worst of itfor me was a couple weeks ago when Istarted talking about border control andimmigration I don't see how wanting astrong working immigration policy iswrong I don't see how that makes me abigotbut I was talking to my mother about itthe other week andand she turned and looked at meand made a derogatory comment about mywhiteness she is Hispanic I am mixedI've been made fun of my whole life forbeing mixed for never fitting in withthe white people never fitting in withthe brown people being told by one halfthat I'm too dark being told by theother half I'm too light I've neverreally felt a part of any kind of racialidentity maybe that's why I reallyidentify as being an American being anAmerican is something that surpassescolor it surpasses creed it it evensurpasses country of origin this is anamazing country and I love being anAmerican and I love anyone who holdsAmerican ideals up so highly that theywould be willing to leave their homecountry to come here I I'm so for thatI'm so all about that and to have my ownmother turn and look at me and use myrace as an insult I don't think any anyany mother should do that I don't thinkanyone who really loves you and caresabout you should do that and that waswhy I decided to add my voice to thismovement because I am very scared tospeak up and talk about how I feelI i'm not even conservative i I'm not inany way close to being a Republican II'm pro-choice I'm Pro welfare I'm Prolegal immigration I I just also happento be Pro First Amendment and I am abeliever in the Second Amendment I thinkeveryone should have the right to defendthemselves protect themselves especiallyas a woman I have a right to walk downthe street and even the playing fieldby arming myself apparently those kindof ideas nowadays will get you labeled aracist they'll get you labeled a Nazithey'll get you labeled a bigot whenreally the war the war because we're sowe're so worked up and tuned up rightnowbut the real battle I think should beagainst the bigotry of low expectationsthat is permeating every culture in thisin this country you know the real issueis that we have a news media thatanswers to corporate sponsors not toactually conveying real news and sadlythe majority of Americans are gettingtheir news from those sources somehow inthe last year advocating for freedom ofthought has become a radical notion andI am sorry to anyone who I tuned out inthe past I am sorry to everyone like mewho's getting shunned who's gettinginsulted by friends by familyjust because you want to be able tothink for yourself and you want to beable to advocate that everyone should bethinking for themselves what's going onis a real shame
hey everybody Benji Irby here I ran intoBrandon Stryker yesterday and he askedme whether I'd ever done a walkawayvideo and I thought about it and I waslike no I actually haven'tso I'm gonna give you guys my walkawaystory it starts back in the early 2016I found myself homeless I had to give upmy apartment and I was living in my carduring that time I met this guy and wehad begun to date he was a littleyounger than me he was doing really wellfrom his himself had a really niceapartment um you know dog he was youknow really just doing it here in thecity and as we you know went on to dateand and went on and got closer Ieventually ended up moving in with himshortly after I moved in with him heconfided in me that he was an illegalimmigrant from Mexico and that him andhis family had come over the border whenhe was five and that he had you knowthey lived in Northern California theywere you know doing you know fruitpicking and things like that likeagricultural work and he was eventelling about how his brother had beendeported and they brought him back threetimes they raised the money to bring himback and he would just tell me differentstories about how the law enforcement inCalifornia are going with you knowillegal immigrants things like that wasjust very Lex and it's time went on andwe kept on going kept on dating and wegot to that summer I'll never forget itactually July 2nd 2016 we were having anargument and I was just feeling that thewhole world was against me the whole youknow the whole Loki thing of you knowthe white man trying to bring me downand the police and the system and allthis stuff that I just felt like wasjust you know against me as a blackperson America and he looked at me inthe midst of the argument we were in thecar and he said to me well you know mystory you know how you know I got hereyou know when I was five came up with aborder you know how I have you know fakesocial security number went to collegebuilt my life did everything I had to doyou knowof what circumstances I had to deal withso what's a black people's excuse and inthat moment I you know my first thoughtwas to be angry but then I thought youknow what he's absolutely right likewhat is black people's excuse whathow can people come here who've justgotten here and came with like athird-grade education and the clothes ontheir back not even supposed to be herelegally and I'm doing better then youknow someone like me and many otherslike me who are you know Black Americandescendants of slaves the people whohave been here for generations forhundreds and hundreds of yearshow can how can people be coming overthe border you know yesterday and bedoing better than us in like less than ageneration so it really caused me tothink of my politics what I was votingfor who I was voting for what I was atwhat I was supporting and just lookinginto what is it that they see in Americathat I don't see they see a land ofopportunity but I see a land ofoppression where these thoughts comefrom who's teaching us this how am Ifeeling this way and I just began tolook into everything I've been to lookinto how I voted who I supported in thepast I took the time to actually look upyou know what is the Democrat what isRepublican because most of us to behonest II really don't know we reallydon't pay attention we kind of just gowith you know go with the flow you knowthis guy's racist this guy's not racisthe's for the blacks he's not for theblacks whatever in this is kind of whatwe've always done but in looking inhistory and looking you know how thisimmigration thing has happened wherehave the jobs gone and what's happenedto our country even over the type offruitfulness that I felt you know evengrowing up as a kid in the in the in thelate eighties early 90s you know I didnot feel as though things with this badthings were not this bad for my parentsI mean I was raised you know intraditional household with you knowmarried parents who were still togetherand my father worked one job and he wasable to you know support everyone youknow I what happened to us so in lookingand looking deeper I realized that youknow wow I'm really a conservative Ididn't realize that I was a you knowconsume more conservativebut I really really am when you look atyou know what I thought about my countrywhat I think about you know a lot ofthese policies when I think aboutabortion and a lot of these other hotbutton social issues as well um andthat's what I decided I went from votingfor Bernie in the primary and I jumpedon the Trump train I voted for him inthe general and I've been ever since andI must say since I have been on thisside you know yes there's gonna thereare people who I you know knew from backin the day who are angry with me anddon't want to talk to him whatever and

empowered and opening withmy life in my life has done a total 180from that time and I've been buildingand I'm still building and I'm happy andI'm hopeful and I don't think thatthere's some great white boogeyman whowas out to get me every day and it'snice to be able to say I lean on myselfand I build myself and I've taken myselffrom homelessness to having a home andowning a business and just doing muchbetter for myself and going out now andyou know doing the little you know TVstuff that I do ongoing and talkingabout conservatism and just how it hasjust changed my life and it's changingthe lives of so many people around me sofor those who may feel as though theycan't you know walk away or you know arescared of walking away because of whatpeople are gonna say and what peoplethinkforget about them I mean there's so manynew people there's so much openness andlove on the other side and even moresothan that you've got to do what you haveto do for you and yourself financiallythis country is being run down byillegal immigration and for black menlike me who don't have a college degreethese are this is like ID number onecompetition and I'm seeing slowly butsurely the black people starting to seethat and it's not a one-sided thingbecause yes the Democrats want them forthe cheap votes but many of ourRepublicans outside of our lovelypresident Uncle Don presidentthey want them for the sheep laborso it's an honest thought on both sidesis up to us an American patriots tostand together against the scourge ofillegal immigration because nothingagainst my ex-boyfriend nothing againsthis

takethat first step today
hello hello hello how you doinguh i am christopher wrightand i'm going to explain to you why ichose to walk away from the democraticpartyand go into conservatism sowhat better way to explain than whileyou're walking awayi'm walking away from work right now sothat's justyou know coincidence but this uh is whatit isand i live in the brooklyn new york cityareayou know very blue state grew up arounda blue state too in maryland sobeen around blue almost my life uhsomething a little backgrounduh when uh my dad was militaryex-military now he's retired army majorum infantry and sohe's currently in the military but we iwe moved around quite a bit when i wasyounger as a military brati lived in germany for five years uhwhere we stationed in bombholder andmanheim two military bases over therespent five years over there sold aberlin wall fall one of my earliestmemories in life is watching the berlinwall fallseeing freedom freedom is one of theearliest memories of lifefreedom another country but yet freedomyou know seeing families get togetherfor the first time indecades so that's one of those memoriesi have in life is seeing the berlin wallfall so i got pieces from the wall homeand all that good stuff but uh soanyways i always had love from america ialways had love for the country i looki'm looking around a bit because i'mwalking through the cities across thestreets and stuff so that's why i'mlooking aroundyou see it but i always had love for thecountry always hello from america wecame to the states in 91been here grew up in maryland most of mylife moved around from there georgiaflorida and i'm in new york cityand uh i've been voting democrats sincei'vesince i've been 18. my mom's a democratmy grandparents aunts uncles everybodycan think of and familyall democrats so what made me decideto go conservative i think it wasi went and supported obama of course icampaigned for him and 08went door-to-door for the man got himquite a few votes and i was down ingeorgiaso you know i always had that uhpoliticalway of thinking so i always beenpolitically mind-statea political mind but when i i waslooking at thiscurrent situation i was looking at 1016electioni was i was iffy because even if 2012i was already looking at obama like hedidn't keep a lot of his campaignpromises and you know he just uh seemedhe washis message was a lot different from hisactions when he was running the messagehe had when he was running compared towhathis uh way of governing were twodifferent things and i noticed thatso i was like okay i'm open-minded i'mgoing to look at another candidateand you know until the 12th there's acouple kids i was interested inbut like ron paul mainly but the mediadestroyed his opportunitybecause they stopped covering him whenhe was starting to lead in the primariesand after thathe fell off so i noticed the media'sstronghold a long time agoso in 2016 i still was open-minded isaid go either way and see who thecandidates arei saw dr ben carson running on therepublican primaryand i grew up with dr ben carson becausemy you know grouping sunday advancedchurch my dad same day venice stilli'm i believe in god but i don't followa direct religion at the momentum but anyways you know so he met drmccarson a couple timestold me all about the man how you knowthe first neurosurgeon toseparate siamese twins from the brain uhgave me his book gifted hands when i wasyoung with my first books i've readgood book amazing book helped me youknow shaped my life in a way in apositive wayshowing my dad showing me good positiveblack male figuresin society that weren't just athletes orrappers oryou know you just saw me you can besuccessful as a black man in americawithout necessarily just doing thestereotypical things that we see fromthe mediaso i had always had lots of dr bencarson and when he was running hedefinitely got my attention soi was all supportive him because to behonest i've never been a fan of hillaryclinton and i can goanother video about that but i can go onand on a million things what's wrongwith heryou know black better super predatorsthat don't really want to go there rightnow butanyways uh she was not a candidate i wasgoing to chooseso i just wanted to see what oppositionwas and if there was somebody i wouldvote for on the opposite side i wouldchoose them if not thenmaybe i would vote independent but wehad to see solike i said dr ben carson definitely gotmy attentionand only to get my attention but heactuallystarted leading at one point in therepublican primary and i was excitedabout thati was like wow you know he's fightingfor christians he's fighting fora lot of values moral values just youknow old-school conservative moralvalues he was fighting foryou know he wasn't a career politicianand when he started doing welli saw the media treat him differentlyand they were given a lot moretime on television but what they weredoing was getting interviews and theywere trying to trip him up withquestionsand get to the point where it's like ohsee you know he's a liarand they eventually got there with westpoint they misconstrued his wordswhen it came to west point and whathappened the situation with college withhim when he was youngerand they used that to pretty much saythe guy's a liar and to discredit himand it workedand he didn't really have the voice tofight back so once that happened itmessed up hispolitical chances and that was it forhim and i saw the media pretty much doitso when donald trump came around ofcourse you know how he treats the mediahe destroys them he's been dealing withthem his whole life obviously and hehandles it accordingly so he pretty muchsmacked up the mainstream media like heshould haveand because he did that you know we wereable toimprove as a country because of what hedidyou know talking about the mediaexposing the media because that was beenan issue with this country for a veryvery long timeand i'm glad he he was put it out thereand then i said all right let me hearwhat manchester say so i'll listen tosome of hisi was watching some of his rallies hearhis campaign speechesa lot of his message was what resonateswith me you knowi'm talking about the economy bringingjobs back border control border securityuh immigration the travel ban which i'vebeen watching was going on in europethat was very big for me with the travelban what he did thereso he just was talking a lot of things iwas like you know what this iswhat i'm about if you know if he'stelling the truth and you knowi don't care who you know about you knowevery little detail about the manhimselfif this is what he's running for andrunning with this stancehe's got my vote so i came out andsupported himand uh the moment i came out on socialmedia and said heyvoting for trump and i got everybodypissed offfamily friends oh my gosheverybody i'm talking about childhoodfriends i mean i grew maryland very bluestate maryland isso white black alike were very upsetwith me a lot of arguments a lot ofdebatesa lot of unfriending on their behalf notmine i haven't unfriended nobodyin real life or social media because ofpolitics but i've been unfriended inreal life social media by quite a few ofmy friends and familybecause of my political choices so i'mjust reallyhere to say that i'm glad i made thevote that i didi'm proud of what what my president

[Music]hi I'm Pauline Chilton I live in Iowaand this is my walk away videotestimonial I was born in South Korea Igrew up on the south side of Chicago I'mKorean and black my father is a Vietnamveteran and he was an engineer mygrandparents grew up in the south duringthe Great Depression and the Jim Crowera my godparents uncles aunts severaldifferent people in my life and aroundme showed me that there was more to lifethan the hoodI had many relatives who were propertyowners entrepreneurs just hard-workingindividuals my grandfather was a steelworker my great-grandfather was acarpenter and a sharecropper all ofthese people taught me the value ofeducation hard work individualresponsibility and spirituality theystressed to me that if you want anythingin life you have to work for it nobody'sgoing to give you anything or doanything for you for nothingsomehow I grew up believing thatDemocrats were the good guys and theRepublicans were the bad guys and Ididn't question it I didn't try tounderstand the differences between thetwo parties I just accepted thisthroughout most of my life although Iwitnessed firsthand how crime drugaddiction family breakdown jobdiscrimination high unemploymentunderfunded schools welfare dependencyhousing discrimination the lack ofinvestment in black neighborhoods youknow all these things completelydemoralize the black communityI saw how difficult it was for blackpeople to enter the middle class andstay in it and I still didn't questionwhether or not it was because ofdemocrat policies let me be clear I grewup on the south side of Chicago wheremost of the people there were black sowhen I talk about these things it's fromthat point of reference and I also wantto be clear about the fact that I know alot of Democrats who are good people andthey vote Democrat they believe they'reon the right side of history and I'm notattacking these individuals I stronglyfeel that and I'm saying this as aformer Democrat that we were misled yesthere were bad Republicans there aregood and bad people in everything in2015 I was finally fed up with thedirection our country was going in Idecided I needed to change how I wasvoting and I knew then that I was notgoing to vote for another Democrat forpresident I started researching theRepublican candidates I started to do adeeper dive and into learning about whatit means to be a Republican what itmeans to be a conservative and Irealized that I always had conservativebeliefs and values I found out about howyou know the Republican Party is youknow the party that can that supportsconservative values and you know there'salso some Democrats who haveconservative values and they just don'trealize it yet that they're reallyconservatives pro-business theRepublican Party is the party that wasanti-slavery they're the party that gotblack people citizenship they're theparty that got black people the right tovote they're the party that got womenthe right to vote and they were thefirst to elevate black people to equalpolitical powerand had a positive role in civil rightsand I'm not againnot just talking about black peopleRepublicans did these things for otheryou know groups and individualsthroughout history throughout societyand you know these were things that Ijust didn't know about before I startedto really look into itand just imagine that thatdisappointment that I felt you know thatwe're not being taught these things andso I had to go looking for it I had togo searching for it and and that's whenyou know I just you know you just havethose feelings of being you know why whywere these things hidden from us thosefeelings of being lied to and and so itjust didn't feel good I went to DonaldTrump's campaign rally in 2015 and itwas when he held his rally right here inDubuque Iowa I heard him speak in personand I listened when he clearly laid outhis plan for how he was going to leadthe country and I realized how unfairlythe media was treating Trump and I wentinto the Republican caucus in 2016 andchanged my party affiliation fromDemocrat to Republican I believe in theAmerican dream I believe that anyone canachieve anything that they put theirmind to and no matter where they camefrom or where they started out in life Ibelieve in equality of opportunity andthat is what it means to be a to be aRepublican to be a conservative and youknow and so since that you know thosethings that I believe in is what youknow what conservatives and Republicansare allthat's why I'm with them my name isPauline Chilton I'm a walk away and I'mproud of itthanks for watching

hi there I'm Roma I've been a Democratmy entire life and my parents wereDemocrats my grandparents for Democratswhen I was a little kid my grandfathersat me down and instructed me that I onbeing a Democrat and I was supposed tobe one for the rest of my life and I wassupposed to always vote for Democratsand I pretty much followed thatdirective and I went to schools inCalifornia went to college in Californiaof course it was a long time ago but itstill California was progressive thenand you know I've been around Californiamy entire life so I've been around a lotof progressive people it was never anissue I considered myself to be aprogressive to be left but the past fewyears it's just been harder and harderto reconcile myself with being on theLeft I've been hearing people say thingslike you know all white people areracist well you know whatcan't get much whiter than me and Idon't consider myself to be a racistand I hear people talk about being youknow homophobes and yeah I feared thisyou're a fascist if hear that you're aracist if you're that years.this and allthese things I keep hearing from myliberal leftist friends never heardthose from the people that I knew on theright oh my firm I looked at the liberalleftist friends so I've been sittingaround for awhile wondering what's goingon thinking is it just me and mine theonly one who's looking at all thesepeople or you know applauding into fehand saying yeah they're doing a greatthing it's like the only fascist aroundthe antifa people are the antifa peoplethey're the fascist everybody else isjusttrying to live a life and when I heardabout this walkaway movement it justsing to me it's like yes this is exactlywhat I've been thinking this is exactlywhat I've been trying to say to peoplewithout having people jump down mythroat because I'm disagreeing with youknow going against and going against thebelief system but you know what I'mgoing against the belief system becausepolitics is not religion you know I'm aChristian and I believe in God but Ialso believe intrigued and I believe intreating people fairly now I also but Ido believe in treating people fairly andI believe in giving people a chance andI believe that you can't judge people bythe color of their skin but by theinstead you judge them by the content oftheir character and just because aperson votes for Trump does not makethem a fascist it does not make them aracist does not make them a homophobe itjust makes him a person who voted forTrump so I am so glad that there is awalkaway movement and I am so happy tocount myself amongst them because thisgirl this old lady has walked awaythanks good luck everybody
if you'd asked meuh if you would have asked me 10 yearsagothat i would be making this video todayand we'd be having this conversationi would tell you hell no there's no wayyou're out of your mindum but here we aremany years later and uhthis is my walk away story andi walked away from the democratic partyat the end towards the end of barackobama'sfinal term in office obviouslyobama supporter and voter umdedicated democratbut i was disappointed both timesand a really weird thing happened duringthe obama presidencymy eyes were open tothe media and how they manipulatefact to supporteither a liberal president democraticpresident ora liberal or democratic candidatei didn't know that i didn't see itbecause of coursethe media told me what i wanted to hearfor years they were saying thatbut a funny thing happened i moved to elpaso texasum in 2000 umi was there in 2007 and uhi lived there for a little while and uhi was there at around the time that thedrug warbetween the cartels warfare territorygot really really bad and uhgot deadly and got just brutali mean people were getting slaughteredevery day every day there was a murderevery day either an innocent personwould get murderedsomeone who worked with the cartel wouldget murderedpublic officials would get murdered iftheir families would get murderedi mean it was it was brutal it was justprobably one of the worst things thati've ever seen and been anywhere nearbecause this happened in juarez which isright over the borderin fact if i went to my balcony in thetown house if i went to the balcony inthe place that i was staying inand uh it would it was you know welived in the park on the west side of elpaso real nice neighborhoodsum but it was we lived in the part whereyou could overlookmexico you could see juanes and you canseei mean a good part of the city from fromthe vantage point that i hadand what me and my my buddies would dowe wouldwe would drink beers and sit on sit onthe balconyand around 11 o'clock 12 o'clock atnight sure enoughyou would see rapid machine gun fireum going across the skies you know atfar off in the distance at what embodiesevery morning you wake up and you seestories ofpeople getting killed tortured beheadedhungi mean all these things are donepublicly all these things are donethe bodies weren't being hidden theywere very much exposed messageswere being set i mean they would havebodies on bridges hanging from bridgeswith the messageum you know um they would they wouldassassinate public officials and theirfamilies i mean it was just the worstthing that i've everi had ever seen up until that point inmy lifeand the thing that really stood out tomewas that of course we had the mexicanmedia you know we got the mexican peoplepaperuh from juarez called el diario eldiariobut the american mediacompletely ignored this completelyignored what was going onyou would rarely hear a reportyou know um i remember the month of mayin 2008 i believe 2007being one of the most violent months inhistory inin the city where uh you knowi think it was like 2700 people weremassacredand nothing nothing from the newsnothing from the american media it wasjust an afterthought ifeven a thought and i always wonderedabout that i would have friendsbecause we used to you know i'm from newmexiconew mexico not old mexico but new mexicohere in the us and uh we used to go totexas and we used to go to el paso orlas cruces andcross the border and go to bars and goparty because everything was cheap orwe'd go shoppingand uh couldn't do that anymore but theni would have kidsfriends come from other cities come fromcome to visit me and they didn't haveaccess to the mexican papersand they think hey we're going to go tomexico tonight and party and i wouldtell them you're crazy don'tyou know there it's martial law themilitary is out they have a strictcurfewand if you're out caught past curfeweither the police are gonna get youthe cartels are gonna get you or themilitary's gonna get youif you go out there once something'sgonna get you they had no clueand i didn't understand that until iheard aboutthe barack obama the obamaadministration'sfailed uh gunrunning um investigationfast and furious where they gavethey allow um militarygrade weapons to cross into the borderinto mexicointo the hands of cartels to supposedlytrack downwho's buying the weapons now this wasthe dumbest thing i've ever heardit was the dumbest excuse that i everheard and it was clear to meat that time that the reason they cameup with that excuse is because they gotcaughtthey were actually selling guns to thecartels they were actuallyfunding this war andseeing i mean there was one event whenthe cartel death squads went into a townand they just knocked on doors andliterallyjust massacred people massacred familiesthat lived there just brutally killedpeoplenothing nothing in the news about it nota peaknothing and i realized from that thatthe newswas protecting barack obama'spresidency they were protecting themfrom the truthof what they had done they wereprotecting them from peoplefinding out that they were selling gunsto the cartels and these guns werekilling massive creating massacring i'msorry i can't say that right it's so badbut they were massacring thousandstens of thousands of innocent mexicancitizensfamilies men women childrenelderly didn't matter still doesn'tmatter they're still doing itbut the media covered up for it it wasat that point that i realizedthat i was i was going fora party that was fake i was going for aparty that hada hidden agenda a hidden secret agendahidden government that people didn'tknow aboutand the media covered it up umit was from there i started opening myeyes were open and i started tonotice this the way stories were beingtoldthe way things and words were beingmanipulatedto not blatantly lie about a story butto suggest a differentidea of the truth you know and um it wasreally it

about how Trumpwas going to take away our rights if hewon and how Hillary was the only answerI have never been a fan of Hillary or asupporter of hers I was always more onthe side of Bernie but when he allowedthe two women to take over his rally Ibegan to doubt him greatly and afterwhat the DNC did to him and he didn'tfight it and instead of trying to fightit he threw his support behind Hillarythat was the following nail in thecoffin for meI had no one I wanted to but for no oneI wanted to sport it was also duringthis time in which I started to see howtoxic the left was becoming because theywould say things like oh if you don'tsupport Hillary or sexist you're a bigotwhy would you support Trump because he'sracist and sexist and a bigot andeverything umI never I looked for the claims

hi I'm so scaredabout what this world is coming to likeI'm one of those quiet independentpeople when it comes to politics where Ijust observe and I don't say nothing butit's come to the point where when yousee bullcrap happening everywhere you goand you see and you hear people justspooling lies that the media pitches topeople brainwashing people that gets tothe point where you get tired of it youget really tired of it and you startjust thinking about stuff like why wouldyou listen to the TV when the TV iscontrolled by high people up there thatwanna brainwash you in order to keep youpolitically closed in the shell of abubble so that you won't know what'sreally going on in our country whatreally is happening here they wannadivide us as people saying that blacksare blacks why are white Latinos areLatinos immigrants are immigrantsAmericans are Americans so that we won'treally see the problemand when you say something that peopledon't like they automatically call youracism that's fascist in and of itselfwhen you call somebody racist justbecause you don't like what they'resaying you're taking away their freedomof speech the constitutional rights thatour founding fathers gave to us I'll ownno gun I will never own again the onlyreason why I would never own a gun isbecause I haven't a serious mentalillness that I'm working on so a gun isnot feasible to me but you know thatcomes with consequences that I'm notallowed to own a gun do you know butthere's a lot of people who can own agun there are that are not mentally illand I feel really bad for them becausewhen you say you're gonna take awaypeople's Second Amendment just becausesomebody uses a gun to kill people noguns don't kill people people peoplekill peopleit don't really matter if you grab ifyou take away people's guns or knivesand all that people's gonna always finda way to kill people evil people areevil people you could take away gunswhat's gonna happen if the black marketis gonna soar in sales when you takeaway guns because that's even worse fora country when you register when youcan't register a gun you don't know whohas guns you're taking away people'sright to register guns and taking awaytheir guns so that means people is gonnabuy guns in the black market they'regonna get it from these cartels they'regonna gain more power and you know whatthink about it they taken away yourSecond Amendment so that you coulddepend on the government to protect youI don't know about you but I grew up inthe ghetto Philly and when someone shootup your house the police don't get thereuntil two hours

dat'll they're not gonna comestraightaway look how long it took themto get to El Paso just in one minutethat person killed all those people whybecause they couldn't bear arms and youknow in Texas people have the rightthat's one of those countries thatbelieve 100% that you could protectyourself and look because these peopledepending on the police to protect thema lot of them died and then they wantedtopoint fingers saying that it was the gunthat did it it was the president who diditit was democracy who did it was racingwho didn't know no it wasn'tcome on be logical right here let's sayI don't agree with a lot of policiesthat happen nowadays but am I gonna graba gun and shoot people cause of it noI'm not people who shoot and her peopleare people who intentionally do it theydo it because they wanna do it they doit because they bad they evil they wannahurt people they're gonna hurt youwhether they have a political view ornot ain't nobody's fault if you grab aknife and stab someone that's nobody'sfault that's your fault you gotta paythe consequences for that it really likebother me or not I always think quietbut I can't believe all this stuffthat's happening you want to

whenthey started embracingsocialism instead of capitalism insteadof independence they started listeningto the government saying oh free thisfree that free this free that look atthem now they don't they one of thepoorest countries in Central Americathe poorest country in Central Americaand that's what they trying to make usdo they try to make us and ruin everysingle little value that we put up thatwe fought for for the last 300 years alot of people be making me mad when theybe saying oh this land wasn't ours inthe first placewe came over here and we killed theIndians and we robbed this and that andthat let me tell you something whenChristopher Columbus migrated over herehe was called a seller a colonial wherehe tried to make peace with the Indiansand the Indians being lovingkind-hearted people they acceptedColonials it was the French and theEnglish and I forgot your nose like Isaid I ain't perfect that came here andwanted to destroy the colonial basedAmericans that wanted to escape fromfrom religious communism they escapedall these countries because they wantedto come here and be able to have freedomof speech in freedom of religion that'swhy they came over here it was theFrench and the English who startedfighting for America because they wantedto have the oil have the gold theywanted to push their political agendason the colonists and the Indians andpeople don't realize that the colonistswere the true Americans that werefighting the French and the English andit was the colonists that won it wasthat flag that they put up that one itwas it the French and the English thatone it was the colonists that runs onethat was the true Americanthat's where the founding fathers camefrom was from the colonists thatcolonized America they colonized it itwas the French and the English that waskilling the Indians not the coloniststhe French and the English was killingthe Indians and the colonists but peopledon't study the past history they wantto spew things that they don'tunderstand instead of them looking forinformation themselves it's reallysimplewe was founded in 1776 that was waybefore founding fathers got here 1776search it up oh no oh no I don't knowwhat to make about 2020 but if the mediakeep going with this pointing fingertype of crap we is on the brink of CivilWardo you know what civil war is that'swhat that's when people your own peoplefight against

hi everyone my name is Chris HumphriesI'm a 54 year old man yeah I'm from UtahMormon boy born and raised here graduateof Brigham Young University I probablyam the poster child of white privilegehi I was born to the last of seven kidsto a dentist that was pretty wealthy andof course being the last kid and wealthyI tended to get you know a lot ofbenefits and and and and you knowalthough I don't apologize I am gratefulfor what I was I was given and I wouldprobably put me on a poster and handhave chance against me with if they knewme but like I said I make no apologiesof it I'm very grateful for my upcomingI was born to a man by the name of dr.Roy Humphries and he was a wonderful manand this is a guy that taught me hebought a farm just so he could teach hiskids how to work and and although he waswealthy and we were raised you knowpretty well-off he wanted us to learnhow to work on a farm so we knew how todo what we did and he used to give us itwas like a couple hundred yards long andhe'd give us a roll that we had to weedand every every day he'd say you can'tdo anything till that row is finishedand he had make us pull weeds all theway along this 200 yard you know 150yard row of corn or whatever it was thatwe were raising at that time and we hadto pull every weed and he'd go outinspect and if it wasn't done he'd saygo finish your row and don't come backuntil it's done finish your damn row andhe was a tough man that he was a goodman he taught me how to work hard and at8:18 he cut the apron string and saidyou're on your own and he didn't pay formy college I paid every cent of ithe didn't didn't buy me a car I bought a15 year old Datsun 310 the vapor lockedduring the summer like every dayhorrible and and he'd pay for my weddingme and my wife had to come up with themoney and we had a very modest weddingand you know my wife Melanie's fromCanada she was lucky enough to they weredown here visiting and his her mom whenit was pregnant and ended up going intolabor with her while she was visitingdown here and and that's how she becamea dual citizen of America and andalthough she grew up in Canada she camehere to school we met and because thatthe circumstance was right we were ableto she she took on the role of insteadof being a dual citizen being UnitedStates solely citizen and we've beenever grateful for that but we we livedon nothing we didn't have a microphonewe started nobody gave us anything westarted very humble and my first job Ithink I got a job out of college after Ifinished I was $50,000 in debt I had acredit card they had $1,200 worth of ofyou know available cash on it and $36and I got a job in Vancouver Washingtonand we threw everything in our 20 yearold truck and we drove - he had onechild at that time a two-year-old childand we drove to Washington and we tookall 12 hundred dollars out in the cashadvance and doing that in the thirty-sixdollarswe cut our first apartment in a reallyrough area but that was our beginningsand from there we worked our cans off toget where we out we're at and I'mgrateful for that experience because itmakes so sweet the experience we havenow and what we have I've been aconservative and Republican my wholelife and I don't apologize for that Ilike being that but I think technicallyI'm still a Republican and Ifiguratively walked away about two yearsagoI think I'm still on the rolls I likehaving that because I you know ifthere's something up close primary goingonI like to be able to devote for you knowthe one I like but I consider myself anindependent conservative vote Democraticevery once in a while and honestly myview is that the founding fathers werethey were inspired I believe they wereGod driven to come up with this landwhat they came up with it was nothingshort of brilliant and the more Ilearned about it and I think they builta system that would have Republican andDemocrat it would always check eachother and that when the pendulum wouldswing one way the other party would pullthem back and it's usually the peoplethat pulls them back right because whenthey get sick of one party becausethey're going too far in craziness theyswitch over and join the other party andthat's what's going on now with us rightwe're going to the other side becausewe've had enough of the pendulum goingtoo farand just as well as it could go one wayif the Republican Party could go theother and become start doing stupidstuff but I decided about two years agoto figuratively leave the RepublicanParty to walk away basically and thereason why is Mitt Romney disturbed methis was the man I campaigned for Ibelong to the same religion he does Icampaigned for him thought for him gavehim lots of money and I watched Iwatched Donald Trump endorse him givehim millions of dollars write checks tohim I watched Mitt Romney write socialmedia on Facebook you know little blurbsabout how great Donald Trump was and hiswisdom and business and etc and whatreally disturbed me is that when DonaldTrump decided to run MIT Romney afterall the things that Donald Trump haddone to him stab you in the back reallybought me I I lost sleep over it I wroteletter after letter till he met what afake you us and he was a fake and thethings he said were wrong they weren'tjust differencesI understand differences I respectdifferences I really doin fact I respect the argument out thereI think it keeps all of us in check theargument back and forthI think our founding fathers basicallybuilt an argument of debate but thatdebate constantly keeps us centered andif we go one way we were pulled back tothe other end and I love it I think it'sthe great that that's why we have thecountry we have is because the freedomto think different and to fight for ourthoughts that back to Mitt Romney Iwatched after Donald Trump had did somuch for him in the words that mittcalled him as a brilliant businessmanthen when Donald [ __ ] around MittRomney went after him he is famousUniversity of Utah speech where hestabbed Donald Trump so bad in the backhe called him a racist misogynist hecalled him every name in the book hewent after him and did the exact sameevil tactics the left and the media didto him a couple years earlier and it wasso disheartening you know bothered mekept me up at night because this is aguy I idolized a guy I thought wasperfect the guy I thought would havebeen the greatest president ever towatch him stab someone else in the backthe way he did it wasn't justdifferencesit was vindictive he was horrible and Irealized that I decided then that allpoliticians are evil I decided that backin Washington corrupts everyone it'stoxic poison poisons everything backthere in that Beltway and Mitt Romney Ibecame no fan of his and I thought he tome I thought he was you know silver tosnake and but I just did a lot ofthinking at that point and decided thatI'm not gonna be hold to any party thatI consider myself a independent thinkingconservative and I'd vote on what Ithink is bestand most of the time don't get me wrongit's it's on the Republican side ninetyninety-five percent of the time but oncein a while I see a good Democrat I see agood libertarian I see someone that youknow a good good conservative Democrator a good Blue Dog Democrats justfighting for a good cause and I don'tmind you swinging the lever on that sideas well and so that's kind of my storywhy I walked away I love this countryyou know I I watched you know it took mea long time to warm up to Donald Trump Iwas a Ted Cruz guy from the beginningand for nine months I watched him and Igot more and more curious where Iwatched every single rally he had andI'd watched these crazy rallies Iscratch my head and wonder how the heckto some would get that many people outand I still like Ted Cruz and but Iwould watch him and little by littlelike realized and as I watched him Ibegan to figure out what real is theWashington wasn't real that thepoliticians back there are just they'renot real they're fake they're peacocksyou know what a peacock is rightpeacocks a beautiful bird beautiful birdI was raised right by him I had aneighbor that had peacocks they'rebeautiful birds and they strut aroundand show their feathers but at the endof the day you know what they are youpluck the feathers out them they're noteven good to eat they're just squawkingbirds to [ __ ] and do nothing for nobodyfor peacocks and I realize thatpoliticians are like peacocks you strutaround they don't really do anything andI shouldn't be so generalized becausethere is some really good people outthere but I got very bitter when Iwatched Mitt Romneyanyway I'm going sideways aren't I Ilove this movement I love you allI think it's the craziest thing I'veever seensome of the nutty people on in dudetapes oh the transvestite man thatundressed his face in front of everyoneI mean I'm telling you that was crazygood golly uh he started talking and Iwas kind of intrigued with what he wassaying and then when he pulled off hisfirst I'll add I don't think I heard aword he said from that point on all Iwas was intrigued of what he couldlisten to I'll tell you what I like theguy man I don't say this to a lot ofpeople but that'd be one guy put on myboat and take him fishing he's real hewanted to show us with who he was and hewas real and I like that I like alls cuzI think we are the real deal I thinkwe're the ones that make this countrywork were the real deal you know andit's little only sometimes at the topyou know I raised a boy that was anall-state wrestler and you went tocollege on a scholarship you stillalways tell him he'd say dad so lonelycuz you know and everyone else isgoofing off and boating and doingwhatever he's gonna work out ribtraining he tell me how lonely it wasand then when he want to statechampionship he said guess what goesstraight lonely at the top of thatpodium but I liked it a lotand I think that's a little like usright now we're a little lonely but Ibut I like this lonely I like it a lot Ilike being independent and I like beingright and I don't care if the wholeworld's against me if I know I'm rightI'm right right and I know we're rightThank You

theway along this 200 yard you know 150yard row of corn or whatever it was thatwe were raising at that time and we hadto pull every weed and he'd go outinspect and if it wasn't done he'd saygo finish your row and don't come backuntil it's done finish your damn row andhe was a tough man that he was a goodman he taught me how to work hard and at8:18 he cut the apron string and saidyou're on your own and he didn't pay formy college I paid every cent of ithe didn't didn't buy me a car I bought a15 year old Datsun 310 the vapor lockedduring the summer like every dayhorrible and and he'd pay for my weddingme and my wife had to come up with themoney and we had a very modest weddingand you know my wife Melanie's fromCanada she was lucky enough to they weredown here visiting and his her mom whenit was pregnant and ended up going intolabor with her while she was visitingdown here and and that's how she becamea dual citizen of America and andalthough she grew up in Canada she camehere to school we met and because thatthe circumstance was right we were ableto she she took on the role of insteadof being a dual citizen being UnitedStates solely citizen and we've beenever grateful for that but we we livedon nothing we didn't have a microphonewe started nobody gave us anything westarted very humble and my first job Ithink I got a job out of college after Ifinished I was $50,000 in debt I had acredit card they had $1,200 worth of ofyou know available cash on it and $36and I got a job in Vancouver Washingtonand we threw everything in our 20 yearold truck and we drove - he had onechild at that time a two-year-old childand we drove to Washington and we tookall 12 hundred dollars out in the cashadvance and doing that in the thirty-sixdollarswe cut our first apartment in a reallyrough area but that was our beginningsand from there we worked our cans off toget where we out we're at and I'mgrateful for that experience because itmakes so sweet the experience we havenow and what we have I've been aconservative and Republican my wholelife and I don't apologize for that Ilike being that but I think technicallyI'm still a Republican and Ifiguratively walked away about two yearsagoI think I'm still on the rolls I likehaving that because I you know ifthere's something up close primary goingonI like to be able to devote for you knowthe one I like but I consider myself anindependent conservative vote Democraticevery once in a while and honestly myview is that the founding fathers werethey were inspired I believe they wereGod driven to come up with this landwhat they came up with it was nothingshort of brilliant and the more Ilearned about it and I think they builta system that would have Republican andDemocrat it would always check eachother and that when the pendulum wouldswing one way the other party would pullthem back and it's usually the peoplethat pulls them back right because whenthey get sick of one party becausethey're going too far in craziness theyswitch over and join the other party andthat's what's going on now with us rightwe're going to the other side becausewe've had enough of the pendulum goingtoo farand just as well as it could go one wayif the Republican Party could go theother and become start doing stupidstuff but I decided about two years agoto figuratively leave the RepublicanParty to walk away basically and thereason why is Mitt Romney disturbed methis was the man I campaigned for Ibelong to the same religion he does Icampaigned for him thought for him gavehim lots of money and I watched Iwatched Donald Trump endorse him givehim millions of dollars write checks tohim I watched Mitt Romney write socialmedia on Facebook you know little blurbsabout how great Donald Trump was and hiswisdom and business and etc and whatreally disturbed me is that when DonaldTrump decided to run MIT Romney afterall the things that Donald Trump haddone to him stab you in the back reallybought me I I lost sleep over it I wroteletter after letter till he met what afake you us and he was a fake and thethings he said were wrong they weren'tjust differencesI understand differences I respectdifferences I really doin fact I respect the argument out thereI think it keeps all of us in check theargument back and forthI think our founding fathers basicallybuilt an argument of debate but thatdebate constantly keeps us centered andif we go one way we were pulled back tothe other end and I love it I think it'sthe great that that's why we have thecountry we have is because the freedomto think different and to fight for ourthoughts that back to Mitt Romney Iwatched after Donald Trump had did somuch for him in the words that mittcalled him as a brilliant businessmanthen when Donald [ __ ] around MittRomney went after him he is famousUniversity of Utah speech where hestabbed Donald Trump so bad in the backhe called him a racist misogynist hecalled him every name in the book hewent after him and did the exact sameevil tactics the left and the media didto him a couple years earlier and it wasso disheartening you know bothered mekept me up at night because this is aguy I idolized a guy I thought wasperfect the guy I thought would havebeen the greatest president ever towatch him stab someone else in the backthe way he did it wasn't justdifferencesit was vindictive he was horrible and Irealized that I decided then that allpoliticians are evil I decided that backin Washington corrupts everyone it'stoxic poison poisons everything backthere in that Beltway and Mitt Romney Ibecame no fan of his and I thought he tome I thought he was you know silver tosnake and but I just did a lot ofthinking at that point and decided thatI'm not gonna be hold to any party thatI consider myself a independent thinkingconservative and I'd vote on what Ithink is bestand most of the time don't get me wrongit's it's on the Republican side ninetyninety-five percent of the time but oncein a while I see a good Democrat I see agood libertarian I see someone that youknow a good good conservative Democrator a good Blue Dog Democrats justfighting for a good cause and I don'tmind you swinging the lever on that sideas well and so that's kind of my storywhy I walked away I love this countryyou know I I watched you know it took mea long time to warm up to Donald Trump Iwas a Ted Cruz guy from the beginningand for nine months I watched him and Igot more and more curious where Iwatched every single rally he had andI'd watched these crazy rallies Iscratch my head and wonder how the heckto some would get that many people outand

hi Brandon I'm doing this because you'reasking I'm not Russian but I'm anAmerican it has been I've been living inFrance for the last thirty years thelast time I voted in an election beforethis past one was um a bit of Dukakiswhich was very funny because nobodyseems to know who that was I was incollege at the time University of Texasat Austin I was very active there was alot of things going on about apartheidand I was in the school of architectureI believed that we all are I believethat we all are equal I I don't I don'tunderstand how I went from beingconsidered open-minded and liberal andunderstanding and I went to his schoolthat when I went there it was reallyfunny because um at the time in the 80sit UT um I was one in 20 women there wasan architectural school and um half themen did okay the people that were therewere gay and they were people like youand me um all of my friends were veryopen and honest and we could talk aboutthings yeah they're the people that arehomophobes they're people that areracist but the thing is is that when youactually talked to people and theyrealized that you're a real person thatthey that there was a possibility fordiscussion when I came to France likeyou know I guess that was in the early90s all of my friends were differentevery single one of them was differentthey were all from different places anddifferent cultures and strangely enoughwhat made itdifferent made us really close thatbrought us together we were able to talkabout itover the past I don't know that wasasleep I guess I didn't realize that theworld was changing and I've never beenpolitically active and I just you knowthe government sort of let us do ourthing and I really believe that majorityof people actually have like commonsense and they're good and we can allsort of stray off paths and things likethat um there was a reason why I bet inthe last election that has cost me anumber of friends and that has kasniayeah well it's funny how I went frombeing too open-minded and tounderstanding and to helpful and tounderstanding other people to beingincredibly rejected by a number ofpeople that I really care for and well Ijust I can't handle this hate anymoreand I don't understand it and is it isis being an architect and working andstuff like this like oh you can't havethis opinion you can't do this and soyeah I've kept my mouth shutI've kept my mouth shut for a very longtimeum and I do I would hope that I wasdoing work that actually improvedpeople's lives make things better forother people and I would really hopethat other people were understandingabout that but this virtue signaling andthrowing out hatred is just notbelievable to me so I you know there'slove everybody campaign andthere's you know a lot of things to tryto make the world a better place which Ialways thought that that's kind of theimportant thing that we should all tryto do when you came along with here atwalk away campaign it's really funnyis cuz I didn't realize but when Iactually started trying to vocalizeweddings they believed in all the hateand the anger that I've actuallyacknowledged that a lot of people hadreally violent opinions but I didn'trealize how much that they were able tothrow people under a bus hope we're allon this boat together and um I thinkthat the time that we can actually talkum a lot of people have said it and youknow I've been following you know thankGod for Jordan Pearson oh my god a yearand a half ago started following him andI started actually looking and in doingresearch and instead of following likeyou know clickbait and things I foundactually sharing a little bit ofresearch I do a lot of research for myjob really for anything is when you'reactually orient research to trying tounderstand you actually have to listento both sides you really doit's funny people are trying to tell youthis is what you should believe andwhether it being dinner parties and andyou know meeting people that you careabout and you just can't it's no longeracceptable to have a different opinionthan great majority of people and WowI'd really love is to go back to thatyou're actually loved for yourdifferences not the things that you fallin step with but there are a lot ofwonderful people in the world and Ithink that humanity has to win out inthe end and so yeah I'm not a Russianbought and I'm doing this not because Iwanted to is you really asked to and Ithink that what you're doing is reallygoodand I really enjoy watching all thetestimonies of all the people that poston this and there's a lot of honesty anda lot of truth and a lot of love so walkaway Cheersyou

hey guys welcome back today's video isgonna be a lot different than what Inormally do with vlogging or camerareviews drone stuff etc the other daymaybe two or three days ago a video cameacross my recommended videos titledhashtag walk away and I was like what isthis hashtag walk away and why is it whyis it in my recommended videos so Iclicked on it and it was this guy who'sprobably I don't knowlate 40s talking on the screens andhashtag walk away before he startedtalking all rightwhat is he walking away what does hiswalk away so he starts talking andgiving his story and it's about how hewalked away from the Democrat Party andI was like oh that's pretty cool andthis story was really awesome I'm likethis is a good story I'm likeopen-minded guy got upset walked away soI'm not gonna vote for a Democratbecause my beliefs don't align with youanymoreand then autoplay you know happened tocame another video came up same thingwith the same long along the same linesand then another video in another videoin another videothey were all different people all walksof life all different colors alldifferent ages demographics were allcompletely different but they have onething in common they all walked awayfrom the Democrat Party like this isamazing why haven't I heard about thislike where has this been this isprobably at least like 10 12 years oldthat's why it's old videos and I'mthey're just coming up now because I'mwatching a lot of political stuff and itjust figured I'd like to see these no Iclicked on their dates and there arelike two months oldfour months old eight months old sevenmonths old it started last year like whydidn't I hear about this oh I know Ididn't hear about this because themainstream media blocks it you know ifit's not a it's not a Democrat or aliberal doesn't fit their agenda no thenwhy would we show it to you because wedon't want just getting out we don'twant you to know there's dissensionwithin the ranks that people are leavingthe party because we're all flippin nutsno they they don't want you to see thatstuff but it was it was started i thinkof 2018 by a guy named Brian and struckand the ironic thing about this is thatI I saw last night on Fox that was onFox News Channel but it was Mark Levintalking interviewing Brandon struck ohmy god this is really weird I'm like whyis this happening alright now but it wasit was amazing to hear this guy's storya gay what guy Liberal Democrat from NewYork City well losing here today fromNebraska walking away from the DemocratParty who he's been a part of his entirelifeit was amazing to hear that story nowI'm not a Democrat I figured I wanted toput this video out there to give mywalkaway story but I didn't really walkaway I want everybody to walk with meI'm gonna walk with personI'm already conservative I'm already aRepublican I never registered or votedfor a Democrat when I was a kid I didn'tknow what my grandparents partyaffiliation was I just knew that theywere all World War two Korean andVietnam veterans and they loved theircountryit didn't matter to me democrat orrepublican because back then when I was18 and I wrote I was registering thevote I didn't know the difference reallywhen you're 18 here you're in yourcocoon you're still you're stillfiguring out the world you haven'treally come out and seeing things asthey are you're still living in yourparents house you know you don't knowany better you see things that yourparents do to go okay well that's howthe world is because that's yourviewpoint you you don't have a worldviewyet because you didn't see anything so Iremember going down it's registered Italked to my dad the day before I saidhim my mom wasn't at home that time shewas like on her way home or somethingthat's my dad say I have to register tovote what do i what do I register as arep Republican or a Democrat he's likewell I'm a Republicanthat's okay well I guess I am too so Iwent down to register and happens to bethere that day that they were closed socome home and my mom's home now nicetalk to her about it she said well I'man independent and I'm like what theheck does that mean and she said thatyou know my viewpoints vary depending onthe person I said well that sounds likea good few point I mean I don't have tobe anything I can just be an independentso maybe I'll register an independenthow about you tell my dad this I'm justgonna register than pending so the nextchance I got I go down to the town hallinto the register registrar's office andI register as an independent and Ididn't know what that meant so my veryfirst election I was able to vote it wasGeorge Herbert Walker Bush versus BillClinton and primaries come around inAugust and in July August some time andI go to vote in the primaries well I getthereand the election official tells me thatI can't vote in the primary because I'man independent voter I need to pick aparty to vote with in the primary topick the candidate for president well Ididn't know that only how great so now Ican't go and vote for George Bush to beour nominee even though he was runningout of post[Music]I think that's how it happened so I godown to the general line I go to thegeneral election November I think I walkin as an independent and I vote forGeorge Bush because there's no way inhell I'm voting for both just didn'tagree with any of that boy's policies soI forget how it went exactly but thenext available time I went I went and Iregistered as a Republican so I couldvote with the primaries I was not gonnaregister as a Democrat because nobody inmy family that I knew ofat the time my meeting family anywayswas a Democrat so I registered as aRepublican the party platform aligned tomy views all conservative views strongmilitary second amendment smallgovernment everything I believed in thatwas who I aligned with and at the time Iwas going into the army for the next tenyears so I'm like why would I want to gowhy would I want to align myself with aparty who wants bigger government lessmilitary and more taxes there's no waythat I'm gonna I'm joining something themilitary service to protect our countryand yourgoing to tell me that you're takingmoney away from national defense to putin the programs like welfare where thesepeople can't help themselves sometimesdepending on the situation not somepeople on welfare are you are helplessbut there are a good amount that arejust gaming the system I'm like I don'twant any part of that so that started myjourney into or opening my eyes I shouldsay into conservatism and and what itmeans and the older I got the more Ilearned and I continually voted forRepublican candidates and in 2007November 2007 when I voted for JohnMcCain over Barack Obama I knew in mygut I'm like there's no way that JohnMcCain is gonna beat this guy this guyhas way too much charisma and it seemslike everybody in the world loves usdude I don't even know who the hell heweighs I hadn't heard of them before andtill the July previous like I don't knowanything about himI know is he's a Democrat seems to be apretty good smooth a smooth talker thatdidn't jive well with me but when he gotelected I'm like all right well he's mypresident what am I gonna do about it Idon't like his policies but let's seewhat happensthis is the firstblack president that we have had thiscould be a great thing for the countrybring us all closer togetherwho knows wrong answer it was thecomplete opposite direction now if youdidn't agree with what the president wassaying you were racist or Nazi orxenophobe anything further from thetruth but if you didn't agree with whatBarack Obama was saying you were wrongand you were labeled what is going onwhy am I being labeled what why arethese Democrats throwing labels at me Idon't throw labels at them like I neverhad

guys welcome back today's video isgonna be a lot different than what Inormally do with vlogging or camerareviews drone stuff etc the other daymaybe two or three days ago a video cameacross my recommended videos titledhashtag walk away and I was like what isthis hashtag walk away and why is it whyis it in my recommended videos so Iclicked on it and it was this guy who'sprobably I don't knowlate 40s talking on the screens andhashtag walk away before he startedtalking all rightwhat is he walking away what does hiswalk away so he starts talking andgiving his story and it's about how hewalked away from the Democrat Party andI was like oh that's pretty cool andthis story was really awesome I'm likethis is a good story I'm likeopen-minded guy got upset walked away soI'm not gonna vote for a Democratbecause my beliefs don't align with youanymoreand then autoplay you know happened tocame another video came up same thingwith the same long along the same linesand then another video in another videoin another videothey were all different people all walksof life all different colors alldifferent ages demographics were allcompletely different but they have onething in common they all walked awayfrom the Democrat Party like this isamazing why haven't I heard about thislike where has this been this isprobably at least like 10 12 years oldthat's why it's old videos and I'mthey're just coming up now because I'mwatching a lot of political stuff and itjust figured I'd like to see these no Iclicked on their dates and there arelike two months oldfour months old eight months old sevenmonths old it started last year like whydidn't I hear about this oh I know Ididn't hear about this because themainstream media blocks it you know ifit's not a it's not a Democrat or aliberal doesn't fit their agenda no thenwhy would we show it to you because wedon't want just getting out we don'twant you to know there's dissensionwithin the ranks that people are leavingthe party because we're all flippin nutsno they they don't want you to see thatstuff but it was it was started i thinkof 2018 by a guy named Brian and struckand the ironic thing about this is thatI I saw last night on Fox that was onFox News Channel but it was Mark Levintalking interviewing Brandon struck ohmy god this is really weird I'm like whyis this happening alright now but it wasit was amazing to hear this guy's storya gay what guy Liberal Democrat from NewYork City well losing here today fromNebraska walking away from the DemocratParty who he's been a part of his entirelifeit was amazing to hear that story nowI'm not a Democrat I figured I wanted toput this video out there to give mywalkaway story but I didn't really walkaway I want everybody to walk with meI'm gonna walk with personI'm already conservative I'm already aRepublican I never registered or votedfor a Democrat when I was a kid I didn'tknow what my grandparents partyaffiliation was I just knew that theywere all World War two Korean andVietnam veterans and they loved theircountryit didn't matter to me democrat orrepublican because back then when I was18 and I wrote I was registering thevote I didn't know the difference reallywhen you're 18 here you're in yourcocoon you're still you're stillfiguring out the world you haven'treally come out and seeing things asthey are you're still living in yourparents house you know you don't knowany better you see things that yourparents do to go okay well that's howthe world is because that's yourviewpoint you you don't have a worldviewyet because you didn't see anything so Iremember going down it's registered Italked to my dad the day before I saidhim my mom wasn't at home that time shewas like on her way home or somethingthat's my dad say I have to register tovote what do i what do I register as arep Republican or a Democrat he's likewell I'm a Republicanthat's okay well I guess I am too so Iwent down to register and happens to bethere that day that they were closed socome home and my mom's home now nicetalk to her about it she said well I'man independent and I'm like what theheck does that mean and she said thatyou know my viewpoints vary depending onthe person I said well that sounds likea good few point I mean I don't have tobe anything I can just be an independentso maybe I'll register an independenthow about you tell my dad this I'm justgonna register than pending so the nextchance I got I go down to the town hallinto the register registrar's office andI register as an independent and Ididn't know what that meant so my veryfirst election I was able to vote it wasGeorge Herbert Walker Bush versus BillClinton and primaries come around inAugust and in July August some time andI go to vote in the primaries well I getthereand the election official tells me thatI can't vote in the primary because I'man independent voter I need to pick aparty to vote with in the primary topick the candidate for president well Ididn't know that only how great so now Ican't go and vote for George Bush to beour nominee even though he was runningout of post[Music]I think that's how it happened so I godown to the general line I go to thegeneral election November I think I walkin as an independent and I vote forGeorge Bush because there's no way inhell I'm voting for both just didn'tagree with any of that boy's policies soI forget how it went exactly but thenext available time I went I went and Iregistered as a Republican so I couldvote with the primaries I was not gonnaregister as a Democrat because nobody inmy family that I knew ofat the time my meeting family anywayswas a Democrat so I registered as aRepublican the party platform aligned tomy views all conservative views strongmilitary second amendment smallgovernment everything I believed in thatwas who I aligned with and at the time Iwas going into the army for the next tenyears so I'm like why would I want to gowhy would I want to align myself with aparty who wants bigger government lessmilitary and more taxes there's no waythat I'm gonna I'm joining something themilitary service to protect our countryand yourgoing to tell me that you're takingmoney away from national defense to putin the programs like welfare where thesepeople can't help themselves sometimesdepending on the situation not somepeople on welfare are you are helplessbut there are a good amount that arejust gaming the system I'm like I don'twant any part of that so that started myjourney into or opening my eyes I shouldsay into conservatism and and what itmeans and the older I got the more Ilearned and I continually voted forRepublican candidates and in 2007November 2007 when I voted for JohnMcCain over Barack Obama I knew in mygut I'm like there's no way that JohnMcCain is gonna beat this guy this guyhas way too much charisma and it seemslike everybody in the world loves usdude I don't even know who the hell heweighs I hadn't heard of them before andtill the July previous like I don't knowanything about himI know is he's a Democrat seems to be apretty good smooth a smooth talker thatdidn't jive well with me but when he gotelected I'm like all right well he's mypresident what am I gonna do about it Idon't like his policies but let's seewhat happensthis is the firstblack president that we have had thiscould be a great thing for the countrybring us all closer togetherwho knows wrong answer it was thecomplete opposite direction now if youdidn't agree with what the president wassaying you were racist or Nazi orxenophobe anything further from thetruth but if you didn't agree with whatBarack Obama was saying you were wrongand you were labeled what is going onwhy am I being labeled what why arethese Democrats throwing labels at me Idon't throw labels at them like I neverhad my entire life why are they throwinghim at me this makes zero senseso 2012 comes around I vote for Romneyagain Obama gets in same thingalright well carry on NIDA agree todisagree and try to find some

hi my name is Tyrone Jackson and I wouldlike to share my walkaway story with youyou know I've learned that there comes apoint when you realize that you don'tknow something and it's only at thatpoint that you realize that prior tothat point you didn't know what youdidn't know well I kind of stumbledacross that pointin 2005 when I actually started mybusiness my little hotdog stand a yearafter graduating from college this wasthe moment or the time period that Iactually walked away from the DemocraticParty and walked into being aconservative you see when I graduated Ihad studied before when I was in schoolI had studied pre-law and I had thebrilliant idea in my last year that Iwanted to study business but since Iused all my undergrad time I would haveto learn on the fly I would have tolearn on the job and so you know I I wasfine with that the only thing I reallyknew was that I didn't know anythingabout business so that put me in aposition where I had to learn I did alot of research did a lot of reading dida lot of studyingI checked out Kiyosaki Napoleon Hill Ichecked out Kirt of T Harv Eker DaveRamsey and I started to find out veryquickly that it seemed like business hadsomething to do with personaldevelopment and that I may need to tryto broaden my experience base and almostredefine myself a lot if I was going tobe successful in business so a part ofthat process was actually trying tolisten to and learn about Republicans Idon't know where it came from but I'mglad that happenedI remember sitting on my bed with mywith my fiancee my smokin hot light nowMarcellaand um we were listening to Glenn Beckas a part of this process you know thecrybaby got the Barker you know this wasbefore he pulled out the whiteboard andall that other foolishness and lost hismind but he was talking he was given aspeech aboutconservatism and what it means to be aconservative and he was talking aboutgovernment and he was saying thatgovernment is the problem and it waskind of weird because we had just gotour business license and we just leftthe government buildings so we found outthat taxes are real oh my god likethey're not just income taxes weconsidered everything to be in taxes wehad to get business license businesspermits business insurances all thesethings we had to pay before we were evenallowed to to set up a business andsomething like a thousand dollars it wascrazy and then they wanted us to becometax collectors on top of that it was itwas absolutely not to mingle I rememberGlenn Beck talking about that businessis part of [ __ ] my business um thegovernment is actually completelyinefficient it says there are probablythe last people that you would actuallywant to ask for help and I was like goodlord isn't that the truth I mean nobodyin the government knew anything theydidn't know any of the steps in theprocess to getting something done eventhough they initiated the process and Imean the people there were just likereally the worst people customer serviceyou ever did want to meet that's likethat there was a few people that werenice but I'm sure they found better jobswho somewhere else but I rememberlooking at Marcela and my fiancee andsaying you know MarcelaI think we're conservatives I think wereally might be Republicans and as welistened we became convinced and wenever looked back things life changewhen we I mean we jumped in with bothfeet started looking at the Constitutionand we started looking at the Tea Partyit just was lovely what we were seeingbut um we also we also realized that thethe media their message actuallydistorted the view of conservatives itliterally distorted the public view ofconservatives and I mean that onlyacceleratedTrump came on the scene I mean by thistime when chomp came on the scenes ourlittle hot dog card had morphed into asmall hole selling hot dog operation wemade our own frankfurters and sausagesand even the in frankfurters don't don'tdon't don't ask it's it's a long storythe vegan thing can't go into that herebut um we were really excited withtrumping we were so grateful when he wonbecause we felt like America's youdidn't build that day as in kind of thiswhole Obama principle of demonizingAmericans and American ethics was behindus and so we actually ended up going towe're so happy to a trump rally duringlast midterms and it was really excitingour whole family of four children forhome school children we all went and wegot to sit on the stage it was amazingTrump people pointed to this end it'slike a biggie was mostly pointing to mywife things to call you guys you'rebeautiful and my kids are like but itwas great it was great but when we gothome I actually learned something elsethat I didn't know I didn't realize howmuch the left actually hated DonaldTrump and more importantly hatedconservatives like me didn't realizethis I did not realize it when I gotback or shortly thereafter a smearcampaign was created and was launchedagainst me at my business and even ourlandlord where we rented kitchen spacehe our leftist landlord you didn't renewour contracts and it effectively put usout of business and I said I'm not gonnalet this diss destroy us I'm not gonnalet this this this thing I'm not gonnalet these people win this is my countryso I dollars Marcella told you I'd do itbut anyway I said we're going to fightit and I was like not only are we gonnareopen our business but we're gonna takethis opportunity to do something that'sincredibly needed we're going to openour business reopen our business and tobuild an entrepreneurial learningkitchen for people in the inner citylike us that didn't know what theydidn't know that want to do more withtheir lives but they don't have thepractical steps the incourage MIT the financial situation inorder to actually make that happen we'regonna act as a bridge and we're going tofight or combat this this whole smearjob that has been done on conservativesby connecting conservatives directlywith these people who the left isexploited in I'm glad to report that weactually got we actually just finishednegotiating a great deal with thekitchen and we're going to be moving innext month

hey everyone I just want to start bysaying how encouraging this walkawaymovement is how amazing it is readingeverybody's post and I think the reasonthis movement so successful is becauseof the sincerity and openness ofeveryone involved of all the individualpeople so thank you for that I wasactually raised conservative so I have adifferent kind of walk away story Inever identified as liberal I was alwayskind of in the thick of it cuz I wasyoung and mouthy and I would get into itwith all these people and it was fineyou know like playful banter and so theObama era and everything just kind ofwent downhill so fastpeople are calling you outrageous namesaying unbelievable things to you andyou're just going not sure where you'recoming from you seem like you hate me Idon't even know you so after like eightyears of that I was pretty over it I wastired of being called names I was tiredof being told to be quiet to keep youropinions to yourself you know you'rebegging at your racism oh wow thatreally convenient list at the left hasof like 25 names that they call youwe've heard them all their ball been onthe cover I've seen and anybody that'sconservative you will get called those25 names it's fine so I just got tiredof fighting honestly I hate to admitthat but I just I laid down and I waslike I'm putting on my sleep mask andI'm done reading politics and I'm tiredof arguing with people tired of beingcalled a racist I'm tired of being toldthat believing in God makes you ignorantand all of it I was just a goof so Iyeah that's embarrassing but I laid downI really did I just laid down and I saidI'm donegood night world so when Trump ran Icouldn't believe it I was like what'shappening and I didn't think he wouldwin because he's saying things that Isay and he seems to hold beliefs that Ihold and I'm going this is impossiblewe're the minority I've beenfor years we live in liberal land nobodywants guns everybody loves to killchildren this is phenomenallike leave all the Conservatives aregonna die up we're gonna have thisliberal utopia yeah what he saidso but Trump won so it was this huge lieall along that you know Patriots andpeople that love their family peoplethat serve our country like we're themajority and and CNN and theentertainment industry and everybodyjust hood like hood wing to me I'm notcalling anybody else on that but I'msaying me I bought it I ate it I like Iate it right up I was like yeahliberalism we don't have a chanceeverybody hates God okay whatever I likethat the world's gonna suck so I did andI believed I believed they'll stopkicking me when I go down you don't kicka dog when it's down but they do they doand and I just and I went you know whatthis is this is enough and this isridiculous so my walk away is kind of aget up and walk away I'm having to getup from my position of going I quit I'vegot to get up and walk away from feelingoppressed believing lies beingcontrolled by the left even though Iwasn't supporting them I was stillserving their agenda because I was likeyeah y'all can have it I'm forget it youcan you guys do it I'm sick of it andI'm a punk and I just apologize to allof you guys I gave up but so I'm I'mwalking away from my own self-pity myown place that I put myself in that wejust can't do this anymorewe can and the truth can win and it willwin and the left is freaking out becauseof all of you amazing people beingcourageous and telling your truth andtelling the truth about your country andabout your lives and your experiencesand theycan't shut us up and it's amazing so Ijust wanted to stop by today and say youguys are so great and you're sowonderful and I just want to encourageeverybody to use their voice for thetruth because it really is the mostpowerful thing that we have and I justpray that God will give strength andcourage to all the people that feelconvicted to tell the truth because itis the most important thing that we havemy name is Cristian and you guys havenot heard the last for me
hello I'm Devon E and this is my walkaway story so I grew up reallyuneducated in real life politics youknow the schools they teach you thehistory of politics but I can't everrecall any actual discussions ofnational leaders today in politics todayso I was in eighth grade when Hillaryand Obama were running against eachother and I remember that a lot moreadults were wanting to vote for Hillaryand I had this disillusion that Hillarywould be a better president because ofher husband and because of theexperience she already had I was 18 inthe 2012 election but I hadn'tregistered to vote yet because I hadn'treally found the part of me that caredabout politics yet so I didn't vote atthat time though I was hoping that Obamawould win because what a very littlethat I had read gave me this belief thatRomney would end all of these assistantprograms I was relying on as a teen momI believed at the time that I was boundto a life of welfare and handouts so in2014 I decided to register to vote and Iwas set on voting for Hillary but Inever like went looking to educatemyself on what she stood for and who shewas really and then in 2015 a formerfriend of mine had told me about BernieSanders and as a 21 year old with nolike real knowledge all of this soundedamazing to me it was pre-college it washigher wages this is everything that Ineeded in life to succeed I bought intothis fear-mongering that Trump'spresidency was going to bring globaldisasters and it was the end of timesfor us and we were going to go intoanother depression and you knowso I woke up on the day of my 23rdbirthday to read that Trump had won theelection and I cried I was devastatedbut soon after I myself was really kindof disgusted at the behavior that I wasseeing from the Democrats you know he'snot my [ __ ] president and the riotingbut the worst thing I had seen waspeople hoping for him to fail I'm likethat makes no sense that's like mesaying I hope my mom gets to drugaddiction why would you want your leaderto fail if you didn't vote for him youshould at least hope that he proved youwrong I just thought that was a dumbthing to say I was hoping that Trump wasgonna prove me wrong so it was about thefall of 2017 after like the Charlestonriots and whatnot I had to take a deepstep back from social media I felt likeI was suffocating there was just so muchhate and it was all pointed towardsTrump and the white man and I hadwatched one clip of Candice Owens sayingwhat you're seeing here is the victimmentality versus the Victoire mentalityand that's when just like it was like anepiphany it hit meyou know Democrats really are the racistones you know they're trying to takeaway our amendments and I as a historymajor didn't like that I valued peoplelike Martin Luther King and Lincoln whoI would say are my heroes you know Ivalue their courage and their words andyou know Lincoln was the one who foundedthe Republican Party for freeing slaveryand black rights and honestly I'vesupported the wall the whole time so Iwalked away and in that moment it justit felt like I could breathe again and Istarted to see that politics are as awhole it was like a cult I know like yousee both sides of the party calling eachtheir cult and I think that's what it isis I see a lot of brainwash I noticedthat a lot of people talk themselves incircles and they never actually make avalid point and they don't reallyunderstand what they're fighting forthere they're fighting without knowingwhat they're doing and it felt to melike we the citizens we're justperpetuated to spread hate and fightamongst ourselves so we're not focusingon these greedy career politicians whoare failing to get anything done to helpus but they're racking in millions ofdollars themselves and they're notactually struggling they don'tunderstand what it's like living downhere so I went looking and I started toread all of the great things that Trumpwas doing you know he was doing amazingthings like I am one of the familiesthat have gotten off of food stampssince he's become president it's greatand I just have this whole outlook onlife it took me a while to find but likeI want to see the good in people and Iwant to find the beautiful the beautyand everything and so even though Ididn't vote for Trump I proudly supporthim now because I went looking for thegood I don't want to spread hate and Idon't want to keep hate within my ownself um I stand on a platform to makeAmerica love again I support Magga Iwant to make America love again and Iwant to make America kind again I wantto stop the hate I want to reach my handacross the aisle and I just I want tohave these discussions where we disagreebut we can find common ground to standupon and I want to make America loveagain[Music]hello I'm Devon E and this is my walkaway story so I grew up reallyuneducated in real life politics youknow the schools they teach you thehistory of politics but I can't everrecall any actual discussions ofnational leaders today in politics todayso I was in eighth grade when Hillaryand Obama were running against eachother and I remember that a lot moreadults were wanting to vote for Hillaryand I had this disillusion that Hillarywould be a better president because ofher husband and because of theexperience she already had I was 18 inthe 2012 election but I hadn'tregistered to vote yet because I hadn'treally found the part of me that caredabout politics yet so I didn't vote atthat time though I was hoping that Obamawould win because what a very littlethat I had read gave me this belief thatRomney would end all of these assistantprograms I was relying on as a teen momI believed at the time that I was boundto a life of welfare and handouts so in2014 I decided to register to vote and Iwas set on voting for Hillary but Inever like went looking to educatemyself on what she stood for and who shewas really and then in 2015 a formerfriend of mine had told me about BernieSanders and as a 21 year old with nolike real knowledge all of this soundedamazing to me it was pre-college it washigher wages this is everything that Ineeded in life to succeed I bought intothis fear-mongering that Trump'spresidency was going to bring globaldisasters and it was the end of timesfor us and we were going to go intoanother depression and you knowso I woke up on the day of my 23rdbirthday to read that Trump had won theelection and I cried I was devastatedbut soon after I myself was really kindof disgusted at the behavior that I wasseeing from the Democrats you know he'snot my [ __ ] president and the riotingbut the worst thing I had seen waspeople hoping for him to fail I'm likethat makes no sense that's like mesaying I hope my mom gets to drugaddiction why would you want your leaderto fail if you didn't vote for him youshould at least hope that he proved youwrong I just thought that was a dumbthing to say I was hoping that Trump wasgonna prove me wrong so it was about thefall of 2017 after like the Charlestonriots and whatnot I had to take a deepstep back from social media I felt likeI was suffocating there was just so muchhate and it was all pointed towardsTrump and the white man and I hadwatched one clip of Candice Owens sayingwhat you're seeing here is the victimmentality versus the Victoire mentalityand that's when just like it was like anepiphany it hit meyou know Democrats really are the racistones you know they're trying to takeaway our amendments and I as a historymajor didn't like that I valued peoplelike Martin Luther King and Lincoln whoI would say are my heroes you know Ivalue their courage and their words andyou know Lincoln was the one who foundedthe Republican Party for freeing slaveryand black rights and honestly I'vesupported the wall the whole time so Iwalked away and in that moment it justit felt like I could breathe again and Istarted to see that politics are as awhole it was like a cult I know like yousee both sides of the party calling eachtheir cult and I think that's what it isis I see a lot of brainwash I noticedthat a lot of people talk themselves incircles and they never actually make avalid point and they don't reallyunderstand what they're fighting forthere they're fighting without knowingwhat they're doing and it felt to melike we the citizens we're justperpetuated to spread hate and fightamongst ourselves so we're not focusingon these greedy career politicians whoare failing to get anything done to helpus but they're racking in millions ofdollars themselves and they're notactually struggling they don'tunderstand what it's like living downhere so I went looking and I started toread all of the great things that Trumpwas doing you know he was doing amazingthings like I am one of the familiesthat have gotten off of food stampssince he's become president it's greatand I just have this whole outlook onlife it took me a while to find but likeI want to see the good in people and Iwant to find the

manplease
we Pete say all right say hi the folkslet's go hey guys it's joe here and I'vegot my liberal read on today and my makeCanada great again hat on today for agood reason I want to talk to you aboutthis walkaway campaign that I've seen onTwitter for the last couple days Ididn't really know much about theorigins of it I kind of got the gistfrom the tweets I saw it was largelydisaffected liberals primarily Democratsdisaffected Democrats in the UnitedStates expressing their dissatisfactionand disillusionment with the DemocraticParty so they have I went and lookedinto it and I saw it was started by thisgentleman named Brandon Strakaand he's got a quick little two-minutevideo on his profile where he explainsthe campaign and it's pretty much what Ithought but you know hearing himarticulated from his viewpoints you knowgave me that gave me the full scoop sofrom what I could gather he was onceidentified as a liberal and he opens thevideo by addressing groups that the nowthe neoliberals the neo progressives whoco-opted the liberal label is what I'llcall them because they're not liberalsthe groups that they tend to agitate andadvocate on behalf of so called in thename to do it in the name of toleranceand diversity and all the other partyslogans that they toss around here thatare devoid of any real meaning anymoreand essentially explains to them thathis opinion and the opinion shared bymany many others I could tell you thatis that the the far left neo progressivetypes who have co-opted the liberallabel they don't care anything for thesegroups they're only using these groupsso they can stand on their backs toattain power and that's exactly what'shappening in Canada with the Trudeauliberals we're seeing the exact samething like the Democrats in the UnitedStates the Trudeau BOTS liberals theGerald buts liberalshave become the party of illegalimmigrants asylum seekers you know andother various interest groups radicalIslamist groups you know this is this iswho they're batting for now completelyleaving countrysorry Canadians I was a picture theyhave no interest in us anymore theydon't care about us anymoreand folks like me who the Liberals wouldidentify is a cisgendered white male I'mnot one of their victim groups which isprobably largely why I saw the writingon the wall along before folks like mr.Strack II here may have an I don't knowthe the timing of it I'm not saying hehimself didn't realize this but folks inhis situation who maybe identify as gayor their an immigrant to Canada or theUnited States where they've largelybelieved what the Liberals the neoprogressive liberals have been tellingthem for so long that they are victimsand that the only people advocating forthem are the Liberal Democrats in theUnited States in the Liberal Party ofCanada here at North so the fact thematter is that's not the caseand more and more people are waking upto this more and more people are walkingaway I walked away a few years agomyself I left the Liberal Party I votedfor Justin Trudeau in the last electionand I voted liberal pretty much most ofmy life coming up but in this comingfederal election I will not be votingfor the Liberal Party of Canada I willbe voting conservative federally for thefirst time ever I'm also a card-carryingmember of the Conservative Party nowbecause I do feel that they betterrepresent the classical liberal viewsthat are held by many of us who now feeldisaffected by the liberal left the theintolerant liberal left who beats usover the head with terms like homophobiaand transphobia and Islamophobia andxenophobia if we criticize any of theirpolicy decisions that they're trying topush in the so-called name of toleranceto defend the little guy as they like toportray it you know it's that what is itthe soft bigotry of low expectationsthat's pretty much what the liberal leftoperates on now they just don't givethese groups in credit and well the factthat they choose to identify the muffinsegment them up by their groups showsexactly how far the Liberals have gonethere into the collectivist socialistterritory nowthere's nothing liberal about them theydon't even hide it anymore so you knowas it stands right now in Canada we'reabout a year away from an election whichis poised to be held sometime around Ibelieve the date would be October 21st2019 would be the latest date theLiberals could call an election any timebetween now and then in fact there'sbeen talk about them possibly calling anearlier election so you know if you'renot if maybe you're confused politicallyor you you have some questions aboutyour political allegiance you knowthere's a wealth of information outthere to go look into what the differentpolitical parties are doing and make aninformed decision and folks like me youknow making these videos we're doing itso we can have a conversation with folkswho still identify as being in theliberal camp but you know maybe theyhave some they have some disillusionsabout that and they have some questionsand some concerns about what they'reseeing from their liberalrepresentatives and they don't quiteknow how to articulate it or make a casecriticism without being labeled you knowany of the choice ad hominem attacksthat the intolerant liberal left likesto hurl at us nowadays for for simplyopposing simply opposing the view of theanointed these high priests ofprogressive ideology who've co-opted theliberal labelmost people most people in the west'swould fit the classical definition ofliberal and I think many people hold onto this hope that the Liberal Party ofCanada the Democrats in the US becausethey still tout the liberal label thatit still means the same thing to thembut it just certainly does not mean thesame thing to them whatsoeverand when you come to this realizationit's the perfect time to walk away
hello everyone this is my walk awayvideo my name is Joe this is take howmany at this point it's over it's over100 that I can tell you that muchthese things are not easy to make by theway and I've been putting off makingthis for a long time now for variousreasons it's sort of excuses to now youwouldn't think that one of those excusesis hey I want to find the exact perfectbackground and the perfect lighting andthings like thatfrom where I am now but I finally cameto the conclusion to just try to do thiswhere I was most comfortable and so herewe go um so I was Democrat I wasDemocrat for for thirty years from 1986to 2016 and I grew up in New Englandwhere many people are are Democrats andliberals not all mind you but many and Iwas taught or maybe told at that earlyage that Democrats were the party of thelittle guy the party of the working manthe party the downtrodden the party ofpeople that needed help and I was alsotaught that Republicans were the big badmeanies that only cared aboutcorporations and money and of courseeverything around me sort of seemed tosupport that as well too even back thenI never questioned it I never really didI was a loyal Democrat voter for all mylife I I'm not terribly proud of it butI wasn't even that terriblywell-informed and in Florida I used tojust go to the polls and and and I wouldassume that the Democrats had my bestinterest in mind and justchecking the D boxes and then go homeget my iphone sticker so 2016 rollsaround and I want to vote for BernieSanders and and that sort of changedthings for me you know back then youstarted kind of I think you had to kindof realize that things weren't exactlyright and then of course I'm not gonnarehash turnout but some of the thingsthat really sort of woke me up not justthe fact that they they rigged theprimary election but they admitted it incourt they actually went to court andsaid you know we did that and it waslegal I guess to the judge I don't knowapparently ruled that it was legal andand what really opened my eyes with itwas that no one really covered thatstory the press seems hardly a blip onthe press I mean it was the kind ofthing where where no one really evenseem to care now you would think that ifeveryone hated Donald Trump is bad asthey said they did back then that wouldbe a bigger story right becausebasically things could have beendifferent so it should have been well Imean it should have been something closeto Watergate I mean it was a big shouldabeen a big story but but but it didn'treceive any coverage at all and and itstarted to make me really kind of wonderyou know what's going on here and Istarted to sort of peel back the layersof the onion now it doesn't take much wedon't really hide it termi we do theythey don't attempt to hide it very wellthey the Democrats my job they are theparty of optics think they they theymanipulate us into into believing thatthey are the appear Amin the appearanceof something but they aren't thosethings at all there are only theappearance of those thingsonce you start peeling back the layersyou find that that there's well there'sthere's a really dark underbelly there'sa lot there that's really badnow I really sort of dug into it youknow early on there and a lot of it kindof shocked me and I didn't believe itall are there but but if even half of itwas wrong it was still really bad andthat's when I started kind of reallyquestioning everything like like hey amI being lied toI'm certainly being lied to how badly amI being lied tohow often it might be lied to how youknow how by whom it might be like youlike like is any of what I see in actualactually the truth in any way and Wowso it it's it's hard to wrap your headaround and I think that's probably oneof the reasons why it's been difficultfor me to kind of make this video -because you're trying to take it all andput it into something where you thinkyou can digest it all whatever right soyou know to be able to kind of say heythis is what's wrong but it it's hard todo it's hard to do because it's alwayschanging it's still going on like likeit's basically it's constantly going onand I think a lot of us now see how badit is I mean you can you know you cansee that the lies that should have beenobvious you know the hoaxes you know thelies they're trying to make us believeare true when you can obviously look atand go let doesn't look right to me itisn't there anything more you can giveme to try to try to make me you knowbelieve what you're saying here but ohno no I should just believe it becausesome if I don't know more racist reallythat's kind of a hard sellyeah and so here I am Here I am I'm nolonger democrat and and and I wish I hadsomething better you know I wish I hadthat that way to take everything andkind of go and here it is but I can't itreally is too big I think I can I canhonestly say one thing though and that'sI've come to the conclusion that theDemocrats are there either plugged intoor they are actively working a systemthat the intent of that system is is tokeep us from being able to identify thethings that threaten us as individualsthat threaten us our families threatenedour communities and that threaten ourour our country they don't want us to beable to identify those things they'drather not us know the things that theycan really really maybe miss our livesup and that's not goodthese aren't people that these thesethese aren't your friends these aren'tpeople that that should be representingus and I'm I don't know it's gonna behard for me to kind of conclude here Itried to kind of to team to maintain adecent attitude about it all butrealistically I end up really reallykind of mad because I feel like I'vereally really been lied toshould never have been lied she wasbadly I don't think any of us shouldhave been lied to as badly as we havebeen lied to and I guess that's where Ishould probably believe this andconclude so thanks for for watching thisand I hope that I hope this this thiscould this renounce with somebody outthere some white guy or whatever I don'tknow thanks for watching[Music]
everyone my name is Kimberly I'm 34years old I am from Colorado born andraised I've recently moved to Arizona alittle bit of my backstory I guessgrowing up I felt like I was in aDemocratic household my parents didn'treally talk about politics much at allwhich is basically kind of Howard's likemy life is to just not talk about itbecause it's gonna cause problems you'regonna lose friends you know like thingslike that so we just didn't really talkabout it a whole lot I don't think Ieven know who my mom has ever voted forI do know that when I was in collegeback when Bush was about to getreelected I did vote that year and Iremember when Bush got elected for asecond term just feeling sick like I wasI was at CU and Boulder very liberal andI just had this gut feeling that it wasjust this is the worst thing I don'teven think it was a gut feeling actuallyI just feel like I was told you know tobelieve that there's no way that he canget reelected and then when he did itwas just it was the end of everythingyou know we're really in troubleSarge's I still I didn't really pay muchattention to politics I kind of feltshitty for a day for lack of a betterway to put it and then I kind of justput it in the back of my mind again youknow so and then as far as the electionsthat came after I can't even remember ifI vote it's that's pretty bad I justit's just always been you know I justdidn't really pay that much attention topoliticsI felt very liberal because I lived inBoulder I'm from Colorado you know yayweedyay abortion all of those things andit's really crazy what's been happeninglately becauseI think the turning point for me wasprobably it was last fall during thewhole cabin mouthing I remember feelingso enraged when that was going on thewhole me to move me and the reason Ifelt enraged is not because of personalexperience but because of people that Iknow and things that have happened topeople that I know and I just rememberthe Democratic Party just bring out thisthis hate you know towards this man andI felt it ignoring 100% guilty that Iwas like oh my god he should never be inthere you know there's no way that thiscan happen like this is terribleand then um I started listening to AlexJones and I kind of brushed it off youknow deeds all were crazy he's got somepretty extreme thoughts but then Ireally you know for being liberal asmuch as you have an open mind right Ididn't feel like I did really have anopen mind because the conservative sideof things and the Republicans you knowgrowing up the way that I did it wasjust that wasn't the party for me youknow they were religious I've never beenreligious I didn't grow up that way umI've been to church a few times likewith friends during sleepovers orwhatever so I didn't feel a connectionthere I've always felt you know that theliberal side is where I belonged and soonce I started listening to Alex andjust doing a lot more of my own researchas hard as that is with all thecensorship and whatnot as we all knowthat's going on and it's very much goingon not a conspiracy theory um instead ofjust researching as much as I could andthe prior or the midterms when theyhappen back in November I I felt verymuch that I could not vote Democrat on alovedI didn't believe in a lot of the peopleI didn't I did as much research as Icould because you know it's really hardwhen politics hasn't even been a part ofmy life really for a long time so Itried to understand as much as I couldI basically voted mostly Republican on alot of the issues and so that was kindof a tipping point and then recentlywithout everything has been going andthe more and more censorship that'shappening and just the more and more I'mseeing so much hate from that party andfrom the people and just slandering thepresident I mean it's ridiculousI mean I'm preaching to the choir hereeverybody knows this is just out ofcontrolI mean we're throwing the race cardaround like there's nothing else andit's just it's so insane I can't I can'tso I've been doing a lot of my ownresearch and it's I mean this campaignthis whole walk away thing isunbelievable I'm so glad that Brandonand it's brought this to light becauseyou know there's a lot obviously there'sa lot of us folks that kind of you knowfelt like the Democratic Party was theparty for us whether that means you knowyou're a minority or you're in the LGBTQcommunity or you know like I don't knowyou're tattooed you don't go to churchlike I don't I don't fall on either sidecompletely I have to be honest there'sRepublican issues that I don't agreewith there's obviously a lot on theDemocrat side I'm realizing that I don'tagree with so just being able to havethis campaign and being able to talk toyou know hear from a lot of otherlike-minded individuals who are alsojust like holy [ __ ] this is insaneum it's been really really helpful it'staken me a while to make this videoI haven't really been open about it withpeople that I know I already know I'mgonna get met with a lot of hostilityand a lot of resistance from a lot ofpeople and probably people that I callvery good friends hopefully they arevery good friends then they'll realizethat you know different opinions doesn'thave to mean that we can't be friendsmaybe we just don't talk about politicsbut at this point I think we have totalk about politics I mean what ishappening is just so insane that if wedon't talk about it and we don'tactually stand up for ourselves like wewere gonna collapse or it's just it'shorrifying especially after watchingthose debates last night I meaneverything that they are saying justfollows like leading to communismit's insane we this public health carething is paying off everybody studentloans being free health care foreverybody like I don't feel likeanybody's actually sat down with acalculator and done the numbers likeYang and his thousand dollars a monthfor everybody like oh my godyeah there's so much money doesn't comefrom anywhere but like or from nowhereyou know if we could just give awayeverything for free don't you think thatwould already be happening it's notgonna happenso anyways give me what was that checkedbut basically I just I want to thankeverybody in

knowmet with a lot of hostility from Menaprotesters or whatever but screw it youknow I mean it's whatever I just I guessmy walkaway story pretty much is nowthat I'm paying attention I've woken upand we have to do something we just andit seems like I mean it seems like theDemocrats are basically helping Trumpget elected I mean last night was justeverybody basically agreeing /disagreeing but agreeing that Trump campshouldn't be president which obviouslyyou're trying to run against him we knowthat that's your standpoint um but justnot forgetting where I was that buteither way I mean we as citizens of thiscountry have to stand up we have to dosomething I mean I haven't been a bigvoter in the pastI'm absolutely voting in 2020 prettysure I already know for who look unlesssomebody else

hi everybody I just would like to say alittle few words about what has happenedsince I've made my original walkawayvideo um since then I've been recognizedtwice at my job by people that I barelyeven know they came across my videoonline and they stopped me and told meprivately that they had seen it and thenthey had thanked me for itboth of these people are part of theLatino community one of them inparticular she shared with me that shehas illegal friends and family and she'shad some that has actually been deportedshe said they were deported because theyhad been here for so long and didn'tbother filling out paperwork or doinganything necessary to stay she told methese are her words she just said thatthey are entitled privileged people andthey thought because they were here andyou know they were getting away with itthat they didn't have to do anything tomake it right until they got deportedand she said she won't feel sorry forhim she said that her family has beenhere for over a hundred years and thatshe's an American and she sees herselfas an American first and that's that'skind of like myself I come fromimmigrants um I'm also gay but I seemyself as an American first I I livehere I'm an American I was born here I'ma legal citizen I'm an American um andthat's how she sees herself and I justthink that that's a great thing shedon't see herself as Mexican she seesherself as American she also stated thatin her community that she lives in she'svery offended that people fly them theMexican flag and they do it in myneighborhood too but she is extremelyoffended by that because she said shelives here in America and her ethnicitydoes not definehurt her national patriotism it's justit's really odd and since I have beenpart of the walk away campaign I've hadnothing but positive results my friendslisten did take a hit I will say thatand most of it has been myself because Iknew the people in my community whowould not accept itor who couldn't take it so in that wayI'm still in the closet I'm out gay butI'm not out as a non liberal let's justsay that because I don't think thewalkaway movement is meant to tell youwhat to think or where to go justletting you know that

okay hi I've never done this before butI've been watching this walkawaymovement very very impressed by it so Ithought I'd give my story for what it'sworth my name is Fran I live in NewJersey in a section of New Jersey thatis completely democratic liberal it's aninteresting scenario I always struggledon my life financially and otherwisenever really Democrat or Republican oranything like that but I was caught upin the economic you know try and make iton my own kind of thing when I finallygot to the point where I could afford tohave my own place I probably could haveafforded an area that was morewell-to-do whatever but I didn't want tobelieve it from my mortgage so Ipurchased a condo in a lowermiddle-income area mainly Hispanic andblack known for gangs and not the bestsafety security area anyway long storyshort when I was purchasing my place thebroker that I was working with asked mewhat my political affiliation wasI was like I don't know so he said to mewell you want to register as a Democratyou're in a democratic area and trust meif you register as anything other thanthat your property taxes will be ten totwenty percent higher and you'll have ahard time and you basically won't beable to live a peaceful existence so Iregistered as a Democrat to help insuremy security and safety that in and ofitself says something that's like whatyou mean I don't have a choice if I wantto be safe and secure in the home that Ijust paid for myself that I struggled2530 years to make happen I have to voteand register as a Democrat that didn'tring true to me anyway that being said Ithis is going back like 16 years now andby the way I'm not a spring chicken I'm60 something have grandkids and centeranyway so I'm a business owner smallbusiness I run it myself it pays thebillsI'm not rich by any means but recentlynow we have all this stuff with Trumpand changing the administration removingrestrictions to businesses and all thatkind of stuff tax cuts which is good butone of the things that he did was heimplemented the removal of the Obamacareindividual mandate now I want you toknow that since Obama had implementedthis which by the way he did not dothrough Congress he did at two o'clockin the morning signing an execwater without it going through Congressat all I've been paying $2,500 a yearfor the past three years because of theObama individual mandate because I don'tlike the health care besides which wehave Medicare Medicaid all those thingsthat are already government programs andwhen I looked into Obamacare it was likethis is not good insurance but anywayokay finea

the city that I live in in NewJersey which again is very Democrat hasjust announced that starting next yearthey are going to continue theindividual mandate separate from thefederal government thing so I still haveto pay that money unless of course Imove to a conservative Republican areawhich at my age whatever anyway so Ivote Republican just so you know at thispoint I did vote for Trump because

tothink democrat like you have to thinkall this stuff like you have to uh youknow you have people saying that youknow a vote foruh a vote for this guy is the vote for arepublican is like slaveryyou know i mean you you have peoplesaying all thisqua wild like outlandish stuffyou know what i mean and andso naturally without knowing itwhat happens to you mentally is youbecomeoppressed you become a slave becauseyou're believingyou're believing some people that aretelling you you should think like thisbecause you're blackand when you think about what whitepeople actuallydid to to black people during slaverythat is at the core of what slavery wasyou know you should feel less thanbecause you're blackyou need the government's help you needmy helpbecause you're black because ofthe situation that you're in you seewhat i'm sayingand like but you don't know it becausethey're presentingthemselves to be upright peopleyou know and then they have then on youknow i'm talking about i'm talking aboutliberal news networksthen they have the few black people thatcome in there todaythey probably they always they alwaysare going to hire more black peoplethan the people that they're callingracist

[Music]hey everybody my name is Jessica Parkerand I've been wanting to do this for awhile my puppy is gonna try and get upheresix-month-old giant I don't really knowwhere to startI'm very very very grateful for thisgroup I grew up in a family I'm inOregon that politics were my thing whenI was growing up we went to church myparents taught Sunday School and all thethings and then when I was in fifthgrade they got a divorce and things justkind of unraveled and I ended up beingthe only one going to church after thatso I credit a lot of my life and myhealth whether it be spirituallyemotionally all of itto my faith um because you know myfamily is very dysfunctional as are likemany but as I got older I definitelydefinitely encountered a lot of I wouldcall it bullying from my family my dadand my sister in particular for my faithand I have always been kind of peoplepleaser and tried to keep the peace inmy family and just never spoke up andthen as I went through college I alsowill have to say my mom came from aconservative family my dad came from theliberal family and I didn't really payattention to that until I got older umbut um anyway I went through college Ihave a master's degree and I alwaysreally took pride and not being extremeon one end or the other and just likebeing kind of moderate and seeing thingsfrom both sides I took pride in that butas I got even older my dad became moreextreme and his liberalactive and you know very angry I've seena lot of anger from my dad and my sisterand I'm a twin actually and my sister isa lesbian and you know I'm 43 trying tothink of one she came out it's probablybeen like maybe 10 years and I loveeverybody I take pride in thatI really do I have never ever ever eversaid a main thing I don't even feel ityou know why would I say it and yet I'vebeen I have been labeled and judged forhow she thinks that I believe and thenmy dad as well in terms of my faith andpolitical beliefs even when he was wrongactually because I haven't always votedRepublican I haven't and one year whenbefore I have a 14 year old before hewas bornso 2004 election time and I was rentinga room out of my dad's house and camehome and you know my dad has a drinkingproblem and pretty sure he was a alittle bit drunk and high and he hadbeen on his computer back in the dial-updays and was raging mad and followed mearound the house veins popping out redin the facetoss me up against the wall and was thisclose to me like spitting in my faceabout the election and me votingRepublican and actually I didn't evenknow who I was gonna vote for like hedefinitely had preconceived ideas aboutme obviously because of my faith and henever even bothered to ask me I quicklyescaped to that situation and he didapologize later and anyway all that tosay and my sister and I have not spokefor a while in 2016 when the whole blockmatter thing kind of first came aboutI remember posting I try to like not belike very political or very anything onsocial media but I I posted a picture ofa circle of people black white some copsthey were holding hands in they werepraying I actually made it like my coverphoto I felt like it just spoke volumesand and I know like so many people werehurtinganyway she blasted me on Facebookbecause apparently our ancestors hadslaves like I don't even know and howdare I which it still doesn't make senseto me how dare I whatI'm not sure I immediately locked herand then she texted me nasty things so Iblocked her there she emailed me nastythings blocked her there so she actuallysent me a very nasty letter and saidvery nasty things about my faith and soI've kept it just just as a reminderbecause I tend to you know want toforgive and forget but I every time I'vedone that I'm I paid for itso anyway needless to say all the thingshave really made me more and moreconservative because of I just seen thelight more and more you know I went toOregon State University and I was in ona liberal arts track and then psychologyand my master's is health psychology I'ma health coach and I really startedgoing down a more toxin free living roadand I have mercury amalgams and I havethey think possibly MS and I've I'veconnected the dots there because I had alot of amalgams worked on I'm rightbefore my symptoms really hit and it wasdevastating to me to my life two yearsago and so I've really really taken aroot cause approach to my health eversincea little bit before that and figuringsome things out and noticing things withmy parents and means your medicine andthat actually led me to Trump believe itor not I was sad that he was even up forelection in 2016 I thought it washorrible because I just listened toeverybody else and VIN is but I alsoequally hated Hillary for my own reasonsI mean just anyway I was never I didn'twant to be political because all all thenegatives like hateful things from mydad and my sister um but I I voted forTrump reluctantly lesser of two evilsand then I'm really it's been within thelast year it has really been within thelast year when I've I've really becomeaware of like the mandates that we'refacing started with vaccines and thenall these other things and so definitelywoke me up in huge ways and I wish thatI would have paid attention to politicsa long time agowe're in Oregon I feel like we have adictator you know she has she called aspecial session right now and why whoeven knows she's done nothing for usI have people my neighbor and hasn'treceived checks and might have to move Imean I I know handfuls of people we havenot received our stimulus check andthankfully we're doing fine and I'm notworried about it but there's been somuch in this management in this stateand I already didn't like our governorbecause of really horrible thingshappening with human services andchildren and foster homes and stuff likethat in our state I'm horrible thingsand so anyway I just wish that I hadpaid attention before but I'm sothankful for this group I'm so thankfulit's really easy toget down and get kind of pulled intosome of the negative going on in theworld and I'm so thankful there so manypeople all across the board and I feellike I have friends that like are on thesame page I've definitely lost friendsthroughout this because I've decided tospeak up a little more I try to be verynot neutral but um not divisive either Ireally try hard to do that and notconstantly putting stuff out but I'vedefinitely lost friends who you know I Icount them as not having been truefriends to begin with I really do butI'm not speaking with my dad right nowI'm not speaking even with my mom and mystepdad because they are afraid of drugsthey think he's a dictator and anywayThank You Brandon for this group I am sothankful for it I see everybody'sstories and that

I'm an Davison Sattler I grew up inTexas and becoming an adult thereI made some assumptions when it came tovoting and elections because myinterests were in working with refugeesI wanted to go into crisis managementwhere people going into places wherepeople were fleeing from and I wanted towork with people who were oftenoverlooked in regular society be thathomeless people I would go out and backthen they would collect cans and redeemthem for coins and use use the money tohelp themselves I would work and whatwas called back then halfway houses forpeople who were recently released fromprison and we're trying to return tobeing contributing members of society Ihope so a woman who had recently losther vision as she was adapting to lifeand I taught English because I could seethe economic and educationalopportunities that that would providefor people and I also worked in a UNrefugee camp on the border of Cambodiawhere people were fleeing civil warlosing limbs and family members fromlandmines and violence and to me theywere the epitome of homelessness peoplewithout a home or a homeland to returnto life happened and and interruptionscame and I didn't get to work in thatfield for my entire career and now I'min a lot I'm a lawyer a mom to two youngkids and living in Seattle for the past23 years and I've come to somerealizations even though I still do someof those same things with my time I cometo the realization that I bought aDemocrat based on the assumptions that Ithought that party was one that wantedto help and uplift marginalizedpopulations providing access andopportunity to be heard when theynormally wouldn't be but here in Seattlethat's taking a different turn than whatI have known it to be around 2015 or soI started having to come up withexplanations and answers that wereage-appropriate to my young kidsquestions and basically on a daily basisbecause of what they were observingaround them people were startingto live alongside our roadways and itwould just multiply like every yearthere was more and more and more and thequestions I would have to answer likeyou know why did that man come out thebushes and yell at us and chase us to mykids why can't we touch that shiny thingin the grass which was a needle and whyis that person sleeping on the sidewalkwhen you know we didn't know obviouslyif the person was asleep or passed outbecause we didn't know it was the personthere because they were addicted or werethey there because they were battlingmental illness that was untreated didthey have both but these were thequestions I had to start to address tomy kids because that's the only worldthat they knew was that some people wereliving like this and and they even knewthis wasn't right that something wasvery wrongand that these people clearly neededhelp and yet nothing was being done so Istarted to really question who are thepeople making these decisions becausewe're spending a lot of money on what'sbeen called homelessness and and yet theproblem is it is growing and the dollarsare increasing and there's not reallymuch better indistinct on it noimprovement that's happening in people'slives and in fact in 2015 the City ofSeattle and King County declared a stateof emergency on homelessness and thenthey both quickly just did nothingnothing I mean it's just increased overthat time period and now here we arefive years later and in Kovan nineteenin 2020 and we have people at more riskright there living in these unsanitaryno hygiene access inhumane notcompassionate conditions and when Istarted to come to the realization backin that UN refugee camp that I'd workedin those conditions there were moresanitary hygienic and humane than wewere allowing people to just subsistalong the roadways of Seattle I startedto realize that the Democratic Partythat I knew had started to move so farleft that I didn't recognize it anymoreand as I started to talk about why isthis acceptable why are we spending allthis money and not actually seeingbenefit for people why is this occurringI got a lot of pushback and a lot ofintolerance by established power holdersin the Democratic Party you know that II couldn't ask those questionsand I've even been told that some ofthem preferred that people live in tentsalongside the roadways and not be inFEMA emergency shelter I've come to therealization that I can't be a part ofthat anymore if it means being part ofthat far left the Democrat Party is inSeattle means that you don't you're notgood problem solvers with a lot of taxdollars because that's what's happeningor you don't know your solution and yourapproaches aren't working or you won'tadmit that they won't that they're notworking or you are wanting to capitalizeon the status quo by leaving it and andusing the plight of people to further apolitical purpose I don't want anythingto do with that I find that not onlyunacceptable but it's unconscionable tome I want us to be actually doing goodwork with the tax dollars we areproviding for people that clearly needhelp and then in the midst of all ofthat we have people who can self careand adjusting shelter and they're beingoverlooked and by allowing this tocontinue we have people who want to takeadvantage of it and they're being badactors in the midst of it and so this isnot a way to move forward to pursue apolitical agenda this is a way toalienate people and to shame people andactually be intolerant of saying werequire there to be approaches that areactually workingand not to try to do something else withthe use of the plight of people theywant to demonize business which isreally going to be what we have to youknow carry the we carry our load on aswe exit koban 19 we will need to rely onbusiness to help us come out of thiscrisis that we're in not demonize themand they want to use urban decay in thevisible destruction of the environmentwe spent millions of dollars to restorea creeks habitat right here in Seattleand only to allow a few years laterpeople to camp along that Creek and useit as their toilet and trash can whenwe'd spent millions of dollars torestore the delicate habitat there andnow it's just wasted I don't call thatbeing green I call that being wastefuland I call that not paying attention towhat's going on or not caring or againusing it for a political purpose none ofwhich is acceptable to me so I'velearned that these special type ofDemocrats that are here in charge makingthese decisions in Seattle I just can'tbe a part of that anymoreI require there to be more I want mykids to see a better example of how weproblem solve when we see there's anissue we step forward and we take careof it we don't just leave it and festlet it fester and start to see a waythat we can take advantage of it so Idon't know what they're doing here it itbreaks my heart what they've done to ourcity and they've left me here in themiddle wondering what are they doing andfrankly I don't care what they're tryingto do with it I just know I can't followthem so I've had to walk away and saythat there are other ways and betterways to solve problems and they have tobe done for the better of everybody wecannot allow the quality of life to godown for everyone and people to still beleaning help and the cost to continue torise this is not the way to move forwardwe must evolve asand that means working together and thisis not how it's happening so I've had towalk awayI'm an Davison Sattler I grew up inTexas and becoming an adult thereI made some assumptions when it came tovoting and elections because myinterests were in working with refugeesI wanted to go into crisis managementwhere people going into places wherepeople were fleeing from and I wanted towork with people who were oftenoverlooked in regular society be

civil warlosing limbs and family members fromlandmines and violence and to me theywere the epitome of homelessness peoplewithout a home or a homeland to returnto life happened and and interruptionscame and I didn't get to work in thatfield for my entire career and now I'min a lot I'm a lawyer a mom to two youngkids and living in Seattle for the past23 years and I've come to somerealizations even though I still do someof those same things with my time I cometo the realization that I bought aDemocrat based on the assumptions that Ithought that party was one that wantedto help and uplift marginalizedpopulations providing access andopportunity to be heard when theynormally wouldn't be but here in Seattlethat's taking a different turn than whatI have known it to be around 2015 or soI started having to come up withexplanations and answers that wereage-appropriate to my young kidsquestions and basically on a daily basisbecause of what they were observingaround them people were startingto live alongside our roadways and itwould just multiply like every yearthere was more and more and more and thequestions I would have to answer likeyou know why did that man come out thebushes and yell at us and chase us to mykids why can't we touch that shiny thingin the grass which was a needle and whyis that person sleeping on the sidewalkwhen you know we didn't know obviouslyif the person was asleep or passed outbecause we didn't know it was the personthere because they were addicted or werethey there because they were battlingmental illness that was untreated didthey have both but these were thequestions I had to start to address tomy kids because that's the only worldthat they knew was that some people wereliving like this and and they even knewthis wasn't right that something wasvery wrongand that these people clearly neededhelp and yet nothing was being done so Istarted to really question who are thepeople making these decisions becausewe're spending a lot of money on what'sbeen called homelessness and and yet theproblem is it is growing and the dollarsare increasing and there's not reallymuch better indistinct on it noimprovement that's happening in people'slives and in fact in 2015 the City ofSeattle and King County declared a stateof emergency on homelessness and thenthey both quickly just did nothingnothing I mean it's just increased overthat time period and now here we arefive years later and in Kovan nineteenin 2020 and we have people at more riskright there living in these unsanitaryno hygiene access inhumane notcompassionate conditions and when Istarted to come to the realization backin that UN refugee camp that I'd workedin those conditions there were moresanitary hygienic and humane than wewere allowing people to just subsistalong the roadways of Seattle I startedto realize that the Democratic Partythat I knew had started to move so farleft that I didn't recognize it anymoreand as I started to talk about why isthis acceptable why are we spending allthis money and not actually seeingbenefit for people why is this occurringI got a lot of pushback and a lot ofintolerance by established power holdersin the Democratic Party you know that II couldn't ask those questionsand I've even been told that some ofthem preferred that people live in tentsalongside the roadways and not be inFEMA emergency shelter I've come to therealization that I can't be a part ofthat anymore if it means being part ofthat far left the Democrat Party is inSeattle means that you don't you're notgood problem solvers with a lot of taxdollars because that's what's happeningor you don't know your solution and yourapproaches aren't working or you won'tadmit that they won't that they're notworking or you are wanting to capitalizeon the status quo by leaving it and andusing the plight of people to further apolitical purpose I don't want anythingto do with that I find that not onlyunacceptable but it's unconscionable tome I want us to be actually doing goodwork with the tax dollars we areproviding for people that clearly needhelp and then in the midst of all ofthat we have people who can self careand adjusting shelter and they're beingoverlooked and by allowing this tocontinue we have people who want to takeadvantage of it and they're being badactors in the midst of it and so this isnot a way to move forward to pursue apolitical agenda this is a way toalienate people and to shame people andactually be intolerant of saying werequire there to be approaches that areactually workingand not to try to do something else withthe use of the plight of people theywant to demonize business which isreally going to be what we have to youknow carry the we carry our load on aswe exit koban 19 we will need to rely onbusiness to help us come out of thiscrisis that we're in not demonize themand they want to use urban decay in thevisible destruction of the environmentwe spent millions of dollars to restorea creeks habitat right here in Seattleand only to allow a few years laterpeople to camp along that Creek and useit as their toilet and trash can whenwe'd spent millions of dollars torestore the delicate habitat there andnow it's just wasted I don't call thatbeing green I call that being wastefuland I call that not paying attention towhat's going on or not caring or againusing it for a political purpose none ofwhich is acceptable to me so I'velearned that these special type ofDemocrats that are here in charge makingthese decisions in Seattle I just can'tbe a part of that anymoreI require there to be more I want mykids to see a better example of how weproblem solve when we see there's anissue we step forward and we take careof it we don't just leave it and festlet it fester and start to see a waythat we can take advantage of it so Idon't know what they're doing here it itbreaks my heart what they've done to ourcity and they've left me here in themiddle wondering what are they doing andfrankly I don't care what they're tryingto do with it I just know I can't followthem so I've had to walk away and saythat there are other ways and betterways to solve problems and they have tobe done for the better of everybody wecannot allow the quality of life to godown for everyone and people to still beleaning help and the cost to continue torise this is not the way to move forwardwe must evolve asand that means working together and thisis not how it's happening so I've had towalk away
[Music]my walkaway story is more of a stay awaystory you know as a kid I was we weretaught about politics you know at thetime I was in elementary school andClinton was elected and you know socialstudies class they told us they taughtus what they could about politics theDemocrats Republicans and even back thenand I don't remember ever seeing one hasworse than the other I never seen a goodguy in bag I just saw two parties whowanted the same goal for to you knowlead the country make sure everythingwas going great they just had differentways of implementing that the from thento this day I see the Democrats as thehip party you know they were alwaysyounger and there of course progressivewhich isn't a bad thing but now it'sbeen sullied but in its general meaningit isn't a bad thing because you get newideas and you know things like that butnow when you when I looked at theRepublicans never saw them as bad guys Ijust said to myself well these guys arekind of you know they're the squareparty you know they're always older maleand most of the time those that we spokeabout God and protecting a countrymilitary that's what you think but youdon't think evil and ever thought evilneither party and I never thought ofeither that wayand now I'm gonna fast forward a bit tothe state of bush-era now that was thefirst time I ever really thought aboutpolitics it's like really consumed mymind and said what is going on herebecause this guy he seemed you know youseem let's say he looked like he wasjust there for the mic you know he wouldspeak on the mic while the rest of theadministration were pulling the stringstelling him what to say that's how I sawthat's how he came off to me and that'swhen I started look at the party as awhole and I was like you guys got to dobetter than that you know but stillnever thought there was never I neverthought of the party as a problem wasthe individual if the president did goodhe represented this party but at thesame time didn't good for all for all ofus so then comes President Obama youknow I voted for him and a reason behindthat was because coming off a bush I wassaying to myself yeah I do seepresidents first before the party butwhat we had lined up didn't really youknow during Obama's campaign didn't itdidn't sit well with me and on top ofhim potentially becoming the first blackpresident and apart fromis weak i call this word e'en way ofspeaking his cadence is i guess theycall it swag swagger you know he hadgood ideas and I like that okayokay I'm like what I like what I'mhearing especially coming up from beinga senator from Chicago and knowing this[ __ ] that's a go that goes down overthere I'm like yeah he's got somethingto say and he's gonna make a change forthis you know hence the slogan you knowchange you can believe in so I was likeyeah this is a guy this is the guythat's why I voted for him and it'llbeing disappointed you know cuz afterall those years nothing's really changednothing you promised changed i I've onlyI was proud of him for I know one forsure I thought there was another one yaknow it was justI'm only proud of the fact that he gotOsama bin Laden finally but that was atthe end suddenly after that I was aswell that's it well you did somethingalright but really and truly the waythings are going now you we needsomebody that's gonna do a lot more thanthat one thing now mind you I am NOTignorant of him being stopped at everyturn when he when he would propose acertain change butonce he got that no it was like he gaveup it's like hey I got an idea let's dosomething about um you know unemploymentand the crime going on in Chicago youjust say it never stayed on it only timehe put the energy into doing somethingwas for was for homosexuals for the gayequality and marriage and all that stuffand I'm like okay can I'm glad you diditI personally I don't see why well whywould you focus on that with so muchenergy and not the things that that'sactually affecting the country becauseI'm gonna tell you this you want anelection a lot of the people that votedfor you are progressive Democrats youthink you need to put that all thatenergy into gay marriage I think we'reall behind you on that one so you knowand use this oppose all of it it is thatwas all people to talk about that wasall wouldn't you think about it that'sall they they could say he did you knowI have no problem with it but the energybehind it you know it's kind of suspectthat you focused on that and not us notthe rest of the people you know you gota priorities had never seen it nevercease always and he just laugh it offthis we used to get me mad look he'ssmiling you know crack a joke and youknow at least now with Trump he smiles acrack a joke and get it gets it done sohe's burned that he's earned that smirkhe's earned that joke but this guy manhe didn't and I'm sorry to say I wastedmy first vote you knowI wasted my second want to but I'm justsaying when somebody feel full and someperson you voted for wind and nothinggets done especially the things that areimportant so yeah but let's let's getback on track to walk away so there aretwo things there's TDS Trump derangementsyndrome and then there's the opening ofthe eyes the awakening people areopening their eyes people are doingresearch because people this guyPresident Trump he's caused people tolook into things read into things doesremember before he was elected duringhis campaign people started to look intohim I want to tell you this in thebeginning I didn't he's already knew whohe wasn't I knew as much as thateverybody else did and I said to myselfI don't think he's presidential at allso I said I don't think I want him towin let the professionals do itbounce my mindset in the beginning andthen we saw the other candidates andthen we saw Hillary Clinton and I waslike yeah first of all I didn't want herto win when she was going against BarackObama okayand nowgoing now okay this is where the youknow I know people are tired of hearingit but the lesser of two evils thingcomes in if it had to be somebody orrather somebody without experience torun the country then somebody is corruptas Hillary you know so that's where Istood and back to the awakening thingwhen it was getting close you knows nowring down to them and right then andthere once Bernie got screwed overbecause I was I was actually planning onvoting for Bernie you know he got me afree college I'm sorry but once he gotscrewed over by the DNC and I was likenah this is wickedness right here I saidto myself you know what do you researchlet's check this guy outlet's really check this guy because youknow there's a chance this one thiswoman might win and I'm sick of the theconflicts overseas in the Middle Eastand the dealings and after what happenedto Haiti who knows what the future willhold if there's a well they can't say ifwhen it comes to a natural disasterthose things happen imagine the eventthat she will take over any othercountry or state or anything like thatimagine her and her cronies stealing themoney just like she did it with Haitipromise is broken over and over so Isaid okay if this guy is gonna win letme see let me let me see that we're notdoomed either way so that's when Istarted to look him up and that's when Ifound all the videos of him on OprahLetterman all these shows talking aboutthe samedamn things albeit he spoke mostly onfinances and stuff like that whichwouldn't you think about it he do wemake good on our finances firsteverything else will followbecause it's when your money's [ __ ] upit becomes the root of all evil becauseif you don't have it you obsess over itthat's why crime happens that's whythere's he's under you know under thetable dealings that's why companies cutcorners all these things that he earnedme a point and what he earned points andwhen you see those speeches like he'sdisguise passionate about this countrybecause he does want to see it becomebetter because he comes from a timewhere it was better and he saw it slowlyyou know getting worse so he jumped atthe chance because remember he was askedover and over to me it was suggested andasked maybe you should run you everthink about running and mind you peopleheard what he saidagreed it's this guy nice dude this guyneeds to run because these issues he'stalking about I damn well agree pleaserun do you consider running no no no ifI did win I'll do anything I canitem then he started talking [ __ ] aboutRepublicans and now they're super votersblah blah blahthis guy will pull out all stops to winand he wants to win and if you payattention him winning it's not himwinning it's us winning because it's ourissues he was speaking of you know whenI'm looking at those things I'll sayokay but in my mind he wasn't idealbecause I still didn't see him aspresidential which is a mistake on mypart because I did not vote for himalthough I said it I voted for a JillStein so I said if she doesn't win andshe had pretty good ideas you know plusshe's our belief she was a scientist andyou know anybody with a mind like thatwill want to solve problems so I figuredlet's go let's go outside of theleft/right realm and just Green Partylet's let's try it out let's trysomething new maybe something you willwork that's why I voted for her I saidif she doesn't win please jump pleaseyou win you win eventually he did andthat's when the [ __ ] started once hewon day one in the office CNN claims heremoved the MLK bust from from the OvalOffice and I'm I was like this motherdid he just retreat oh they got me for asecond I looked it up false I said it'sover you're still going I'd understandme you know you I don't understand ifhe'll still it feels during the electionthey pulling out all stops cuz theydon't like him all all although I seethat as wrong for the media to dobecause media should not be biased inany way if they are biased they shouldshut up and just report the news but Istill have the understanding of at leastif he was still running you pull that[ __ ] he's won let's let's be done lethim do his jobif you if he [ __ ] up its his shoe goingin his mouth we can impeach we have termlimits for presidents relax let thingsflow they couldn't they couldn't tdsthat's where it brings me to trumpderangement syndrome because it's didn'tstop it did not stop it's still goingstrong although right now I'm going tosay especially right with uh with thewalkaway movement it's overfor these crazy leftist is over becauseall they have is you can scream all dayall they want enough that's gonna changefor them they're just gonna be miserablewhile the rest of the country is winningand I'm gonna say this I am NOT aRepublican I will always be anindependent so still hoping he wins in2020 Donald Trump but after that I don'tcare what party you're in but if yourplans don't match up to this guy rightnow if it doesn't match up horse or yourcampaign promises does not exceed hisyou know I don't care what party areayou're in you have to do that you haveto surpass what he's doing because thisis the first time in a very long timebecause after what Trump is doing rightnow it his constant winning has methinking of the past presidents that Iwas alive to witness and say there wasno excuse for the [ __ ] that's beengoing on there is no excuse that nothingwas able to change in each of thosepresidents terms or multiple terms therewas no reason for that he's put them toshame so the next guy after him or nextgal after him they really they got astep big game up and hey you know whatI'm even hoping for I'm hoping that hedoes so good that it doesn't even matterwho else comes in country's fixed theyjust have to sit in that seat and makesure we're protected make sure you guysget him paid make sure you just sit backand do your job just chill just chilluntil you're called upon I'm at leasthoping for that because I'm sick of thismedia frenzy I'm sick of the legacymedia just [ __ ] things out of nowherewith oh my god the immigration and likeyo how much I'm a child of immigrantsokay so it gets on my nerves when peoplecall me or people like me you knowracists and things like that just for myopinion especially especially onimmigration I'm like yo you think it'sfair that both my parents came here andworked hard to work their asses off andlegally became citizens of the UnitedStates and made sure that I followedthat gritjust to have somebody sneak over andjump in line because I had that problemwhen I was looking for a job looking forjobs you know it was either this one Iunderstand was either because I wasn't astudent and when you're competing withstudents for a job they're not gonnahire somebody who's overqualified likeme that's more understandable but whenI'm a citizen and I have a resume toprove prove the skills that I have andthis somebody just comes over the boardand sneaks here and able to do that nownah man it's that's not okay it's notokay and right I'm gonna I'm gonna saythis you cannot put any of this bountnot even blame Barack Obama for what hedid with the with the immigrants youcan't blame this country at all for theimmigration laws I don't care I reallydon't care cuz really and truly yougotta you gotta solve the problem fromthe root the root is we'll have acountry that coming from that's what yougotta focus your attention to all theillegal immigrants focus your attentionon where you come from because it'sfunny how you're running away from allthe [ __ ] are you going on over there youget you come here you curse thepresident for doing his job and doingwhat the people wanted and trying toprotect this people will protect you ifyou're at least become a citizen get youyou wave your flag I thought you wererunning I thought you didn't like whereyou came from I thought what happened Ithought you came here illegally makingmoney sent back so they could come hereat least that's the only good thing youdo and when you send the money back theycan come here legally right but don'tthough you don't start waving your flagat people's faces when you knew you ranaway that yeahthat's your right therejust it just makes me one happen like yoyou you done you you're not winning thisfight because it makes no sense I agreethat immigration should change they needtheir immigration laws to change I don'tmean I don't mean the wall that wallshould go up I don't mean securitySecurity's fine to memaybe just needs more security butreally and truly what I think the pathto citizenship should be strengthenedyou know I think there should be moreincentive there should be sure to waittime should be sponsor stuff like thatjust to you know rush to you know theapplication processes things like thatbut other than that man don't come herewith that [ __ ] I had we havegenerations of ever in this country hasgenerations of immigrants who came hereillegally or legally and still becamecitizens and worked their asses off andyes they made this country great you seeme disagreeing with that immigrants madethis country great even illegalimmigrants who at least when they wereillegal found the way to become legaland work their asses off so don't comehere feeding off of us don't do that youcan't get mad if we retaliate againstthat you know I know all the all ourhard-working butit's still a crime to sneak over if youget caught you got caught either youneed to try again or try the right waybecause nobody's saying you can't comeback they might put a limit to you knowhow long it can be before you even tryagain but that's punishment you dosomething wrong you get punished that'ssimple but yeah man so yeah this is whyit's okay so I'm getting off topic sothis is why this is why it's a stay-awaybecause yo did after what's been goingon recently this like I said thisawakening has caused me to do moreresearch and in this research I come onyou find out that the Democratic Partywas the party of the KKK they were theparty that started the gun control lawswhich were initially started to keepblack people from owning guns and notonly that if you had a specific gun likewas it called Saturday night specialsback in the day of the Black Pantherdoesn't stuff like that they didn't wantthat they did not want that and when youthink about itthese powerful black men Martin LutherKing Malcolm X and others Republicansdon't mean I'm a Republican and I havemy reasons for now cuz I don't I don'twant to contain greatness to a party youknow but when you look at it you likewhoa this partythis person is of this party so it makessense it's it's basically over right nowfor the Democrats right I'm at a pointwhere I'm like walk away it's over we'veonly had a couple of Democraticpresidents that kicked ass you knowRoosevelt and I'm talking with Teddy JFKmaybe Carter and you know Robert Kennedyand then who else can you really thinkof everyone else who kicked ass forRepublicans who said to say it's freeRepublicans who fought against all ofthat Democrats so you want things to getbetter you want this country to win youwalk away straight up and down and walkaway this is straight [ __ ] what'sgoing on what y'all are doing

sayingstay away straight up-and-down peace[Music][Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]
helloeveryone my name is bloomand i'm here today because i wanted tobe open about my walk away experienceum if you hear anything in thebackground it's my little baby my dogalchemy sowhere to even begin um it i feel likethere's so manylayers that go with thisthere's so many umthere's so many things thatare involved with where i am today how ifeelmy political views and different thingslike thatum i would saythat i that fear kept mefrom really being vocal about how i feelabout um umpolitics um and and justvarious things becausetoday it seems like when you uhdon't agree with the majornarratives that are going around uh itseemsthat you get attacked for what youbelieveum and so it took me a while for me toget to this placebecause the fear of rejection the fearofpeople not wanting to be my friendanymore the fear of peoplehaving something to say about what i'mdoingum but i decided to push past thatuh and to be vocal aboutwhat i believe sothis journey has been a longjourney it's been a very spiritualjourney for me and that isreally what started this it's been adomino effectit's just been one thing after anotherthat hasreallygot me to where i am today uh with thisjourneyum so for my spiritual journey itstarted withmy spiritual teachers andthey teach a lot about you having thepower and you not having to bea victim to any circumstance to any toanythingum and you are you are sovereignand you havecomplete power over your mind you havedominion over yourself over your sphereum and that really stuck with methey also talked about you know there'sno heroes no villains there's no youversus themum and that really stuck with me becauseumthat has been such a big part of myidentityum especially being a african americanbut especially being an african-americanwomanmy identity was very enmeshedum with a lot of us versus themand so i started to begin to see thedistortions in my own thinkingi started stepping out of that paradigmand started just seeing myselfas a being and not a blackfemale so that wasi would say one of the first awakeningsthatbrought me to this umso walking away uh so thenum thenmy best friend she had sent me a candicei won this videoi never heard of her never knew thisnever heard this woman's name everand she sent me a video and i washooked after that i was like whois this woman like sheis unapologetic about what she believesit's likeyou have no you haven't i mean how canyou not respect her becauseshe's gonna say how she feels regardlessof what anyonethinks about what she's doingum not only that but the things that shewas sayingreally resonated with me a lot of thethings that she says aboutthe black community umit really it really resonated with mebecause like i said again on thatspiritual journey i was reallyseparating myself from thisus versus them mentality um i wasi was really doing a lot of metaphysicalworkmental work as far astraining my mind and understanding thati create my realityand knowing that the things that i speakabout and i focus on umwill become my reality i mean soa lot like i said a lot of the thingsthat kenneth owens was sayingwas really resonating with me umabout different things such asum the violence in our communities umthe different things such aslike the umthe two parent homes just a lot ofdifferent things that she was sayingum was just really really resonatingwith meum and so she was urging like in a lotof her videos she urgesyou to i mean do your own research youknow and soi started to do a lot of researchabout um the democratic partybecause i've always proclaimed myself tobe you know a democrata liberal you know not really knowingwhat those things mean not reallyunderstandingum the historywith you know within those politicalsystems and different things like thatand some voting for obama twicewithout knowing anything about hispolicieswithout knowing anything about you knowhis plans for the black community i meananything like i just was like oh my goshthis is a black man he'she's running for president how can i nothelp this brotherin you know so me blindlyum voting for this man and not reallyum seeing if what he wanted to implementaligned with my valuesand so you know me doing researchi started researching the democraticparty i startedwatching lectures from dr thomas soulewalter williams and shelby steeleand i just really i what i wasdiscovering was mind-blowing umand i saw a lotof distortion i saw a lot of distortionwhereasi was my i was literally mind blownbecausewhat they were saying made completesense to meit made 100 sense to meand then when i started doing the theresearch about the history of thedemocratic partyand you know umand also the republican party andunderstandingthat the republican party was the reallythe first party of the black peopleum and knowing that the democratic partyhad very close ties to the creation ofthe kkkyou know they were the ones who umimplemented those jim crow laws and soit justreally really made me thinklike whoa this is crazyso then um i started you knowresearching uh conservatism andunderstanding what that meantand and realizing that a lot of thoseprinciples ummatched with my principles and my valuesand you knowi was just mind-blown i was like wowlike i've had all of these values forthe most partalmost all of my life and this is thefirst time that i'm really having anencounterwith these ideals so it was it wasreallylike eye-opening you know um so theni started doing research about trumpand i know that name just it justchills up people's spines umi started doing my research about trumpandum i was on the trump train toolike i was when he first you know waswhen i first found out that he wascampaigning i was like what the hellexcuse my language but i was just likewhat is going on like i mean i was justsayingcrazy stuff like saying somebody neededto assassinate him like it was justi mean i was on the train too and ididn't even know why you know lookingback i didn't know whyi didn't know why i felt that wayeverybody felt that way soi was just on the bandwagon witheveryone elseright and soi mean everybody was just i mean justall of the narratives that he'sracist that just all of this and thatand soi decided to look for myselfum so you know i would see articles onfacebookand you know social media in general andi started looking at his speeches formyselfand started noticing that a lot of themainstream media was verybiased about the informationwhen it came to uhpresident trump for in for examplelike when it was so many memes that cameout when he was talking about thedisinfectants for like covet and stufflike that like you were like oh he toldus to drink bleachand i was like what so i went back andlistened to hishis press conference or his speech andhe didn't say anythinglike that so it just started reallygetting me todig deeper you know and i just startedrealizing that a lot of the things thatwere beingpushed out there into the mainstreammedia uhwas absolutely false andit just blew my mind it just blew mymindum completely blew my mindand you know trump said thathe told black people um that he said youknow your schools are failingyou you know umyour employment rates are lowi mean just so many different things andhe said what do you have to loseyou know and a lot of people took thatas a negative thinguh whereas you have you knowall these cities these major cities suchas you know likebaltimore detroit chicago all of thesemajor cities who are democratic citiesbut have a highuh black population how those you knowcities are failingdrastically educationally you know witha crime and just so manyand so it just it just it just made methink likeyou know we've given these peoplemultiple chances and i was willing totry something different you know we'vewe've givencareer politicians such as biden who'sbeen in officefor 47 plus years or however many yearshe's been in office don't quote mewe've given these people opportunityafter opportunityto to better our communities andnothing has nothing has changed and sowhy not give you knowsomeone else an opportunity toto see what they have you know plannedum and i feel like so farhe's done a pretty good job umyou know i i went to hbcu and so thefact that he was ableto do something about the permanentfunding for that that was big for meyou know um the opportunity zones i meanthe prison reform i mean it's just a lotof so many different things thatum that president trump has been doingum and so i don't seewhat what there is to lose um and so itook that red pilland i've been i've been onyou know this journey this walk awayjourneyand i've been enjoying that freedomum i recently got to go to a blessedeventit was phenomenal okay i've met some ofthe mostamazing people um at this eventthey were amazing i mean it was sucha wonderful experience like it wasamazingi'm gonna do another video about myblackstone experience becauseit was just i i mean it was you had tohave been therelike i got to meet officer tatumi got to meet abl if you don't know someof these people you definitely shouldcheck them outum they keep it real with you you mightbe triggered with the things that theysaybut they keep it very real uh i got totake a picture with abl i got to take apicture with officer tatumi got to take a picture with candiceowens my girlum so i meani feel free i feel very free i feellike a free thinker i feel like a freethinker um i feeli feel very grateful to be able to be tobe able tohave my own opinion and to not beconsumed by group thinkand not trauma bonding anymore withthe black community um because i don'ti no longer look at myself as a victimi no longer look at um someonewho is looking externally for someone toto um to value me and to see my worth asa humanum which is i mean it's soliberating it's so soliberating um like i said before umi used to think that every white personwasyou know having a problem with me i usedto go into situations with that mindsetbecause ialways was thinking about race like itwas just soi mean i you know i i needed to blackthis i needed a black doctor i neededthis inum and my mind was just so focused onracethat i couldn't see that i wasn't ableto see people for who theywere um i mean it was to the point wherewhen i was the interracial couple i meani would feel some type of wayyou know like it just consumed me thesethesenarratives these ideals and then when iput those burdens down i was able to befree and i was able to love everyoneand to notsee people just for theirfor their race you knowum but like i said it's been reallyliberatingum and i walked away i walked awayand i got rejected by so many people uhwhen i went tothat blessed event i mean i got so muchbacklashi mean so many people people who ithought i was cool with were inboxing mebeing disrespectful people were sadabout it i meanit was i mean nobody people some peoplewanted to dialogue and ask me questionsand i genuinely appreciated thatuh but a lot of people were just verylikeand that also made me you know thinklikewow people are upset at me forhaving my own opinion and having my ownthoughts something's not right hereso i urge you all to just really do yourresearchto really separate your emotionsum from things because when i was veryemotional about things that's howum that's how i got really swept upi'm inspired into that other mindsetbut when i decided to take myemotions out of things and to really domy ownresearch and to really seek for myselfum it was extremely liberating sothis is bloom and again this is my walkaway story and i'm so happy to be hereand i'm so happy i took that red pillpeaceyou

hi walk away campaign this is mytestimony my walk away video my name isPhyllis I am NOT a Russian bot but myparents were my parents werecard-carrying members of the CommunistParty USA beginning in the 30s and as asproof I have some information about themI was raised in Boston in the inner-cityRoxburythis is information that was kept aboutcommunists in the local newspaper it'snow the Boston Herald and I stole thesefrom their archives back in the 1960s sothis is my my father's information andthis was my mother's the MassachusettsRed List inside there are articles aboutthem their backgrounds education soforth and they're supportive activitiesthey were both summoned to appear beforea special Commission in Massachusetts tostudy and investigate communism andsubversive activities and relatedmatters so this was some summons that mymother received to appear before theCommission my father also appeared andthey pled the fifth which means thatthey refused to testify againstthemselves which is a right in theConstitution so Elementary School was alot of politics and my sister and I usedto hand out leaflets at the pollingplaces which is now illegal so I'vealways been a politics junkie my wholelife and then in in early 1960s when Ientered junior high high schoolwe moved to Newton Massachusetts myparents moved us there because of theexcellent schoolssystem which meant that there werecommunists social studies teachersNewton was and still is a hotbed of realradical left activity there were somepeople that live there very famouspeople that you and you would recognizetheir names and their kids went toschool with me and that was a crowd thatI hung out with we had a SDS groupstudents for Democrats Society we werevery much into anti-war the anti-vietnamwar civil rights women's liberation andall of that stuff I was totally into ita hundred percent voted Democrat ahundred percent back then the voting agewas 21 so I didn't vote until I got tocollege but it was always it wasstraight Democrat when I did high schoolwas very tumultuous in the 1960s itwasn't great it wasn't great at all andI smoked pot every single day of mysenior year in high school just just soI could make it through and graduatewhich I did and I was able to get intocollegeso and by the way when we moved toNewton my parents left the CommunistParty USA because it was imploding andthat's another story and theytransitioned seamlessly into theDemocrat Party as most of their friendsdid why they didn't stay with a moreradical alternative I'm not sure a likePeace and Freedom Party but anyway theydecided to become Democrats we werebecoming more middle-class so thanks tocapitalism by the way and so that wasstill the mill year that I moved aroundin so I went off to to college and itwas just more of the same more likecommunist professors I took all thewomen'sstudies classes marched on the Pentagonand at one point I lived in a women'scommune this was off of Harvard Squarein Cambridge Mass we lived in a woman'scommune we did not let men into thehouse not even a male cat could comeinto our house and I had a boyfriendacross channel so I had to go over thereif I wanted to see him so in and out ofcollege did graduate and decided to moveclear across the country to pursue mydream so I moved to California where Iam now and a half Ben's since 1974 solife was rough at first I had asubstance abuse problem and my moralcompass was way off so I got intotrouble and I ended up in a 12-stepprogram where I started to seek God andeventually in 1981 I accepted JesusChrist as my Lord and Savior I was a newcreation a new person my life changedand I changed completelyand my worldview changed dramatically180 degrees in the other direction and Iended up turning away from liberalismDemocrat Party and that whole philosophywhich had been the so the ideology thecommunist ideology that really wasingrained in me and burned in my heartwere there really four principles numberone there is no God people who believein God are stupid and weak number twoman is God he's capable of perfectionand thus establishing a utopians utopiansociety there is no authority higherthan man except the government of coursenumber three everyone is a victim thepoor are victims of the rich women arevictims of men blacks our victimof white and on and on and number fourthat the rich are the most evil peoplein the world that's my father ragingagainst the rich the rich the rich Iwill never forget that as long as I liveso these pillars these truths ofcommunism were completely or completelywrong so number one I was taught thereis no God and if you're believing Godyou're stupid and weak well the fact isthere is indeed a creator god he doesexist that man has to answer to and bein obey and in Psalm 14:1 States thefool says in his heart there is no Godso who is the fool who is the fool herethe Atheist with a believer um man cannever be perfectonly God is perfect and man willcontinue to sin until the day that hedies which is why we need Jesus by theway so a worker's paradise can never becreative paradise can never be createdon earth because man will continue to goastray and he will ultimately let act inhis own best self-interest you cannotchange human nature it's just that's theway it is and this was a very importantprinciple that I learned God created usin his own image with free will this isvery key because with the idea of freewill comes the idea of personalresponsibility responsibility now thatwas a very new concept for me because Iguess I just blamed everybody else formy problems and in Christianity there isno there was no victimhoodwhen you're a Christian you have adirect relationship with God he owns youno one elsecan own you so regardless of yourcircumstances you are free and you areyou're in God's hand he owns you hedirects your paths so listen and listento this listen to this in from Galatians3:28 there is no longer Jew or Gentileslave or free male and female for youare all one in Christ Jesusthat's God's utopia right thereI also rejected the demon ationdemonization of the rich and like I saidI think capitalism is the best way tocreate a middle class there will alwaysbe the poor there will always behopefully a middle class which mostpeople will be in and there will alwaysbe the rich who serve a wonderfulpurpose in paying taxes for a lot ofthings that us poor middle class peoplecan take advantage of so I think thelast Democrat I voted for was WalterMondale and in 1984 and since then I'vepretty much been I've been Republicannow one other thing I just want to talkabout some contrast between liberalismand conservatism some of the ideologicalcontrasts and and one of the things inconservatism that we know is thatequality does not equal sameness incommunist utopia I was taught there isno income inequality because everyonewill earn the same amount of moneyregardless of what profession you're inlook it up income inequality does notexist conservatism values the individualindividual freedom individual libertyindividual achievementwe believe in equality of opportunitynot equality of outcome not everyone

thatequality does not equal sameness incommunist utopia I was taught there isno income inequality because everyonewill earn the same amount of moneyregardless of what profession you're inlook it up income inequality does notexist conservatism values the individualindividual freedom individual libertyindividual achievementwe believe in equality of opportunitynot equality of outcome not everyone isthe same not everyone can get intoHarvard not everyone can afford alone tobuy a house so there's there's of courseI could go on and on and on but that'sthat's enough that's my story I'msticking to it and have a great daypeace love you allyou
ohhi everyone uh my name is alan i justwant to take this timeuh staying at home because of thecoronavirusto share my walkway story so hopefullyeveryone's washing our hands andwearing masks and keeping the socialdistancing becauseuh once we get through with this viruswe can get back out there and win theelection this time souh coming again just to share with youthathow i walked away from the party i oncelovedand associate myself with uh first ofall i'mactually one of the guys who would havevote obama twiceuh i would say would have because bothin 2008and 2012 i was having a job in china imean i came backto the us in 2009 then went to chinaagainin 2012. um so i mean i i actually wentto the u.sembassy in shanghai and uh i was like iwant to vote for obamaand they were like you have to pay likei don't knowlike something like 200 dollars whichwas likeyeah i i don't want to pay that much sobut i was so excited to vote for thisguyi was so excited to listen to all of hisspeechesi just found him to be so inspirationali mean i remember back in thein those years every time i just want tolisten to obama's speechesagain and again and again i felt thatwas just soinspirational and what hewas probably still is a good speakerso and uh i just love his wordsand because at the time i associatemyselfwith all these values like i'mopen-mindedi love equality i like to empower womeni like to you know have open trade withthefree trade with other countries andi was like if i'm for all these things ihave to vote democrats becauseaccording to cnn and washington post andnew york timesthat's how you're supposed to be andwhichi actually read new york times andwatched cnna lot uh didn't watch fox news at thetimei don't think so i mean i i guess iwasn't running away from it but i didn'treally watch it i wasmostly just watching cnn at the timeso with that being said and what made mewant to walk away in 2016 actually iwalked awayalmost four years ago is because istarted to have questions i do have thisuhvalue or i do have this way ofthinking things i keep challenging thestatus quo i keepchallenging my own belief systems ialways want to try tolisten to the other side uh so thenit all actually started when i wastraveling in taiwan so ii met this taiwanese guy and uh he wasuh just we were chatting andwe were talking about the war on isisand he was saying that you knowthe us is probably helping the isis iwas like you gotta be kidding me it'slikewho's crazy enough to say that rightand he was asking me a question sayingheydo you think the us has the strongestmilitary force in the world i would sayof course of course we're the best we'renumber oneright angles like you know ice ispretty weak compared to the us militarywhite sothen uh i was like yeah of courseuh now he goes like how come the moreyou fight isis the strongerisis gets if it's not because obama ishelping themhow would you explain it so at the timei still thought he was bsingbut it got me started to think so thenstarted doing some more researches andwhile i was working in china i noticed afew things thatobama let me down so it got me thinkinglike one of the thingsi remember obama said in a speech wassaying that heywe are the ones to make the rules in theglobal trade we should not let chinamake the ruleswe should be the ones to make the rulesso it i was expecting him to be tougheron china buthe wasn't he was only talking and hedidn't do anything with chinato like you know regulate them oryou know to make them stop stealing ourtechnology so he didn't do any of thatand even in the paris accord i washoping that he wouldat least you know stop china frompolluting the earthbut he did not do that he allowed chinato increase pollutionuntil 2030 which is not having them tostoppolluting by 2030s like they canramp up their pollution levels everyyearuntil 2030 they just don't increasetheirpollution by 2030 which is they just golikewhat it's like you said you would betough on china butyou weren't so uh thenafter that i started to do more and moreresearch likeuh later on i found out that under obamathe reason thatour military was not so strong inconflict like in fighting isis a part ofthe reasons a lota lot of high commanding officers theircommanding powers werestripped away uh by obama because a lotof the actions likewhen you're out in the field when youneed to havesome operations you have to get approvalfrom the white houseto to it's a go or not don't go butusually to me that doesn't make sensebecause if the president's notthere not knowing what the situation isnot knowing where the enemy abouts orthe situation awarenesshow is he gonna make the best ofjudgment right it's people on the groundknowing what's best to do right it'scommon sensei think he's who was doing the politicalcorrectness thing tomake sure that he makes the final calland so awakened a lot of generalspositions or powers and to me thatdidn't make senseand definitely their brand new cleardeal got me thinkinglike why the heck do you do that itdoesn't make sense it makesit gives iran a lot more powerand another time i saw on the news thatlike we lost like 200 like 2000some hundies to isisfor some reason it's like how thathappened likeeven in world war ii when we werefighting nazis and japanesewe never lost that many vehicles it'slike it doesn't make sense unless if youjust like purposely give them awayand uh another one oh this one reallypissed me offremember that deserter in iraqor afghanistan forget hedeserved his post and then somehow hegot captured by isisand obama used five senior isis leadersto switch him backlike swap him back remember that i meanwhy redness like what who would dothat it's like i mean that guyis one rank below me okay i mean i i'llrank that deserterby by one rank so i was likei definitely don't feel like i'm worthytoswap with five isis leaders i meanif i'm ever captured in iraq which i etsnow so i wouldn't be butif i was i definitely don't want thearmy touse me to switch or swap withfive isis leaders i don't think i'mworthy of that buthow come obama did that so to me itonly made sense that he want to releasethose isis leadersand just use this guy as like a pawn toswitchto to make the switch uhultimately i i really felt that he washelping isis because why would you wantto releasethe senior leaders i mean it's five toone it's not even one to one it's fiveto oneit doesn't make sense and uh i've neverseen the usunder obama that we have the navy guyson their knees with guns pointingin their head i mean it's like i it's animage that i have never imagined thatwould happen in my lifetime but it didand uh oh another thing uhremember the uh navy seal team thatkilled bin ladenand do you also remember i even rememberseeing on the news that that seal teamgot into a helicopter crash orgot shot down or something and all ofthem diedlike it was briefly mentioned on thenews but then that's itand you just got me thinking that ifthere's not some high-level corruptionsthatplan it to kill them there's no way thata whole steel team would just die likethatso all those things got me started tothinkthat okay maybe this is not the partyfor me anymoreand i definitely don't feel the lovefor the country on their side so istarted looking on theside on the republican side which i usedtothink they're all racist homophobexenophobe and all those names becausecnn told me sothat then based on my research i justfound out that the republican sideis a better fit for me which is kind oflike banjoright um they want what i like to see inthis country like better trade dealsbring more jobs back to the us fromchinaand uh just having a more fairmarriage-basedimmigration system and you have to workto get to where you want to be noteverything's freebecause we never got anything for freeand my parents moved here years ago inthe 80s andyou know they never got anything freefrom the government but they made itthroughand it was a pretty good storyso yeah and i just feel like this is abetter fit forfor me andwhich i am i'm still open-mindedi'm still you know all for empoweringwomen and i'mstill uh you know all fighting forequality for all peopleso i still carry the same values i oncedidi just feel like only on this sideon the republican side that i feel thatthesevalues are actually being realizenot just talking just not just only talktalk talkbut actually using real actions to uhdo it in the right way so notnot like what's on the left thatthey're weaponizing it to attack theother sideslike i'm all for like say 1930sfeminists because they were actuallyfighting forequal rights for women but today i feellike they're justhating men which to me it's like i wantyou to beall empowered there shouldn't be uhunequal rights or unequal opportunitiesbetween genders butyou know you shouldn't hate the othergender just because you're not thatgenderit doesn't make sense um andso oh one more thing that uhi like to share because ever since imade the switcha lot of my good friends from highschool andcollege which i thought they were goodfriends of minethey kind of turned their backs on meit's like they started attacking me onfacebook they wereunfriending me or deleting me uhthings like that which to me i was likeokay so we're friends but why couldn'twe have different ideasbut i have some republican friendsgrowing up from like middle schoolhigh school uh they actually never leftme and they stayed friends with me sonow i look back it's like wow this isan interesting thing um but again i'mnot saying alli'm just saying quite a fewfriends who i thought were really goodfriends from collegeuh they kind of just like did a 180 onmeso well thank you all for your time andthat'sgreat to share with you and i feel likeright now i'm on the right side thecorrect side the right side the correctsiteright and uh hopefully this year i don'tknow when the nextelection is going to be because of thevirus sohopefully we can deliver a win for thecountryand unite everyone so see ya

hello Patriots my name is Darlene and Ijust wanted to do a quick video to tellmy story about why I left the DemocratParty and why I plan on to never go backmy story started at the end of 2013prior to 2013 I was brought up Democratraised in a Democrat family by Democratparents when voting with them everyelection cycle and we would just pullthe lever for you know straight Democratticket and it wasn't until the end of2013 that I was working at my job and weworked independently so we could sit atour cubicle and just listen to music orwhatever we wanted to cuz we've got towork by ourselves all day long and Ijust randomly decided that I would startyou know I was like I wonder what youknow Republicans listen to you know whattheir talk and you know what their radioTV is about so I decided to tune intoRush Limbaugh and I started listening tohis radio show and you know one time onetime turned into two times three timesfour times and I just got hooked and Istarted listening to Mark Levin Istarted listening to Alex Jones andInfowars I started listening to stevencrowder just getting all theseconservative perspectives and Republicanviewpoints and I guess the things thatstood out the most to me you know istheir strict stance on immigration andyou know having a proper vetting processin place to make sure that we know who'scoming into the country that was numberone for me that stood out and number twothe absolute protection of the SecondAmendment which is the right to beararms and free market capitalism you knowjust being able to have a free openmarket where you know businesses cancompete with each other you know andthen consumers are able to pick you knowwhichever business or company works bestfor them in their lifestyle so all ofthat sounded good and not to mention Ilike that people on the right andRepublicans you know they're they'rethey're god-fearing people a lot of themthey go to church you know they'reraising their children to be god-fearingkids I mean you know they're god-fearingyou know adults that are teaching theirkids to love the Lord and to go tochurch and readyou know read the Bible and to justpraise God you know because God is ourCreator and you know he made us he knowsus better than anybody so that wasanother thing and at that time in 2013 Iwasn't really serious about my faithlike I am now but I've come a long wayin my walk with Christ and that's one ofthe things that has been special to meabout being a Republican is being ableto share my faith with otherconservatives with other Republicans andthen they just kind of like you know nottheir head and wink at me like yes likewe do love God and we're fearless andyou know but we were fearless but wefear the Lord so that stood out to meand and also I just love the wholetraditional Americana thing you knowthat you get with Republicanconservatives and it's just a vastdifference from what we're seeing withthe left these days you know theDemocrat Party is not the same Democratparty that I was raised in it's not thesame Democrat party that my parents youknow taught me and told me about youknow um I really I didn't really knowthe true history or the true story aboutrepeal about Republicans and Democratslike I never knew the the differencesbetween the two like I said I was justraised in you know Democrat Philadelphiawith my Democrat family my Democratparents but I didn't really do researchor learn really like what each partystood for and it's not like I tookpolitical science in school at all so Ididn't know you know each party and whattheir platforms were and it wasn'treally until I'm even like embarrassedto admit this but I didn't learn aboutthe Democratic Party really what theywere about until 2016 before someselection that I went to go see DineshD'Souza's Hilary's America with myhusband and my girlfriend Tanisha and itwas just mind-blowing i opening it was areally good movie and if you haven'tseen it go see it because it is reallyjust a phenomenal movie and it's acomplete expose of the democrat partyand you know it talks about Jim Crow ittalks about it gives you a history onthe Democrat Party and then of course itjust exposes Hillary Clinton for thelying murdering criminal that she islock her up just sayingum so it's a good movie so go check itout if you haven't seen it so bad moviewas just very informational for me itwas awesome it was really good and itjust set me on fire you know like I wasalready passionate about campaigning andhelping Trump and volunteering you knowin 2016 to get him elected and seeingthat movie like sealed the deal for melike I went full force you know wavingsigns on corners here in Tampa justgoing all in to make sure that Trump gotelected and thank the Lord that he isour president he's doing a phenomenaljob and that's why this midterm electionis is so important you know becauseespecially here in Florida I live inTampa and I'm sure some of you watchinglive in Florida you guys know howimportant this election is and we haveRhonda Sana's who was on our ticket onour side the Republican side and then wehave a socialist Andrew Gilliam and therace is really tight so it's importantthat you get out in November to vote butanyway so that's how I I decided tobecome a Republican from being aDemocrat in my life and it happened mytransformation happened in 2013 and thenat January 2015 I moved to Tampa with myhusband and that's when my wholepolitical fascination took shape and Ihave been just following Infowars andjust reading all kinds of you know theDrudge Report still listening to SeanHannity and Tucker Carlson and you knowmy love of politics has grown and I'velearned a lot in the short few yearsthat I've been on the write that I'vebeen a Republican and I encourage itdoesn't matter what the color of yourskin is it doesn't matter you know itdoesn't matter your race your ethnicityany of that it doesn't matter I became aRepublican because it's it rang truelike the values of the Republican Partyrang true to my values and my moral codeand what I stand for and I think that itwould be the same for you I'm sure andyou know the Democratic Party like Isaid the Democratic Party that I wasraised in is not the Democrat Party oftoday you know these people are outphysically hurting people they'recursing they're yelling at peoplethey're being disrespectful and that'sjust not what our society should be likethese people are running amok andthey're out of control and it's allabout control for the Democrat PartyDemocrats are obsessed with powerthey're obsessed withand that's all it comes down to that'swhy they want illegals you know pouringover the border that's why they want youknow I'm socialism because it's justgonna it tears down the fabric of thesociety in America is a beautifulcountry it's a beautiful country and yesyou know immigration is you know thebedrock of who we are as a nation butyou can come here that's fine but comehere properly come here through theproper channelsdon't jump walls don't swim across theRio Grande or wherever you're comingfrom come here the right way and youknow it is what it is so as a RepublicanI want strong borders I want a free youknow free and open market capitalism youknow I don't want the governmentinvolved in my health care and I wantthe Second Amendment to be protected andthe First Amendment you know which isfree so there you know freedom of speechand the left is censoring conservativesas we know it today shutting down youknow Infowars and alex jones and marktaylor the who does the prophecies he'sbeen silenced so you know the left isreally you know warring with us rightnow but you know just like it says inthe word it says that we are warring andwe're battling you know with evilspirits and evil principalities we'renot warring with flesh and blood so thatwe're in a fight right now so it'simportant that you know we can you knowrally our base and get everyone to thepolls for the midterm elections onNovember 6 so if you are not registeredto vote I think you might have missedthe deadline but you might want to checkwith your supervisor of elections tomake sure that it's not too late for youto register you can do it in office anin person at the office or I think youcan do a mail in or something but checkto see if you are registered or not sodefinitely do that Magga make Americagreat again cog Keep America great

listening to Mark Levin Istarted listening to Alex Jones andInfowars I started listening to stevencrowder just getting all theseconservative perspectives and Republicanviewpoints and I guess the things thatstood out the most to me you know istheir strict stance on immigration andyou know having a proper vetting processin place to make sure that we know who'scoming into the country that was numberone for me that stood out and number twothe absolute protection of the SecondAmendment which is the right to beararms and free market capitalism you knowjust being able to have a free openmarket where you know businesses cancompete with each other you know andthen consumers are able to pick you knowwhichever business or company works bestfor them in their lifestyle so all ofthat sounded good and not to mention Ilike that people on the right andRepublicans you know they're they'rethey're god-fearing people a lot of themthey go to church you know they'reraising their children to be god-fearingkids I mean you know they're god-fearingyou know adults that are teaching theirkids to love the Lord and to go tochurch and readyou know read the Bible and to justpraise God you know because God is ourCreator and you know he made us he knowsus better than anybody so that wasanother thing and at that time in 2013 Iwasn't really serious about my faithlike I am now but I've come a long wayin my walk with Christ and that's one ofthe things that has been special to meabout being a Republican is being ableto share my faith with otherconservatives with other Republicans andthen they just kind of like you know nottheir head and wink at me like yes likewe do love God and we're fearless andyou know but we were fearless but wefear the Lord so that stood out to meand and also I

Democratparents but I didn't really do researchor learn really like what each partystood for and it's not like I tookpolitical science in school at all so Ididn't know you know each party and whattheir platforms were and it wasn'treally until I'm even like embarrassedto admit this but I didn't learn aboutthe Democratic Party really what theywere about until 2016 before someselection that I went to go see DineshD'Souza's Hilary's America with myhusband and my girlfriend Tanisha and itwas just mind-blowing i opening it was areally good movie and if you haven'tseen it go see it because it

talkto you later bye
hey guys thanks for allowing me to jointhis group I've honestly never heard ofthe hashtag walkaway campaign and Iabsolutely want to be a part of thisI've been an independent all my life Ivoted both Democrat and RepublicanRepublican since I started voting wayback in the early 90s you know I alwaystried to look for good leadership andthat outweighs the the party affiliationbecause quite honestly I don't likeparties it's interesting this I guesswhen when you know when Barack ObamaPresident Obama was elected I I didn'tthat was the only time I've never votedand it had nothing to do with thecandidates it's just things werehappening at that time in my lifebut when he won I thought wow that isthat's kind of cool you know I don'tknow what kind of president he's gonnamake but it was nice too it was justneat it was it was a his sighting timein this country to see that happen youknow his his his rhetoric of hope andchange you know I kind of bought thatand I was like okay okay I can take thisI can dig this but hope and change nevercame but what Caymantribalism war so much stuff that Ididn't understand like how in the worlddo you give Iran millions and millionsof dollars in cash at night secretly howwould you do that why would you putmillions of dollars of vehiclessupposedly going to and to help fightterrorism and then uranium army leavesand those that equipment stands there soIsis can now have military equipment Imean there were just so many things thatstarted happening and the media startedchangingstarted placating to this fear this fearof racism this fear of victimhood youknow our police officers are gettingkilled and things start changed I kindof woke up when Donald Trump announcedhis presidency like a lot of you havementioned it was kind of a joke Ithought no way but he was so fun towatch it was fun when he was justtearing up the established RepublicanParty candidates it was funny to watchhim the way he debated against Hillarybut I honestly found that morally hishis his morals were less than good andand I bought the baloney that the hypeand the baloney that was going on so Ivoted for Evan Meek Mill and is eveneven have you ever heard of him have youever seen him since then Johnson he wasanother independent have you seen him atall since the after the election did younotice that during the election whenthey would interview the two they'vealways attacked Donald Trump but theynever attacked Hillary Clinton hmm itmakes you kind of wonder huhyou know those two individuals werethere to pull the moderate conservativeor moderate liberal to to vote for theminstead of voting for Trumpelection night when he took you know allthese states I was like holy crap DonaldTrump's gonna be our president and Bankdived in heaven that he is thank God inheaven that he is our president I willbe voting for you president Trump in2020 I've never seen so much change inmy life I've never seen so much stuffhappen from a president usually theycome in they make a bunch of campaignpromises and then they just kind ofdisappear and it's the you know play isplay the game as normal nothing everhappens nothing really changes you knowyou have a lot of whoo whoo ha ha andthat's about ityou know I know a lot of Democrats thatgo to minority communities and theypromised the world but nothing everhappens right you know and alsoindustrial and blue-collar communitiesthey go on and promise jobs and all ofus and nothing ever transpires but oh mygosh if you I mean think about whatTrump's done and why is he beingattacked he's being attacked like likelike rabid dogs starving rabid dogs Imean not just a DNC and porce they'regonna attack but 90 plus percent of themedia really you know American peopleare not stupid the American people arenot stupid we know we can see we canfigure things out Democratic Party istotally and completely corrupt theremight be individual Democrat politicianswho are good in that and they have thisvirtuous reason why they want to serveI'm not saying that but the DNC as awhole is corrupt it was shown lastwouldn't Hillary Clinton ran why she gotthe nomination why Bernie Sanders wasput to the side and why he kissed herring afterwards and now he'smulti-millionaire and he's the onepreaching socialism yeah let's givelet's take away the power of the peopleto make their own decisions in life andgive it to an elite group of

hey good evening America today is August16th 2019 my name is Tracy Scott and asyou can see I have no makeup on today Iwas natural as natural can get but Ithought that it was really important forme to make this video so here it isFriday night after work I'm relaxed andI'm even in my PJsso typically around this time at nightI'm going through the comments sectionand I'm responding or acknowledging thatI have read the comment and a young manassuming it was a young man asked aquestion what am i walking away from andso of course I give him the response youknow pick up a book read a book learnyour history and I never expected tohear from him againbut he responded again he says yes Iunderstand that that I should read thatI should you know do this I should dothat but what am i walking away to theRepublican Party question mark questionwork and that really got me to thinkingbecause generally speaking if one personasks the question then there's at least10 other people who really want to knowthe answer they're just afraid to askthe question so if you've grown upwhether you be Republican or Democratthat's what she grew up knowing that'sall you know really what is there towalk away from or better put what are wewalking away to so I explained and Ibelieve that walk away is simply ametaphorit's a metaphor for freeing your mindthinking for yourself relying onyourself looking at the factsand understanding that we can beself-sufficient as I stated before Ibelieve we live in a microwave societywhere we want everything quick and wewant it fast we want it now heck we wantit yesterday and that's pride primarilyin my humble opinion what is causing theproblems in America is because peopleare not encouraged to think forthemselves so no you don't have to walkaway to the Republican Party there areother political parties that you couldbe affiliated with personally I closelyidentify with the Republican Partybecause when I look at both parties theRepublican Party is most closely alignedwith my personal values I don't believein abortion I do believe in the right tofree speech I do believe in protectingmyself and when I listen to thesepoliticians today it's crazy but to goback a little bit further my walk awaymoment really came when I startedlistening to Malcolm X yes some of youmay have learned growing up as I didthat Malcolm X was nothing more than areverse racist and he was this horribleperson but I happen to listen to aspeech that he made that was posted onYouTube and it was in the background asI was cleaning the house or somethinglike that and some of the things thisman was saying I thought wow I mean youwould have thought this speech had takenplace last week last month last yearthis man was way before his time butonce I listened to his speech on theDemocrats in America and I will go aheadand post the link down below so that youcan view it for yourself listen toyourself forthat's when my mind really startedopening up do you remember last wasDecember January when the government wasshut down well I will say go this far tosay that my family and I were directlyaffected by that shutdown however wewere able to get through it because weare not totally reliant on thegovernment and no that doesn't mean thatwe have second jobs or anything likethat but walking away doesn'tnecessarily mean walking away from apolitical party it means opening yourmind and really understanding that noone is coming to save you think about ityou know when we want a loaf of bread wetypically go to the grocery store whenwe want gas in our cars we go to the gasstation if the gas station or thegrocery store is closed we are crap outof luck but you know what if you havesome flour in your cabinets and you havesome fresh water and some yeast you canmake your own bread and therefore itdoesn't matter if the grocery store isclosed so I just really want to conveythat walking away is not simply walkingaway from the political party it'swalking away from the establishment it'sthinking for yourself it's doing yourown research and it's not beingdependent on someone else telling youwhat to think now I fully understandthat if you grow up in an area whereeverybody thinks alike it's difficult tonot be in step with everyone elsebecause we all want to be accepted Imean it's it's it's part of human naturewe all want to be accepted we all wantto be loved but sometimes you have tostep out of your comfort zone itorder to understand who you are as aperson so after I had my walkaway momentand it really did begin with hearingMalcolm X's speech on democracy excuseme on the Democratic Party that's when Istarted going forth and looking at thehistory of the Republican Party versusthe history of the Democratic PartyI started looking you know in myneighborhoods in my communities my cityI started looking at my state and Ireally found clarity there was noambiguity about what was going on I meanwe live in a day and age where forexample California wants to have sexeducation for kids starting inkindergarten when most parents don'teven start to have that conversationuntil they're you know preteens again weare being we have put ourselves in asituation where we are reliant on theman's free cheese we have to get out ofthat we and you have to learn how to dothings for yourself learn how to makethat loaf of bread learn how to plant agarden learn how to do things foryourself so that if something happenssomething big happens and the truckscan't get to Safeway or Albertsons orwhatever Trader Joe's whatever grocerystore you typically shop at that youknow that you and your family are goingto be safe so some of the things that Istarted doing and that I would recommendthat you start doing - of course it'sjust recommendation you don't have to doanything you don't want to do I startedsaving a little bit of money everysingle month so in the event of anemergencyI'm not taking on an alone I'm not goingto be put myself and my family in asituation where we're gonna have troublegetting out of it I started learning howto make bread I learned I watched somanyYouTube videos on how to can and now ifyou were to see my garage you wouldthink that I was a crazy cannon ladybecause I know how to canned foodsI remember going into Costco and I wouldsee these huge packages of meat and Iwould think to myself my goodness I wishI could buy that because it's such agreat price but there's no way that wecan eat all that at one time so now I goin and I can those types of things Ialso got chickens I have seven chickensin my backyard and my co-workers thinkI'm crazy until I bring them free eggsanyway walking away is just a metaphorit's opening your mind being respectbeing receptive to other ideas andunderstanding that the government is notyour daddy the government is not yourdaddy and if the crap hits the fan eventhough I love President TrumpI love President Trump he's my hero butI also realized and I recognize that ifsomething hits the fanpresident Trump and his family are goingto be well protected and I'm not gonnasit around and wait for the governmentto come and help me so this young manwho had the question what are we walkingaway from what are we walking to we'rewalking from I'm walking from theDemocratic Party because they're notaligned with my my moral beliefs and I'mwalking to freedom I'm walking tofreedom because I I can beself-sufficient now one of the things Imentioned to this young man is that whenthe government keeps you dependent iseasier for them to have control thinkabout it this way do you remember thattime when Colin Kaepernick the NFLfootball player he would kneel for thenational anthem very disrespectful thinkabout it if he didn't have money if hedidn't rely on that income to keep himand his family fed and goingyou honestly believe that he would havebeen kneeling what for the flag ofcourse notand that's why we go to work every dayand we comply with the rules policiesand regulations of our employers becausewe need that income in order to sustainourselves but when you have it when youhave money and you live in that kind ofa lifestyle it's very difficult forpeople to be able to control you andthat's why we have to strive to beself-sufficient we have to save ourmoney we have to learn skills that ourancestors our forefathers our grandmasnew things that are not typically taughtin the home or for that matter inschools today I remember my grandmotherin law who happens to be a 97 98 yearold white woman she had come to visit usabout 10 years ago and she said heyTracey would you like to make somebutter he said you want me to do what Ican go buy buttershe's like no baby let me show you howto make it and that was another epiphanymoment for me because I learned how tomake butter if I didn't have any butterI could just go out into the store Iwould just go out to the store and buyit she's like what she have cream in therefrigerator you should know that youshould be able to make it yourself sothat's what I did so the moral of thisstory today is really think about whatyou can do in order to help yourselfthink about if the government were toshut down how would you feed your familythink about what you're walking awayfrom and what you hope to be able towalk to no I didn't walk away from theDemocratic Party just to go just to walkto the Republican PartyI left the Democratic Party all rightlet me take that backI left my close association with theDemocratic Party and I'm walking away towhat I consider freedom if you have anyquestions comments concerns or tips andtricks for

hi my name is Wendy and I'm conservativeChristian our grandmother of 10 and atraveling salesladywhen I saw Brandon's video on Facebook Istood up and applauded and I standbeside him and behind him and I thinkwhat he's doing is fantastic I thinkhe's a very courageous man for bringinghimself under fire which he willcertainly be I'm sure he also opened notonly to Democrats and liberals who arenot happy with the way their party isgoing and don't like the hate in thevitriol that's coming from leaders andmembers of the Democratic Party to joinhim but he also opened it up toconservatives who wanted to saysomething about how they've been treatedby the media and by the Democratic Partyas well and I'd like to take thisoccasion to just share a couple thingswith you I was a tea party member whenSeptember 12 2009 I wanted to go andstand up as an individual and state myvoice that I was not happy with atakeover of the health care system bythe government and I was joined by overa million other people who felt the sameway as I did individuals that werespeaking their mind not part of anygroup may be parts of demographics butit's certainly not associated with eachother in any way other than the desireto stand up and be counted and to haveour voices heard the Tea Party was thetrue grassroots movement and I see thehashtag walk away movement as the samething where individuals stand up andmake their statements known make theirpreferences known and their storiesknown and what I find is that when wedeal with each other as individuals it'sa whole different thing than trying totalk to each other as parts of the groupand the Democratic Party is especiallygood at identity politics in putting usinto separate groups putting us in alittle box with a label where they cancontrol us and we're not a nation ofboxes with labels we're not a nation ofgroups were not a nation ofum specialized parties special interestgroups or a nation of individuals andour rights are as individuals theindividual right to life liberty and thepursuit of happiness and I'm fullybehind that with those rights you havean individual responsibility to to livewithin the law and there is such a thingcalled equal protection under the lawwhere no individual no group nodemographic no special interest is abovethe law and we're not really seeing thatright now so if you have equalprotection under the law except for somepeople who are not applied by the lawthen you actually have no protectionunder the law and I think that's a veryscary place to be I'm tired as aconservative being labeled in putting ina box being demeaned being the subjectof late-night humor and I don't like thehow the media is portraying us and theway that we can put that combat that isby actually standing up and saying I'man individual I have my own story I havemy own ideas and there's not a lot ofGandia individuals that are a hundredpercent aligned with each other in theirthinking or in the way they approachlife but we are individuals and it'sindividuals that make this country whatit is so I stand behind Brandon goBrandon hashtag walk awayhi my name is Wendy and I'm conservativeChristian our grandmother of 10 and

hi everybody my name is Jennifer andthis is my walk away story I was raisedas one of Jehovah's Witnesses in thatreligion you are taught to bepolitically neutral no voting nosplitting the flag and no serving in themilitary so when I was 28 I decided toleave that religion and as a result I amshunned by my friends that I've known mywhole life and a lot of my familyincluding my mother who has not spokento me in 13 years when I left it wasscary I didn't have the support systemsince everyone was in that religion butI had some co-workers and there's aquote that I like that says everythingyou've ever wanted is on the other sideof fear that is really proven to be truefor me and a lot of my lifeso I braved on I now realize that thatreligion is a cult because you're notallowed to question anything theycontrol every aspect of your life usingfear and manipulation tactics theycontrol your friends your entertainmentyour clothing and even the shunning Iknow right now we're in a politicalgroup and I'm talking about my religiousbackground but I promise at the endit'll make sense anyway in my new life Ireally wasn't interested in politics butI met my now husband in 2008 and sincehe was really interested in politics Istarted paying attention Obama'scampaign was in full swing by then andwe were captivated by his charisma andhis speeches he made great promisestalking about his new health careprogram and how if you liked her doctoryou could keep her doctor and how if youhad pre-existing conditions it wouldn'tmatter that was appealing to me becauseI have MS and so we ended up voting forhim as a family we got married in 2010and my husband was laid off a monthafter we got married my husband's acollege professor and that's a careerthat you think is risklay off proof you think maybe a factoryjob or a warehouse job but surely not acollege professor but we had to learnthe hard wayit was tough so we felt betrayed byObama because my husband lost his joband we also lost our health insurance asa family and we still now to this day oheight thousand dollars because of thehealth care mandate my husband stilldoesn't have health insurance thispresident who initially gave us so muchhope left us feeling disenchanted anddisgusted and we felt stabbed in theback as his time in office progressed Ibecame more and more enraged Isiscontinued to attack us and he didnothing when the mass shooting in SanBernardino occurred he called itworkplace violence instead of radicalIslamic terrorism our economy continuedto wane and I felt hopeless until 2015when a new candidate was on the horizonenter Donald J Trump his appeal to mewas that he wanted to put America firsthe wanted to keep us safe he promised tobring jobs back to the US he respectedour veterans and he wanted us to thrivehis approach was different than thetypical politician because he wasn't apolitician he was a businessman who yeshas some challenges in the past but hewas able to rebound and he was now abillionaire if he could do this in hispersonal lifewhat could he do for America I thoughtsince he has been in office he has donesome amazing things yet the media likesto call him a racist but let's look atthe facts not only has he given us thelowest unemployment in the last 50 yearsbut he's also given us the lowestunemployment for african-americans andHispanics ever recorded he signed thefirst step' Act which provides prisonersearly release on good behaviorthis ends mass incarceration and reducesmandatory minimum sentencesthis crime law was originally written byJoe Biden and Bill Clinton in 1994so Biden and Clinton wrote this lawTrump fries a good portion of theAfrican American community in jail forminimal charges but Trump is the racistthey got it wrong in 2018 Trump gave 360million to historical black colleges anduniversities which was 32 million morethan Obama if he hated minorities thismuch why would he keep doing things thatbenefit minorities this racist insulthas been used over and over again theysaid it about bush they said it aboutJohn McCain and now they're saying itabout President Trump another thing themedia likes to say is that Trump saidthey were fine people on both sides inCharlottesville as usual they aren'tgiving you the full quote the full quotewas there were fine people on both sidesbut I am NOT talking about neo-nazis andwhite nationalists they should becondemnedtotally he continues to condemn racismcalling it repugnant evil but the mediakeeps going with he's a racist narrativeand this time it is so important that weresearch everything and not just rely onGoogle we should use different searchengines reputable sources and verify theinformation of which we base ouropinions back in the day there used tobe integrity in journalism now it'sbiased grossly inaccurate propagandaI've started this video talking about myJehovah's Witness past I left it becauseit was a cult they didn't allow me toquestion things they only gave me oneline of thinking and when I refused tosign on with that I was discarded andshunned they wanted to control mythinking my behavior my relationshipsand my life in general people stoppedbeing my friends simply because Ithought differentlythey did Jehovah's Witnesses have a lotin common with the left liberals usefear and manipulation tactics for votesthey're insulting and bullying peopleinto voting for them when I think abouthow I left one cult and joined anotheron the left it makes me shudder I am nowfree to think for myself I have acurious mind and I like to learn butmost of all I love truth in closing Iwould like to say that I really tried totalk myself out of posting this videobut it's important that we speak upbecause there's only one side beingheard another reason I felt compelled tomake this video is because I am aminority I am Hispanic of Puerto Ricandescent my husband is black the medialikes to say that conservatives are openonly white there's an awakening going onin this country right now there are alot of conservative voices that areblack brown and every shade of therainbow I am finding out that peopledon't know the history of the Democratsthey don't know that the left was theparty of the KKK slavery and opposecivil rights in the 50s and 60s I justwant to encourage minorities andAmericans in general to speak up andresearch find out if what you know isreally the truth I would like to alsobring something uptraditionally minorities holdconservative values dear we believe inGod we believe in the family being thecornerstone of society and the sanctityof life we believe that hard work paysoff and whatever you put your mind toyou can do those are conservative valuesso why are we voting on the side that istrying to give everything away for freeand taking God out of

all right next up we have Rachel beCanaanhi everyone so I feel like I am in thelineup at the exact right spotbecause I do believe that we arefighting a war can you all hear me okayokay my name is Rachel Buchanan I'm aConnecticut lifelong resident I've leftbut I've come back I love my state and Ilove my country I'm here today because Iwas the other side I was a registeredDemocrat for 25 yearsleading up to the 2016 presidentialelection I realized that I had turned ablind eye to many things the Obama yearswere a blur for me because I wasparenting I was coaching I was focusingon other very important things but Ialso was very naive in the fact that Itrusted the people that we voted for andactually cared about our rights thatthey were actually there to defend theConstitution of the United States and Iput my trust in two people that I shouldnot have I was in the camp originallywhen we had our two final candidates ofnope and no per there was a meme thatwent around with that yard sign thatwhat I would have been that girl butbecause I was also someone who feltcompelled to do my due diligence to makethe most responsible choice in Novemberof 2016 I took the time to educatemyself on both candidates I went downthe rabbit hole of Hillary Clinton Iknow she made me uncomfortable I wasn'tsure why by the time I got to Haiti Iknew why I knew a lot I went back ahundred years if you haven't gonebackwards in the education I highlyrecommend it to everyonefast forward I do my due diligence onDonald Trump now I must say this I grewup in the 90s Donald Trump was in everyrap video that I watched I loved hip-hopAmerican culture and Donald Trumprepresented everything that representedthe unite the American dreamso I had a really difficult time takinghim and being like okay it's cool thatvideoand on that reality show but now he'sgonna be the leader of the free world Ithink some of us needed a minute tocatch up[Music]in my research I also found that DonaldTrump who since as long as you can goback has been consistent and clear inthe message about his love of countryand he didn't just rant and rave andpoint fingers in flame he was actually aprivate citizen offering us solutionsall the way back and he has beenincredibly consistent so I'm marched mybutt as a registered Democrat into the2016 presidential election and I cast myfirst Republican vote my firstRepublican presidential vote for DonaldJ Trump my hand shook I couldn't breatheI like chemo I texted my husband I'mlike I can't believe I just did thatwhat's going on but I knew she wasn'tthe girl and I knew he loved our countryso the first speaker said something thatwas very very important this is aspiritual war but to understand the warif you've always stood where you standnow and you haven't been on the otherside you mustn't scratch your head andthink how did we get here how did thesepeople believe these things how couldthey possibly think that this is okay Iseen her before you fully accountablebecause I've gone I was a registeredDemocrat for 25 years I worked on netVermont's first gubernatorial campaignyou have to go to hell to get to heavenand you have to learn now fast forwardhere I stand in front of you today I gotI went down the rabbit hole I've donemyself education a lot of people aren'twilling to do that they're not very infront to look at the truth right infront of you la la la la la and thefirst date with my husband we had goneto school our whole lives together hewas a registered Republican andimperfect liberal defiance withblasphemy I asked how can you be aRepublican he gave me some logicalresponsible answer about fiscalresponsibility and solution faced andyou know all that good stuff that notfun stuff and I was aglow and he askedin return how can you be a Democrat nowI want you to wait for it because tounderstand the enemy you need tounderstand how profound this moment wasin my response because it's human it'shuman I'm a good personI it's nice rewind 20 years I was aninclusion and diversity trainer for alarge insurgent corporation I was thatgirl who marched into leadershiptrainings and rolled out the trainingthat got us here today I was proud of itI stood in my truth and my reality as aproud liberal there's this time thatthey made our management team take themyers-briggs personality test you'refamiliar with it I think mine would bevery different today if I took it but weall had to take it and then we had toput the acronyms outside our cubicles somy e & FP emotional feeling whatever itwas if you wanted to come talk to RachelBuchanan you needed to read your guidefirst about how to approach me okaybecause I might be sensitive about a fewthings and you might have to come andtalk to me if you're very direct maybe Ican't handle thatI would really need you to approach mein a different way so you better comeprepared or I can't talk to you this was20 years agoI need you to let that land tounderstand the enemy if I was rollingout inclusion and diversity trainingtoday I would be walking into aclassroom talking about pronouns wewould not be able to have a conversationbecause we have taken that human nicepie-in-the-sky good idea and we have runourselves in circlesit's gets me emotional I'm really sorrybut it's it's been a journey after youwalk away you feel very isolated I neverknew Republicans would embrace me Ididn't believe all the stereotypes I wasmore facts based logic show me somethingthe problem was I wasn't seeing it itwasn't being shown I was being shown thepropaganda in the media that they wantedme to see I was coaching I was makingdinner I was doing things I wasn'tpaying attention shame on me one day Istood in my room in my house by myselfand I watching YouTube doing my homeworkbecause the due diligence never stoppedthey never stopped educating myself youcan't go back you just can't go back Ifound a video on YouTube since this guythanks Brandon struck and the videobegins once upon a time I was a liberalnothing has ever resonated with me morethen sitting in my room watching thisvideo the video was only six minuteslong I hope everyone takes anopportunity to watch itBrandon struck the founder of thehashtag walk away campaign came out andsaid once upon a time I was a liberal Ivoted for Hillary Clinton went onlinebecause he was so devastated that DonaldTrump had mocked a disabled reportereven though I voted for himI still didn't like it but guess whatsomeone did a sane rational Republicansend him a compilation of Donald Trumpmocking like seven people the same wayno one was spared wait black woman mandisabled that didn't matter that was hisgesture for the founder of the walk awaycampaign the veil was lifted harshly forme it was a process but for him it was areal band-aid being ripped off you feelisolated alone scared where am I gonnago am I the only one who feels this waybut the walkaway campaign encouragedpeople to come out with video andwritten testimonials talking about whythey too walked away from the Democratparty hundreds of thousands oftestimonials poured in we marched on inDC on Pennsylvania Avenue and we stoodthere that lost the silent majoritysilent no more if you want to know whatwe believe in Brandon I'll quote BrandonScott because I can't do it better thanhe did he said I staunchly reject racismof any kind I reject the marginalizationof any human being based off theirgender or sexual orientationI reject tyrannical groupthink I rejecta system that allows an ambitiousmisinformed dogmatic mob to suppressfree speech and create false narrativesand a pathetically steamroll over thetruth Brandon Strock walk away campaignnow I just need to let this land becausea lot of this sides part we can't be twosymbols and that's why I'm out frombehind my keyboard and I'm standing infront of you today and being brave andexposing myself as someone who was partof the problem problem is you don't knowyou're part of the problem right youdon't know so if someone's stillstanding in front of you having dialogueeven if it's slinging but I'm nottalking about putting hands on and allthis craziness that we've got to but ifsomeone that's within opposition adifferent view is standing in front ofyou they're still talking to you andit's really really important that youknow the enemy I know liberals grow upand a lot of us become conservatives buttwenty years ago my hair Spriggsinclusion and diversity training youthink it's any better now it's gonecrazy and they don't even know it so Iwanted to come out here today to giveyou some hope when you're scratchingyour head and going how can these peoplefeel this way ask them and then showthem don't tell them show them thatvideo of the president doing that fordifferent people you can't deny thefacts that are right in front of youit's hard right I know some can but alot of people are still in the middleunsure of where they fit the hashtagwalk away campaign does not tell peopleto walk to the Republicanparty or to the independent party or theconservatism it just simply means walkaway from the Democrats walk away fromwhat they stand for today because theUnited States of America will never

what's up everybody I am Rick Knight akathe bat philosopher here to give you myhashtag walkaway story so a couple yearsago I decided it was time to leave theDemocrats and I went to the right whereI'm now a libertarian slash conservativeI guess you call me a conservatory thereason I left um you know after afterdoing a lot of reading and a lot ofresearch watching public debates publiclectures watching different videospeaking to a lot of different people onboth sides of the aisle and carefullythinking about the position that I heldI realized that as a Democrat I reallyhad a very weak platform to stand on myposition was terrible I couldn't defendit and as a lover of philosophy Ifigured that if I can't defend thatposition and it's time to give it up andand develop a much stronger a positionthat's exactly what I did by moving awayfrom the Democrats I feel that theycompletely fall short when it comes tothe economy when it comes to politicalpolicies when it comes to social issuesthey are the absolute worst they havebeen spending the last couple of yearsconstantly calling us Nazis and and andwhite supremists and and and completelyvilifying the cisgendered straight whitemale patriarch of the country that theythink is responsible for all the illsthat goes on at some point we have togrow up and realize that people areresponsible for their own future fortheir own actions for the for for theirown life right you have to make do withwhat you have and make it better andbetter and make it the best you possiblycan but to the left it's you know we'reresponsible for their downfall whilewe're getting rich off of their back andthey're here to take it back from us andand and I'm just not with that I'venever been someone who's into or who hadvictimhood status like the left doesthey are too busy competing for the goldmedal at the oppression Olympics theyrealize that all of us in society allhuman beings arewe held in bondage in in our own littleprison trying to break free - and findhappiness and and and make a good lifefor us but the left don't see it thatway they see it as this privilege thatcertain people have based on their skincolor and that's why they live some ofthem live a very good life it's racialpolitics identity politics that I'm justnot with it I'm just not for it this isthe party who don't know what genderthey are they don't know what bathroomthey're supposed to use and they want toforce these new gender rules and laws onus that don't make sense I mean theyalways said that the Republicans wasanti science and it turns out that theDemocrats are actually anti science Ican no longer uh defend that position onthe left and it was time to go and Irealize how annoying and obnoxious someof them are just even in a debate or ina conversation with them they reallydon't have a strong understanding of howthis world works they live outside ofour reality and um and I had to go youknow they don't respect the men andwomen of the Armed Forces which I havethe utmost respect for being that myfather was a Vietnam vet my grandfatherwas a World War two vet they don'trespect our law enforcement that putstheir lives on the line for them to havethe right to to live and to findhappiness and to be safe and to go outthere and protest I mean the police areout there protecting you know theprotest is from both sides and trying tokeep the peace and the left they don'trespect that they they don't love thiscountry they they don't love Americansthey don't love Western societies theywant to tear it down and usher in thisnarrow Marxist a poison poisonouspolitical orthodoxy of social justicewhich is nothing more than Marxismdisguised as as social justice and andand I recognize this of the patterns inthis a few years ago and and I saw itcoming and Iand I done my research I thought aboutit and I purposely went out to arguewith people I knew who I knew wereRepublicans and I knew that they kept upon on political issues and I purposelyput myself there to argue with them toto see you know what gaps do I have inmy knowledge what gaps do I have in inin my political ideology and I realizedI had a ton of gaps and and I couldn'tfill those gaps up no matter how hard Itried because the left has no realmessage they don't have a real platformto stand on at this point in the gamethey're nothing but spoiled brats thatare just trying to get what they wantand if you don't give it to them andthey'll use force to take it and youknow it's time to go you know ThomasPaine once wrote that government is anecessary evil at best an entire aboveone at worse and and that's exactly whatyou seen with the left that they are theworst they're in terrible and and Ican't dumb I just no longer stand on theleft with Democrats so I am out I amgone and you lost another one Democratsand it's no big deal because I'm I'm asmall fry and um but guess what you knowa lot of small fries they add up to tobe big and um a lot of people walkingaway and and that's it so that's all Igot for you tonight thank you everybodyand love you America

my name is Chuck and I'm a libertarian Iwasn't independent for many many yearsfirst off I would like to give a thankyou to the brand instructor for startingthis walk away movement campaign I Ithink it's just a wonderful an idea awonderful thing I'm glad to see he gotthe ball rolling and it's really takingoff I'm glad to see people that are thatare coming to their senses and havingtheir own mind and walking away from theprogressive slash liberal slash Marxistmindset that the Democratic Party hasadopted first off I want to tell you Iwas raised to Democrat my grandfather hewas either president or vice presidentof the local Steel Workers Union and wealways I mean we were raised Democratseveryone in nearly every one of myfamily voted Democrat and I was aDemocrat for many years when I when Iwas in my 20s that started having afamily you know raising kids and thingslike that that's when I became anindependent because you know I had seenthe Democratic Party just you know howthey embraced you know abortion andthings like that I saw that how theywere really just latching on to thingsthat were against my own personalbeliefs and family values and things soI became an independent and my walk awaymy walk away moment happened right afterI'd say during the term of BarackObama's second term as president wellyou know Barack Obama was the presidentand he was a Democrat therefore he wasthe leader of the Democratic Party andwhenever I saw the racial nonsense getstirred up and seeing all that troublecome about which I hadn't seen in in 40years in the late 60s and early 70s Iremember a lot of racial nonsense youknow but that stuff got resolved youknow there's civil rights and things allall like that well it got stirred up allagain what during during Barack Obama'spresidency and I started doing researchabout you know I saw that it was the DNCthe Democratic National Committee thatwas you know chartering all these busesfor these protests I've been in aprinting business for 30-some years andwhenever I see these thousands ofpeople's descend upon the city toprotest the government the protests thecops and all that they're all showing upwith these freshly printed signs andthings stuff's expensive you know peoplethat that was an organized movementcoming out against police officers thepeople that are trying to protect us Ididn't know any races I didn't know anysome white supremacist personally oranything like that I was born I mean Iwas always baptized and married in ablack church by a black preacher there'snot a racist bone in my body and yetbecause any time I speak against BarackObama or some things that he was doingjust to Bush my opinion I was called aracist and everything else that we callthe racists and homophobes and all thatstuff which is a lie you know I've gotgay friends I just I don't get itthe way they turn so radical sovehemently a anti-american is the way Isee itand what really bothers me the last fewyears of Barack Obama's presidency withon that on the run-up to the nextelection when Hillary was gonna wasrunning and and Donald Trump all thepoison that was that was brought forthon the social media platforms and thingslike that I had never seen anything likeit I'd never seen anything like itafter Donald Trump was elected presidentwe've got a understanding Donald Trumpbeing president did not cause the hatredof the left Donald Trump being electedpresident it revealed the hatred of theleft I cannot believe the poison thathas come out of this I've got friendsthat I've had for 40 years that havetotally we're now star friendshipbecause they found out I voted forDonald Trump and I'm an independent I'mnot even a Republican I'm a libertarianmy own son wouldn't even speak to me forover a year and now that just broke myheart just to see it and the proteststhe violent protests that have comeabout after Donald Trump was elected Ijust can't believe it in this country tosee those things just to see people thatsupport the president being attackedphysically all the violence you knowburning up cars throwing eggs at peoplespitting on people throwing feces atpeople you know they're slamming peopleand Mayson people and these empty andTifa thugs you don't even want to get mestarted on those guys I just can'tbelieve it I just cannot believe itI just cannot believe what theDemocratic Party has turned into and howthey have embraced illegal immigration Iwant to tell you something I've beenmarried to a lovely wife for 10 yearswe're getting ready to celebrate ouranniversary next week and she's fromanother countryshe came here legally and you know whatittook us months of red tape andbureaucracy filling on the forms stackthis big and it cost us thousands ofthousands of dollars to get her overhereand know what she's living the Americandream she cherishes this country youknow I believe most people in thiscountry you know they just want to workand provide for their families and beleft alone but the leftist and theprogressives and the Democrats theywon't have it that way they wanted whatyou want to force their nonsensicalviews and ideas on the American publicthat's why people voted for Donald Trumpthey wanted to go a different directionI just I can't believe what theDemocratic Party has turned turned intoyou know when I was a kid I rememberwhen JFK was assassinated and he was oneof my heroes as I grew up he would hewould be a Republican today if he sawwhat was going on the Democratic Partynow how they've turned into communistsand that's basically been taken over bythe Communists the Marxist you knowBarack Obama he was mentored by acard-carrying communist Frank MarshallDavis I did my research on him before Ivote so anybody before you vote at leastdo your research on your candidates andI just want you to know that you knowwhen he was elected president there wereno protests there was no violent youknow racial demonstrations or anythinglike that I just I can't believe it Ican't believe what I see him and mybeloved America has been turned intowell my walk away moment really cameafter the election of Donald Trump whenI saw the poison and the vitriol and theviolence come out totally revealedwhat's in the hearts of these people inthis party it's a shame you ought to beashamed of yourself I cannot believe itprotests you know I go on YouTube andsee videos of women being at salt and anattackand disabled veterans being beaten Ijust can't believe this stuff in thiscountry in America you need to walk awayyou Democrats you need to do someresearch and understand what theDemocratic Party is about and thehistory they're the ones with thehistory of racism and segregation andall that stuff I just I can't believe itthe Democratic Party founded the Ku KluxKlan I just don't get it I just don'tget itbut I love American and I really lovethis walk away movement and you knowwhat you can walk away you could walkaway and turn your back on things thatare anti-american things that areagainst our very heritage in essence ofwho we are America we love each otheryou know we help our neighbors we workhard you know I don't want to see thisplace turned into a third world countryand if it was up to the Democratic Partythat's what they would do but that's allI'm going to say I know I went a littlelong but thanks Brandon for getting thisblock away movement started becausepeople were saying some things that justneed to be said and hopefully you'rehearing some things and you're listeningyou can walk away it's okay to walk awayyou
hi my name is Louise and this is my walkaway video it is such a huge deal thatI'm doing this I come from a backgroundof hardcore Democrats lifelong Democratsliberals definitely could saybleeding-heart liberals socialistsleaning to the point of communistthoughts and I wasn't from one of thosefamilies where politics were on theoutskirts my upbringing was hardcorepolitics 24/7 since I was a small childI was pretty much spoon fed liberalpropaganda from birth and I believedeverything and I fought for everythingthat my family believed in and it wasjust out there in my family that youloved everyoneno one is discriminated against theywouldn't dare say a bad word aboutanyone everyone is equal exceptRepublicans when it came to RepublicansRepublicans are all in a group togetherand they're all evil and they're allracist and stupid so I believed in thisheart you know with all my heart and Iwent out into the world as a young adultand I spouted my opinionwherever I went even if I was at adinner party with people who areconservative and I would you know ruinthe dinner for everyone because I justwas so strong in my beliefs that I wasright and I didn't want to hear otherpeople and this is 30 years ago I'm inmy 50s so this was not like crazy likescreaming at people this was just likeold school I don't want to hear you andmy husband had a group of very dearfriends that were all conservativesand she lost them because of me when wefirst got married which I'm appalled byand I recall the dinner where I had anargument with his friends about Reaganand I didn't know what I was talkingabout and they never were in touch withmy husband ever again and just recentlyhe got in touch with one of them whichI'm so happyand to this day I'd like to apologize tothem because I agree with so much ofwhat they said no and if I can switchover to more conservative thinking and Ican see clearly how insane the left hasbecome and how dangerous and hateful andhypocritical I feel like anyone can andI think everyone on a whole in thecountry has been so stressed out andfeeling the negativity of the media andjust all that terrible terrible energycoming from the left that's madeeveryone feel pretty depressed andconcerned about the state of the countrybut I have to say that since I startedwatching these walkaway videos it is thebest I have felt in the past three yearssince all the election cycle began andseeing everybody in a walk away videosreally incredible smart beautiful wisepeople from all different walks of lifeall different ethnicities andbackgrounds and I'm thrilled and I Itruly feel like everything's gonna beokaybecause the media can do whatever theywant to do and what's happening now withthe walkway movement that's why Americahas always been great because we havesuch an incredible body of people whoare free thinkers and I hate identitypolitics I don't think that it's goodfor anyone to put all their focus onvictimization I come from really reallyhard-working parents and my dad nevermissed a day of work in his life I nevercomplained raised in the depression ofBrooklyn neversaid one story about his past where hewas coming from a place of I was avictim unbelievably poor and he justworked really really hard and was a goodhuman being and even though my mother isstill alive and she's still a hardcoreDemocrat it's just hard for her in 94 toreally understands what's going on she'snot on social media but I think that inthe old you know old school Democratslike my parents age we're so wellintended there was such good intentionbehind it unfortunately I think a lot ofthe political ideas they have are allbased on ideology and they don'tactually play out in real lifethat we'd all love the world to be aperfect beautiful place where there's nocountries where people aren't in a badsituation of course but at the same timeyou can't take in the whole world andsolve everyone's problems everybody hasto you know clean their own lawn takecare of where they where they are andtrust that other people like otherpeople in the walkway movement will dothe same and I just think that there'sso much love out there and in themovement and it's just bashing down allthose lies that everyone's against oneanother and I just can't I I couldn't bejust part of all that hatefulnessand I think over my over 30 years ofvoting slowly slowlyall all that my belief started to crackjust from life experience and seeing howthings really play out and saying that alot of the philosophy behind the liberalmovement might be good in ideology butit doesn't actually work in real lifeand not

hey what's going on everyone I'm EricMuldrow and this is my walk away storytypical upbringing as a black man herein America as a young black person herein America you basically led to believethat the Democratic Party is the partyfor you that the Republican Party or theconservative view because I don'tnecessarily classify myself as aRepublican per se I classify myself as aconservative I obviously fall more inline with the Republican platform theplatform primarily anyway throughout thecourse of my life I just did as I wastold we voted Democrat and when I didvote which was pretty inconsistently Idid vote as a Democrat throughout myadult life I'm professing to be aChristian man but I'm basically livinghowever however I choose to or yourtypical hypocrite because I wouldn'teven classify myself looking back on itnow as ultimately being I wouldn'tclassify myself as actually being bornagain at that time because I wasbasically there was no proof of it therewas no evidence in my life I recallconversations I had with my dad aboutwhether there would be ever be a blackpresident my dad lived through Jim Crowhe lived through the civil rights eraand he died in 2003 but I've just recallmany of the conversations we had overthe years a lot of the things that hesaw he saw colored bathrooms whitebathrooms things that we talk aboutnowadays and we try to compare themodern struggle with what those bravemen and women went through back in theday it's ludicrous to even make thecomparison but he was of the mindsetlike most of us that there would neverbe a black president here in the UnitedStates my dad passed in 2003 as I saidand in 2008 when Obama was electedI recall becoming very emotional at thattime because something was happeningthat I never thought I would see and Ifelt really proud of our country or feltreally proud as a nationto say we elected a black man now Iwasn't really deep into his policies andeverything he stood for to some degreeyes but overall I just you know justwent along because he was a Democrat in2010 the Lord really started working onmy mind and my heart and I startedcoming into a realization of how I wasliving the fact that I was living a lifethat was contrary to the teachings ofScripture contrary to the teachings ofJesus and I was really convicted of mylife my sinful living and the Lordultimately saved me in 2010 which led meto some really sound and solid biblicalteachers who started challenging me onliving a life that is consistent to whatJesus taught with the Apostles taughtthe teachings of Scripture as a wholeand it caused me to just startevaluating my own life the Bible teachesus to as believers to examine ourselvesand I truly started examining myself Itruly started examining myself for thefirst time and which caused me to makesome radical changesI started examining belief systems thatI had this in the world which ultimatelyled me to really taking a hard look atmy political stance my party affiliationone of the main things that really droveme from the Democratic Party was that Istarted seeing my worldview a worldviewthat is the foundation of modern sciencebut biblical Christianity the foundationof modern science a worldview that wasplayed a massive role in the formationof our country but I started seeingconsistently my Christian views beingcast aside and people like me beingreferred to as being homophobic orbigots and just in just some insaneideasnewsflash people just because youdisagree with someone doesn't mean youhate them it doesn't mean that but thatmeaning saying that that mindsetnowadays people will look at me like asif I'm crazyjust for saying that of course it doesyou have to celebrate every aspect ofsomeone's life so I started seeing myview and and when it came to the lifeissue my views as a Christian when Istarted looking at the life issue when Ireally started understanding with Godhow he sees human life and how hecherishes it and man has no place totake it it really caused me to startchallenging my affiliation with theDemocratic Party and then I just starteddigging deeper I started looking intothe history verse told over and overagain how the Democrats were at a partythere was a big switch and they come tofind out that that was just a completeand total fabrication it wasn't true andI just started seeing the ugly darkhistory of the Democratic Party slaveryJim Crow fighting and contending againstevery civil rights bill that wasattempted to be passed as time went onit just got to the point to where I wasit was a no brainer and I had no choicebut to leave and I was already on my wayoutbut just as I have looked at our modernas things are today I had a 20-year longover 20 year law-enforcement careerCorrections prison system a policetrainer Farms trainer active shooterinstructor a pretty extensive one whatI've been noticing today is a push toseparate and cause racial and ethnicdivision based on what the police do nowthe vast majority of people that speakabout the cops and evaluate and and tryto place a judgment on what cops do justdo so from a place of ignorance and Idon't mean that as a as a knock or amockery they just aren't aware of thenuances the danger zones the threatthey're just unaware of the problemsthat a cop sees now there are plenty ofsituations out there where cops havedone wrong and I think of a cop hasviolated someone's rights they need tobe punished even more severely I'm nottrying to minimize that whatsoever butthe vast majority of citizens just don'treally understand the job but I see thisdrive upis politically motivated on mostsituations in most situations that causea division between the races and I seethe primary ones behind that has beenthe Democratic Party and in the careerfield where that I love and I'vesupported and I've given my blood sweatand tears to over the years when I seeit being mischaracterized in the publicand we're all you see is all you see arethe bad things that a police officerdoes or the questionable things that apolice officer does and it's alwaysbeing done to a black man I really seeall that coming from the left and I hadalready been on my way out of theDemocratic Party but that was theultimate straw that truly snapped thecamel's back to where I see themanipulation that's done and now I knowthere are a lot of people out there Ihave a lot of good friends that areDemocrats and lean left and I love themdearly but I honestly think that theirpolicies and their views are destructiveto our society the things that havehappened in the black community with thewelfare state and all the things thathave come as a result of that have beenharmful and been more harmful than goodso that is a very condensed story of myjourney out of the Democratic Party I donot look back now I've been blessed withan opportunity to share my story onsocial media and be bold with myperspective yeah you can get a lot ofhate speech as a black man or a blackperson in general who's come to thisview but I would rather be alone andostracized if it means that I'm on theside of truth and I'm on the side ofright so I'm open to friend requests youguys can friend requests me all you wantand I appreciate the opportunity thatthere are people out there who I knoware in disagreement who who I knowdisagree with me on different points butwe can come to an area we can have alogical rational discussion where wedon't see each other as being thequote-unquote enemy so thank you guysonce again I'm Eric Muldrow andis my where this was my walkaway storyyouhey what's going on everyone I'm EricMuldrow and this is my walk away storytypical upbringing as a black man herein America as a young black person herein America you basically led to believethat the Democratic Party is the partyfor you that the Republican Party or theconservative view because I don'tnecessarily classify myself as aRepublican per se I classify myself as aconservative I obviously fall more inline with the Republican platform theplatform primarily anyway throughout thecourse of my life I just did as I wastold we voted Democrat and when I didvote which was pretty inconsistently Idid vote as a Democrat throughout myadult life I'm professing to be aChristian man but I'm basically livinghowever however I choose to or yourtypical hypocrite because I wouldn'teven classify myself looking back on itnow as ultimately being I wouldn'tclassify myself as actually being bornagain at that time because I wasbasically there was no proof of it therewas no evidence in my life I recallconversations I had with my dad aboutwhether there would be ever be a blackpresident my dad lived through Jim Crowhe lived through the civil rights eraand he died in 2003 but I've just recallmany of the conversations we had overthe years a lot of the things that hesaw he saw colored bathrooms whitebathrooms things that we talk aboutnowadays and we try to compare themodern struggle with what those bravemen and women went through back in theday it's ludicrous to even make thecomparison but he was of the mindsetlike most of us that there would neverbe a black president here in the UnitedStates my dad passed in 2003 as I saidand in 2008 when Obama was electedI recall becoming very emotional at thattime because something was happeningthat I never thought I would see and Ifelt really proud of our country or feltreally proud as a nationto say we elected a black man now Iwasn't really deep into his policies andeverything he stood for to some degreeyes but overall I just you know justwent along because he was a Democrat in2010 the Lord really started working onmy mind and my heart and I startedcoming into a realization of how I wasliving the fact that I was living a lifethat was contrary to the teachings ofScripture contrary to the teachings ofJesus and I was really convicted of mylife my sinful living and the Lordultimately saved me in 2010 which led meto some really sound and solid biblicalteachers who started challenging me onliving a life that is consistent to whatJesus taught with the Apostles taughtthe teachings of Scripture as a wholeand it caused me to just startevaluating my own life the Bible teachesus to as believers to examine ourselvesand I truly started examining myself Itruly started examining myself for thefirst time and which caused me to makesome radical changesI started examining belief systems thatI had this in the world which ultimatelyled me to really taking a hard look atmy political stance my party affiliationone of the main things that really droveme from the Democratic Party was that Istarted seeing my worldview a worldviewthat is the foundation of modern sciencebut biblical Christianity the foundationof modern science a worldview that wasplayed a massive role in the formationof our country but I started seeingconsistently my Christian views beingcast aside and people like me beingreferred to as being homophobic orbigots and just in just some insaneideasnewsflash people just because youdisagree with someone doesn't mean youhate them it doesn't mean that but thatmeaning saying that that mindsetnowadays people will look at me like asif I'm crazyjust for saying that of course it doesyou have to celebrate every aspect ofsomeone's life so I started seeing myview and and when it came to the lifeissue my views as a Christian when Istarted looking at the life issue when Ireally started understanding with Godhow he sees human life and how hecherishes it and man has no place totake it it really caused me to startchallenging my affiliation with theDemocratic Party and then I just starteddigging deeper I started looking intothe history verse told over and overagain how the Democrats were at a partythere was a big switch and they come tofind out that that was just a completeand total fabrication it wasn't true andI just started seeing the ugly darkhistory of the Democratic Party slaveryJim Crow fighting and contending againstevery civil rights bill that wasattempted to be passed as time went onit just got to the point to where I wasit was a no brainer and I had no choicebut to leave and I was already on my wayoutbut just as I have looked at our modernas things are today I had a 20-year longover 20 year law-enforcement careerCorrections prison system a policetrainer Farms trainer active shooterinstructor a pretty extensive

whatever let's let'sjust do itI don't want bullish back in office Idon't want to face back office soI got this job in 2012 working for agovernment contract under the AffordableHealth Care Act and it was all good andgravy I was making great money I hadgreat health care benefits and then Istarted having to actually take phonecalls from people and when I did thatBart man chokes me up just thinkingabout it because of the amount of peoplethat I had to talk out of killingthemselves on the phone the amount ofthreats that I received my facilityreceived my agents received with verydisgruntled and rightfully upset folksthe meetings that I had to sit in wherewe were coached or told that we had topush this we had to push this we had tomake these calls we had to receive thisamount of calls we had to push throughas many people as we could but on theflip we were told about the secrets wewere told about the lies and we stillhad to push itwe still had to agree with it if wewanted to keep her jobs and we still hadto go along with it right so even thenbeing a Democratic supporter I stilldisagreed with it I disagreed with itand the more I heard the earnest storiesfrom these hardworking Americans livesand then their businesses losing theirfamily members because they couldn'tobtain appropriate health care ormedications these elderly people thatwere forced to choose paying theirutilities and their bills their renttheir vehicle payments in these thingsor pay for this absorbedly expensivehealth care coverage that was someminimaland by that I mean a lot of peoplebelieve it or not didn't even qualifyfor it or couldn't qualify for anexemption or worse into MedicaidMedicare and still denied calling usback because they needed help it wasn'tuntil I had this one gentleman whoreally touched my heart so much that Iwas ugly crying on that phone with himthis man was the bedroomthis man had three children his wife hadrecently passed awayand he was living off of his one incomehe reduced and minim minimized hislifestyle he could still barely affordto get groceries every month or hismedications but the insurance for himwould have costed him three times theamount that he was making on hisretirement incomeis that not crazy three times he wasbarely making $600 a month this issomeone who fought for our country hischildren have fought for our country

made my opinion and I walked away andI vowed to that day that day I vowed andto this day forward I'm still Republicanand I'm still marching the streets andI'm still trying to tell people andeducate people and showed them with lovenot hate we don't have to beat up onsomebody that doesn't agree with us theway that we think things should be orsaid or done but you know what we can'tassert ourselves

hello everybody my name's Bruce and thisis the first video I have ever actuallyrecorded I've never even posted onFacebook so I want to say in advance Iapologize if the quality of this isn'tgreat but I did want to do this insupport of Brandon and also in supportof all the other walkaways who have donevideos I've been very very moved by allthe videos you have done and I felt likeI I wanted to add one again for Brandonso a little bit about me I'm a 60 yearold I am a gay man I have votedDemocratic for president from 1980through 2012 and in 2016 when I wasbeginning to think about who I mightsupport as the primaries were werecoming up I was very much unnerved bythe idea that Hillary Clinton could bethe candidate for the Democrats likemany of you I lived through many yearsof controversies and scandals involvingthe Clintons both mr. and mrs. prior tothem getting into office in 92 there wasjennifer flowers there was whitewaterafter they got into office there wasimmediately travelgate there was densefoster Monica Lewinsky and then afterHillary became Secretary of State ofcourse Benghazi and the email serverscandal so the thought of having someonewith that character and that trackrecord in office was just trulynauseating to me even though as a gayman I had already supported DemocratsI just couldn't bring myself to supporther and I figured that the scandalswouldn't stop if anything they wouldonly get worse or more numerous if shewere to be to be placed into office aspresident so I really did look around atother candidates even though as a gayperson it's assumed you're gonna voteDemocrat but I was really looking forsomebody who I felt could get the jobdone could start making changes andaddress some of the issues we've talkedabout for 30-40 years and never doneanything about like immigration like hersoaring deficits and living in theflyover I am particularly have beenconcerned for decades about the loss ofour manufacturing and our business andwhat it's done to our our region I meanI've seen whole communities devastateddisappear but more importantly thefamilies that have been affected sonegativelyit's just has been very very difficultto watch I remember President Obamasaying who a crowd wants in a speech youknow you're gonna have to get over thisidea of jobs coming back because they'rejust not going to and he never seemedeven make an effortso when mr. Trump when he wascampaigning talked about the issue whichhe was one of the first that I canrecall ever saying much about it andactually having a plan to do somethingabout it I was very interested and I wasvery interested also that he was anoutsider it seems like every campaign Ifollowed in the last 3040 years thecandidates clamor to claim the mantle ofbeing an outsider but none of themreally are and when they get in theoffice their actions have shown that soI felt like maybe there was a chancewith with mr. Trump so I thought well Iwill really go out on a limb I willdecide not to vote Democrat and I didvote for mr. Trump and I'm notrather than one bit I've been very happywith what he's done but as I say as agay man you really are expected to voteDemocrat or if you don't you're notgoing to say much about that so therewas one event that happened one onething that happened at the GOPconvention that really kind of told methat I was probably doing the rightthing by by moving away from theDemocrats and that was at the 2016convention in Cleveland for the firsttime an out-and-proud game and actuallyspoke and addressed to that conventionas such and it was a very very importantmoment for me personally and maybe moreimportant than that was how thepresident Trump or candidate Trumphandled that you may recall that at hisacceptance speech he stopped the speechand actually thanked the gentleman forparticipating in the convention andthanked the crowd for so warmly welcomedhim saying that that was long overdueand that was a freeing moment for me tosay hey you do have an option now as agay person you can vote for thecandidate who really personifies yourphilosophies political philosophies andso I was just it was just bawling blownaway by thatwhat happened next though really causedme to run start to run from theDemocrats I had figured that the gaymediawould not likely pick up on what hadhappened at the convention and certainlythe mainstream media probably would nothave either so what I decided to do wasto post on some of the gay media sitesthat if this had actually happened andto let folks know that you know they canmaybe begin to think about a differentother than Hillary the level of vitriolthat I got in response was justastounding to me and very depressing Iwas called a sellout I was called I wastold I was no longer welcome in the gaycommunity I was told I was gonna rot inhell burn in hell you name it it wasjust absolutely astounding to me andthat really was the point where Idecided hey you know I can't go backI've got to move forward and I decidedto support candidate Ron Paul heartedlyat that point so since the election as Isay I've been very pleased with the workthat's been done by the president thusfar but the actions of the Democratssince this of this 2016 election havereally caused me to decide not to lookback not to go back and just run fasterthe level of hate that has beenarticulated by not only the ourrepresentatives and Senators the mediathe close-mindedness the shutting down afree speech all of this I've just foundtotally unacceptableand I can't condone it and I can't lookback and consider the Democrats at leastnot in the foreseeable future so if youare a fellow gay man out there or gayperson disturbs you you you do have achoice you don't have to stay with theDemocratic Party you can vote RepublicanI would say that I not necessarily runto the Republicans so much I did not seethem support the candidate Trumpcertainly not during the NAM theprimaries they certainly didn't help himin the convention they haven't done aheck of a lot for him since so I wouldsay I probably aligned more withlibertarian than Republicanbut still or gay folks out there youhave a choice now and very very happyfor that so again I'm doing this forBrandon Thank You Brandon for all youhave done to organize this group I feellike I have a family now thank you toall the others who have posted and allothers who have supported walk away godbless you all thank youhello everybody my name's Bruce and thisis the first video I have ever actuallyrecorded I've never even posted onFacebook so I want to say in advance Iapologize if the quality of this isn'tgreat but I did want to do this insupport of Brandon and also in supportof all the other walkaways who have donevideos I've been very very moved by allthe videos you have done and I felt likeI I wanted to add one again for Brandonso a little bit about me I'm a 60 yearold I am a gay man I have votedDemocratic for president from 1980through 2012 and in 2016 when I wasbeginning to think about who I mightsupport as the primaries were werecoming up I was very much unnerved bythe idea that Hillary Clinton could bethe candidate for the Democrats likemany of you I lived through many yearsof controversies and scandals involvingthe Clintons both mr. and mrs. prior tothem getting into office in 92 there wasjennifer flowers there was whitewaterafter they got into office there wasimmediately travelgate there was densefoster Monica Lewinsky and then afterHillary became Secretary of State ofcourse Benghazi and the email serverscandal so the thought of having someonewith that character and that trackrecord in office was just trulynauseating to me even though as a gayman I had already supported DemocratsI just couldn't bring myself to supporther and I figured that the scandalswouldn't stop if anything they wouldonly get worse or more numerous if shewere to be to be placed into office aspresident so I really did look around atother candidates even though as a gayperson it's assumed you're gonna voteDemocrat but I was really looking forsomebody who I felt could get the jobdone could start making changes andaddress some of the issues we've talkedabout for 30-40 years and never doneanything about like immigration like hersoaring deficits and living in theflyover I am particularly have beenconcerned for decades about the loss ofour manufacturing and our business andwhat it's done to our our region I meanI've seen whole communities devastateddisappear but more importantly thefamilies that have been affected sonegativelyit's just has been very very difficultto watch I remember President Obamasaying who a crowd wants in a speech youknow you're gonna have to get over thisidea of jobs coming back because they'rejust not going to and he never seemedeven make an effortso when mr. Trump when he wascampaigning talked about the issue whichhe was one of the first that I canrecall ever saying much about it andactually having a plan to do somethingabout it I was very interested and I wasvery interested also that he was anoutsider it seems like every campaign Ifollowed in the last 3040 years thecandidates clamor to claim the mantle ofbeing an outsider but none of themreally are and when they get in theoffice their actions have shown that soI felt like maybe there was a chancewith with mr. Trump so I thought well Iwill really go out on a limb I willdecide not to vote Democrat and I didvote for mr. Trump and I'm notrather than one bit I've been very happywith what he's done but as I say as agay man you really are expected to voteDemocrat or if you don't you're notgoing to say much about that so therewas one event that happened one onething that happened at the GOPconvention that really kind of told methat I was probably doing the rightthing by by moving away from theDemocrats and that was at the 2016convention in Cleveland for the firsttime an out-and-proud game and actuallyspoke and addressed to that conventionas such and it was a very very importantmoment for me personally and maybe moreimportant than that was how thepresident Trump or candidate Trumphandled that you may recall that at hisacceptance speech he stopped the speechand actually thanked the gentleman forparticipating in the convention andthanked the crowd for so warmly welcomedhim saying that that was long overdueand that was a freeing moment for me tosay hey you do have an option now as agay person you can vote for thecandidate who really personifies yourphilosophies political philosophies andso I was just it was just bawling blownaway by thatwhat happened next though really causedme to run start to run from theDemocrats I had figured that the gaymediawould not likely pick up on what hadhappened at the convention and certainlythe mainstream media probably would nothave either so what I decided to do wasto post on some of the gay media sitesthat if this had actually happened andto let folks know that you know they canmaybe begin to think about a differentother than Hillary the level of vitriolthat I got in response was justastounding to me and very depressing Iwas called a sellout I was called I wastold I was no longer welcome in the gaycommunity I was told I was gonna rot inhell burn in hell you name it it wasjust absolutely astounding to me andthat really was the point where Idecided hey you know I can't go backI've got to move forward and I decidedto support candidate Ron Paul heartedlyat that point so since the election as Isay I've been very pleased with the workthat's been done by the president thusfar but the actions of the Democratssince this of this 2016 election havereally caused me to decide not to lookback not to go back and just run fasterthe level of hate that has beenarticulated by not only the ourrepresentatives and Senators the mediathe close-mindedness the shutting down afree speech all of this I've just foundtotally unacceptableand I can't condone it and I can't lookback and consider the Democrats at leastnot in the foreseeable future so if youare a fellow gay man out there or gayperson disturbs you you you do have achoice you don't have to stay with theDemocratic Party you can vote RepublicanI would say that I not necessarily runto the Republicans so much I did not seethem support the candidate Trumpcertainly not during the NAM theprimaries they certainly didn't help himin the convention they haven't done aheck of a lot for him since so I wouldsay I probably aligned more withlibertarian than Republicanbut still or gay folks out there youhave a choice now and very very happyfor that so again I'm doing this forBrandon Thank You Brandon for all youhave done to organize this group I feellike I have a family now thank you toall the others who have posted and allothers who have supported walk away godbless you all thank youhello everybody my name's Bruce and thisis the first video I have ever actuallyrecorded I've never even posted onFacebook so I want to say in advance Iapologize if the quality of this isn'tgreat but I did want to do this insupport of Brandon and also in supportof all the other walkaways who have donevideos I've been very very moved by allthe videos you have done and I felt likeI I wanted to add one again for Brandonso a little bit about me I'm a 60 yearold I am a gay man I have votedDemocratic for president from 1980through 2012 and in 2016 when I wasbeginning to think about who I mightsupport as the primaries were werecoming up I was very much unnerved bythe idea that Hillary Clinton could bethe candidate for the Democrats likemany of you I lived through many yearsof controversies and scandals involvingthe Clintons both mr. and mrs. prior tothem getting into office in 92 there wasjennifer flowers there was whitewaterafter they got into office there wasimmediately travelgate there was densefoster Monica Lewinsky and then afterHillary became Secretary of State ofcourse Benghazi and the email serverscandal so the thought of having someonewith that character and that trackrecord in office was just trulynauseating to me even though as a gayman I had already supported DemocratsI just couldn't bring myself to supporther and I figured that the scandalswouldn't stop if anything they wouldonly get worse or more numerous if shewere to be to be placed into office aspresident so I really did look around atother candidates even though as a gayperson it's assumed you're gonna voteDemocrat but I was really looking forsomebody who I felt could get the jobdone could start making changes andaddress some of the issues we've talkedabout for 30-40 years and never doneanything about like immigration like hersoaring deficits and living in theflyover I am particularly have beenconcerned for decades about the loss ofour manufacturing and our business andwhat it's done to our our region I meanI've seen whole communities devastateddisappear but more importantly thefamilies that have been affected sonegativelyit's just has been very very difficultto watch I remember President Obamasaying who a crowd wants in a speech youknow you're gonna have to get over thisidea of jobs coming back because they'rejust not going to and he never seemedeven make an

hello everyone this is my walk awayvideo my name is Bill I'm in the greatgarden state of New Jersey so I assureyou I am NOT a Russian bot I promise Ido apologize for the noisiness in thebackground the knocking you might hearthere's construction going on across thestreet and it's very noisy I do want tothank the overwhelming positive responseI got to my earlier post without a videoI recently lost my good job here in NewJersey and it's been very difficult infact right now it's extremely difficultso I'll get into that in just a minutebut where do I even startwell I was pretty independent I voted onboth sides of the aisle I always didresearch you know local state federalwhen the elections came up I did myhomeworkI looked things up I looked up votingrecords I looked at both sides I alwaystried to be fair and vote for the personwho I thought was best but in 2016 Iwalked away from the from the DemocratPartyI just cannot vote for another Democratever again because of the identitypolitics that they've been engaged inthe flat-out lies the you know just allthe garbage that's been going on youknow I I didn't vote for Barack Obamamainly because I did the research and Ijust saw him as a figurehead for theDemocrat Party they wanted to have thefirst African American president I meanhe was a novelty that's what he was youknow and I just saw him as aninexperienced politician who was pushedby the party to run for president andthey fully backed him because he was agood speech Giverhe could be their puppet he was apolitical puppet when he was voted ineven though I didn't vote for him I wassure that he was gonna be voted inbecause he had such a push from theparty and America was looking for changeat that point and they wanted to havehope because we were in that recessionhe had that that idea of hope and changesomething new something better so I washopeful I didn't go to work crying Ididn't I was not one of the outspokenpeople who blamed him for everythinggoing wrong but his presidency wasexactly what I thought it was going tobe more of the same the hope and changethat he promised which I had hoped wouldhave come truedidn't happen instead it was you knowdespair there was no more hope it wasdespair and not change but it was moreof the same despair and more of the samethe country just sort of staggered alongfor eight yearsI couldn't vote for him the second timeeither because we were not being pulledtogether as he promised the division wasfarther and farther apart and that theidentity politics just got worse andworse and worse it was during his eightyears that the whole idea of you knowwhite privilege really took hold and itwas during his administration that youknow all these fists and foams you knowyou're a xenophobe you're a homophobeyou're a sexist you're a racist allthose things just like was pushed rightin everybody's faces all the time and wehad riots you know everyone you know noteveryone but a lot of people are sayingoh the Obama years were the greatest wehad riots in this country during hisadministration people got hurt liveswere destroyed businesses were destroyedyou know it wasn't all wonderfuland then 2016 rolls around and I was nota huge supporter of Trump I don't have amag hat I don't wear my politics on mysleeve up to Election Day I didn't knowwho I was going to vote for I trulydidn't but I knew I could not vote Ialmost didn't vote but I knew I couldn'tvote for Hillary Clinton she representedeverything wrong with politics and shewas just gonna carry on the Obama yearsI am certain the Democratic Party wasjust hoping you know the whole noveltyof the first woman after the firstafrican-american president was justgonna carry her right in and you knowthe media was all over that you know itwas all about the glass ceiling so Iheld my nose told them you know push thebutton and voted for trouble I didn'tlike the way he did things but I washoping for change again and I thoughtyou know he's a businessman maybe he'sthe shake-up that we actually need inWashington and if he can deliver on hispromises and actually try to unite thecountry and try to get us back on theright track then it will be worth it Ididn't think he was gonna be voted yeahyou know I I just I was you know I wasunder the impression Hillary was gonnawin no matter what and that was it butthat night came we were all up late andwhen we found out Trump had won theelection I actually said to the TV Isaid I looked when it was announced thatTrump had won the election I just saidplease I hope he can deliver on what hesaid he would now what has happenedsince then is he has delivered on manyof his promises he has made the countryfinancially better the debt I stilldon't like the debt needs to be broughtdown but he brought jobs back he'strying really hard in the face of allthis divisionidentity politics that's still beingpushed and it's being pushed so hard andthe media is hook line & sinker intothat but you know he's trying and yougot to give him credit for doing whathe's done in the face of all thisopposition and you know after theelection where I worked and it was a newjob for me and it was a very good joband you know I have nothing bad to sayabout the people there because thepeople I worked with were very very nicebut there was also the office politicsand after the election there were thecrying'sgoing on people at their desk saying Ijust can't work I'm so distraught peopletaking days off because they're so upsetthey couldn't come to work and I was notone of those people and when I wasinvited to come to the protest marchesin the city I was like no why would Iwant to do that the elections over it'sdone I'm not gonna protest what is thatyou know so I became one of the outcastsand you know I didn't discuss politicsit wasn't on my sleeve I didn't havestuff at my desk I wasn't Trump TrumpTrump no I was just hopeful that thecountry could move on because I didn'tjoin the crowds that were going to theprotests I didn't join the crowds thatwere just sitting there bashing andtalking about the president all the timea few people that did talk to me aboutpolitics I would tell them pleaseyou know we gotta watch what we saybecause other people are around it wasan open office people here and if theyyou know it's that whole mentality thatit us and them and if you're notprotesting and you're not against thepresident you're one of them you knowyou're one of those East or phobes youknow it's not goodand sure enough it built up if youweren't with the in-crowd and with thegroups that were against the presidentyou were a bad person it was sort of thedirty little secret going around youknow if you weren't against thepresident people just found reasons tocomplain about you you know they woulduse other things to push you aside ifyou're not in with that crowd they'regonna find a way to make you the bad guyand sure enough people starteddisappearing and I was fired not forpolitical reasons I was given differentreasons but I know I know what was goingon it's sort of the dirty little secretthe office politicsif you are not with them or you didn'tjoin them you were somehow against themby default and so very very good job I'mhaving a very difficult time I have Imay lose everything very very soon I hadto set up a GoFundMe page becauseunemployment's not cutting it New Jerseyis a very expensive state to live inso where is my white privilige where iseverything being handed to me it's nottrue you know I've already been toldthat I'm overqualified for some jobs Imay be on the street soon I may have tosell everything I have just to existit's it's very difficult all becausesome people decided that I was not oneof them I was not with with with us Iwas with them I was not supportive ofbashing somebody who's the president orthe partyI don't hold anything against them Idon't hate anybody who I used to workwith I think they're misguidedI think there's some issues that need tobe resolved butthere's nothing I can do about thatbecause in New Jersey it's an at-willstate for employment you can be hiredand fired for any reason so I don't havea legal leg to stand on because you knowit's a case of oh well things justdidn't work out so sorry I wasn'taccused of anything horrible it was newsilly stuff that you know was provenwrong but in the end I just want to moveforward and I want this country to besuccessful I want this country to begreatI just try to stay hopeful and I thinkall of you the walkaway movement forbeing so welcoming and so open and I'dlike to be able to help more but I'vegot to find work and I just want to workwith some someplace where people reallyare not divisive or have the mindset ofus and them because we do need to worktogether we can make this country greatagain not just the president we have todo it and if we're blindly following thedivisive politics the divisions it's notgonna workI try to remain hopeful and I hope allof you can hold it togetherI think this movement for for bringingto light and allowing people theopportunity to express how much sadnessthere is and how people are beinglabeled and cast aside simply because ofthe color of their skin and simplybecause they're not part of the in-crowdin their in their areas and are easilytargeted that's not that's not what thiscountry is about so thank you againthank you for this forum[Music]you
hey everybody how's it going I've beenso motivated and blown away byeveryone's walkaway stories and videosthat I decided listen i'ma go ahead andshare minds as well so here is my walkaway story I have been probablydisagreeing with a lot of the Democraticideologies for a while now just beenquiet about it I'm not one who dealswell with conference confrontationespecially when I feel a certain way andwhen you talk to someone they don't it'snot that people agree to disagree peopledon't even at this point seem to want tohear your arguments they don't want tohear what you disagree with they don'tcare if you don't saw it with themthey're ready to either you knowliterally curse you out or they want todismiss you you know become so hatefulin their speech against you send outlittle innuendos when you know they'rereferencing you but at this point Ireally don't even care anymoreI don't care so here's my story I movedI'm from New Jersey and I moved over toPhiladelphia and 1986 when I was sixyears old so I have never really in mymind all the way adapted to city life Ialways like living in the countrysidealways liked living I've never reallyagreed or liked city life just never didso I moved back to New Jersey 2015 andwhen I moved back to New Jersey I was ofcourse transferred everything over mycar registration voters registration andall and when I was registering a boatI'm like oh well what party don't do Isign up for because I do not want tocheck off Democrat don't want to do ityou know my job I'm somebody to votedfor President Obamatwo times twice I voted for him twicebecause you know I knowraeshaif your family your parents everybodythat you know voted Democrat and that'sjust the way that you were raised listeneverybody's Democrat you vote Democratdon't even listen to what they'recampaigning about don't even listen towhat their promises are don't evenlisten to what they are trying to pushwhat agenda they're for vote Democratguess what you do so that's where we'renot what I've always thought like butwhen I really started listeninglistening to what was going on in thiscountry so this doesn't even sound rightyou know so unfortunate that childrencan't go out and play any longer it'sfortunate that you don't feelcomfortable allowing your kids to go outand be children any longer games seem tomonopolize their life video games andcell phones and tablets because youdon't if you're a caring parent youreally don't feel all the waycomfortable allowing your child to justgo out and be a child and play becausethere's always something crazy going onoutside so when I got over here I saidyou know what I'm not gonna register tobe Democrat at all my years of voting asan adult when I turned 18 this is onethe first time that I'm going to flipmyself I'm not gonna be I'm gonna beindependent I don't want to beassociated with Republicans and I don'twant to be associated with Democrats Iam going to be independent so when Iwent to go vote the very first time herein New Jersey it was for the Democraticprimaries because again I voted Democratall of my life so I said okay let me govote for the Democratic primaries wellcome to find out they said well in orderfor you to vote in the Democraticprimaries you have to be affiliated withthe group so we have that your paperworkhere you can either checkoff Democratyou can check out what you have to beaffiliated with somebody something likewell great at least this is what theytold me and maybe a lie I didn't knowany different so I said oh gosh wellI've been Democrat on my life let me goahead and register as a Democrat so Iwent back to being the Democrat eventhough I did not agreethe ideologies of the Democratic Party alot of things that they stood for I ampro-life I believe that God is theauthor and the sustainer of life I don'tbelieve it's in anyone's hand any man'shands to take life that is one of mybiggest pet peeves God said that he knewus and our mother's womb even before wewere the world's were created I'm aBible believer and so great to see somany Christian brothers and sisters I'ma Bible believer I'm a Christ believer Iam a Yahweh believer I'm a god believerand I know that even before we werefashioned and our mothers wound that hecreated destiny and purpose and eachside and in the inside of each and everyone of us and I don't think that it'sany woman any man's choice to play Godno that's that's not our choices we arenot God and so I'm not pro-choice I'mpro-life I am pro-life I am pro-life Iam pro-life I love life I love lifeso thanks forward to the presidentialelection so again there's a lot of mybrothers and sisters on here that lovethe Lord so you won't find this strangeand crazy when I say this so during theprimaries I'm doing the Republicanprimaries and all I was watching thedebates in watching what was going oneven with the Democratic primaries inlaw and went to sleep one night and Idon't know I don't believe Donald Trumpwas elected D I know I'm almost certainhe was not elected as the nominee forthe Republican Party but had a dream andin my dream Donald Trump was presidentso I woke up I'm like ah now you got tobe kidding me there was no way in theworld diamond Trump is gonna be electedpresident number one and number twothere's no way in where I'm ever gonnavote for Donald Trump no wayso yeah I'm almost certain that wasbefore he was the Republican nominee soI this is not a lie that very same daywhen I woke up after thatmy son my oldest son and at that time hewas only eight years old he came in theroom he said dad I just had a dreamDonald Trump was president I'm like whathe said I had a dream Donald Trump waspresident and I said you know what son Iknow he said you know say yeah cuz Ijust had the same exact dream and afterthat dream that's when I really startedpraying and seeking God like God whatwould you have me to vote for and that'sone thing that I had never done with anyelection I had never prayed before Godwho would used to hate what would youhave me to vote for who would you haveme to um to back who would you have meto give my support to and so God beganto say to me stop listening to howthings are said and listen to what isbeing said stop listening to how thingsare being said listen to what is beingsaid and that resonated in my mind stoplistening to how things are being saidand listen to what is being said stoplistening to how things are being saidand listen to what is being said and youknow what come to find out after Istarted listening to what things werebeing said it was the same stuff thatthe Democratic Party was getting my votefor but not delivering on this is what Ivoted for this is the things that yousaid you were going to do this isn't yousaid you were going to build up theurban communities you said that youwould want to be there for the peopleyou said that you wouldn't turn aroundany con you said all of this stuff andyou never delivered on it so I said youknow what people think that I'm crazybut when I heard Donald Trump sayingwhat do you have to lose for voting forme and the truth of the matter was ofwhat did I have to lose it you know Ilook at looked at our communities lookedat what was going on and I said well dowe really have to lose as someone whotakes the time or took the time at fouryears out of my life to go and in doprison ministry to minister to brothersand sisters who were incarcerated to letthem know thateven though you may have messed up inman's eyes even though men men and womenmay have written you off even though manmay have turned their backs on youGod can always give you a second chanceI don't care what you've done I don'tcare where you've been I don't that wasalways my message there's always hopeand there's no difference between me andyou just because you're in prison theonly difference is God gave me grace andI didn't get caught that's the onlydifference so speaking to all of thesemen and women in prison I startedlooking at our community saying my godthis is why the home is Torah becausefathers are not in the home this is whythe homes Arturo because mothers are notin the home these people are missingfrom home when do we see change so Inever thought in my life that I wouldpush a button to vote for a Republicanin my life but I was so happy to cast myvote for president Donald Trump or thennominee and I voted for him I'm notafraid you know I'm not afraid to saythat I will defend if you don't agreewith me you just don't agree with me andthat's the one thing you know um eventhough I never really enjoyed living inthe city life it gave me a little bit ofan edge I don't care if you don't likeme that does not matter but you willrespect me and you know what that's theone thing that I learned they you knowpeople want to preach tolerance peoplewant to preach inclusion people want totalk about discrimination people want totalk about hatred I have never seen somuch hatred discrimination intoleranceracism things in my life until DonaldTrump won the presidency now am I now myjewel I said I had never seen so muchit's not that I had never seen it beforeI had never seen so much but in theworld people is this what we teach ourfamily members is this what we teach ourchildren and I knew that there had to bea change to come because when mychildren started coming home fromelementary school telling me thingsabout our now presidentand degrading his name no we don't dothat in my house we don't do that wehonor our leaders the first off theBible says that we pray for those whoare in authority so that we can lead aquiet and peaceable life because thishonors our God so and for all the peoplewho are on the Left if that's what youwant to call them if you claim to be aChristian I mean and we're followingthis same Bible did you skip over thatpassage where the Bible says to pray forthose who are in authority did you skipover the passage where the Bible saysthat God is the one who sets up kingsand he's the one who takes them down soobviously Dom Donald Trump is in officebecause God allowed it plain and simpleif you don't believe in God I don't knowwhat to tell you you know you don'tbelieve in what I believe in so you'renot going to see the way that I see butI see it that he is in office becauseGod allowed it he allowed it and whilehe's in office I'm gonna pray for himI'm gonna pray for his cabinet membersI'm gonna pray for all of his staffmembers I'm gonna pray for everybodyjust like I prayed for them whenPresident Obama was in office there's nodifference it was just a changing of theguard I'm gonna pray for them just likeI pray for those people when they werein office for President Obama what's thedifference do I want to see my countryfail no do I want to see the communitiesgo down absolutely not absolutely notabsolutely not I want to see peace onearth I want to see that you know somany people seem like that's it'simpossible for there to be peace onearth but one of the greatest recordingartists that I know of I don't own theright sky I'm not gonna play her songbut I'm gonna say her lyrics RochellePharrell she has a song called peace onearth and the song says how can we havepeace in the Middle East if there's notat home how can we have understandingand more and when there's none and thewoman and there's none and the man howcan we heal the wounds of this worldif we cannot heal our own and where doesthis peace on earthagain if not in the home where do we gonow do we let the devil win or do we getup and fight surely we know how toconquer all of our fears bring an end tothe violence bringing into our tears howcan we heal the wounds of this worldif we cannot heal our own and where doesthis peace on earth begin if not in theheart how where does it begin if not inour home so in my home I want to teachpeace in my home I want to teach thatthere's going to be people who don'tagree with you but you still got to lovethem anywayand my home I want to teach that wedon't argue we talk and my home I wantto teach that people are not going toalways like you but you still got tolove them and my home I want to teachpeople teach my children and teach myfamily that when people don't disagreewith you okay let them disagree with youbut still love them I want to teachpeace in my home because that's how youachieve peace on earth if you want toeradicate racism you want to eradicatehatred stop teaching it in your homethat's where it begins it begins in yourhome if racism is not a DNA trait it'snot a DNA characteristic that's notinherit inside of your DNA and geneticmakeup hatred is tallracism is tall you want to heal it youwant to eradicate it you want to destroyit stop teaching it in your home we areone people and if you believe in the Godthat I serve we are one body we are onebody we are many members but we are onebody and that's why I walked away thatis why I walked away I don't want tohave hatred in my heart I don't want tohave hatred for anybody and while thepresident is in office I'm going to prayfor them because listen after I startedpraying and then I started readingyou all know what I'm talking about whenI started reading some of the thingsthat were being said and that's thething that I can't stand like people ifyou would just take the time to read Imean it's out there you know one thingthat I don't like how are you mad atsuppose it Russian hacking okay I don'tcare who leak I don't care I don't careif it was a billy goat who got yourpassword hit the wrong button got usaccess to your email I don't care whodid itexplain to me who said they said whatabout who and did you read itwho's negating the validity of what isbeing said nobody is arguing no I didn'tsay that they're trying to argue aboutoh they hacked our democraticinstitution I don't care who had whatexplain to me why this says this and isthat how you really feel about me isthat how you really feel about my familyis that how you really feel about myfellow human beings explain that that'sanother reason why I walk I walk at thatpoint I ran awayso y'all do hash tag ran away after Ihad that stuff forget walking you betterstart running when you

motivated and blown away byeveryone's walkaway stories and videosthat I decided listen i'ma go ahead andshare minds as well so here is my walkaway story I have been probablydisagreeing with a lot of the Democraticideologies for a while now just beenquiet about it I'm not one who dealswell with conference confrontationespecially when I feel a certain way andwhen you talk to someone they don't it'snot that people agree to disagree peopledon't even at this point seem to want tohear your arguments they don't want tohear what you disagree with they don'tcare if you don't saw it with themthey're ready to either you knowliterally curse you out or they want todismiss you you know become so hatefulin their speech against you send outlittle innuendos when you know they'rereferencing you but at this point Ireally don't even care anymoreI don't care so here's my story I movedI'm from New Jersey and I moved over toPhiladelphia and 1986 when I was sixyears old so I have never really in mymind all the way adapted to city life Ialways like living in the countrysidealways liked living I've never reallyagreed or liked city life just never didso I moved back to New Jersey 2015 andwhen I moved back to New Jersey I was ofcourse transferred everything over mycar registration voters registration andall and when I was registering a boatI'm like oh well what party don't do Isign up for because I do not want tocheck off Democrat don't want to do ityou know my job I'm somebody to votedfor President Obamatwo times twice I voted for him twicebecause you know I knowraeshaif your family your parents everybodythat you know voted Democrat and that'sjust the way that you were raised listeneverybody's Democrat you vote Democratdon't even listen to what they'recampaigning about don't even listen towhat their promises are don't evenlisten to what they are trying to pushwhat agenda they're for vote Democratguess what you do so that's where we'renot what I've always thought like butwhen I really started listeninglistening to what was going on in thiscountry so this doesn't even sound rightyou know so unfortunate that childrencan't go out and play any longer it'sfortunate that you don't feelcomfortable allowing your kids to go outand be children any longer games seem tomonopolize their life video games andcell phones and tablets because youdon't if you're a caring parent youreally don't feel all the waycomfortable allowing your child to justgo out and be a child and play becausethere's always something crazy going onoutside so when I got over here I saidyou know what I'm not gonna register tobe Democrat at all my years of voting asan adult when I turned 18 this is onethe first time that I'm going to flipmyself I'm not gonna be I'm gonna beindependent I don't want to beassociated with Republicans and I don'twant to be associated with Democrats Iam going to be independent so when Iwent to go vote the very first time herein New Jersey it was for the Democraticprimaries because again I voted Democratall of my life so I said okay let me govote for the Democratic primaries wellcome to find out they said well in orderfor you to vote in the Democraticprimaries you have to be affiliated withthe group so we have that your paperworkhere you can either checkoff Democratyou can check out what you have to beaffiliated with somebody something likewell great at least this is what theytold me and maybe a lie I didn't knowany different so I said oh gosh wellI've been Democrat on my life let me goahead and register as a Democrat so Iwent back to being the Democrat eventhough I did not agreethe ideologies of the Democratic Party alot of things that they stood for I ampro-life I believe that God is theauthor and the sustainer of life I don'tbelieve it's in anyone's hand any man'shands to take life that is one of mybiggest pet peeves God said that he knewus and our mother's womb even before wewere the world's were created I'm aBible believer and so great to see somany Christian brothers and sisters I'ma Bible believer I'm a Christ believer Iam a Yahweh believer I'm a god believerand I know that even before we werefashioned and our mothers wound that hecreated destiny and purpose and eachside and in the inside of each and everyone of us and I don't think that it'sany woman any man's choice to play Godno that's that's not our choices we arenot God and so I'm not pro-choice I'mpro-life I am pro-life I am pro-life Iam pro-life I love life I love lifeso thanks forward to the presidentialelection so again there's a lot of mybrothers and sisters on here that lovethe Lord so you won't find this strangeand crazy when I say this so during theprimaries I'm doing the Republicanprimaries and all I was watching thedebates in watching what was going oneven with the Democratic primaries inlaw and went to sleep one night and Idon't know I don't believe Donald Trumpwas elected D I know I'm almost certainhe was not elected as the nominee forthe Republican Party but had a dream andin my dream Donald Trump was presidentso I woke up I'm like ah now you got tobe kidding me there was no way in theworld diamond Trump is gonna be electedpresident number one and number twothere's no way in where I'm ever gonnavote for Donald Trump no wayso yeah I'm almost certain that wasbefore he was the Republican nominee soI this is not a lie that very same daywhen I woke up after thatmy son my oldest son and at that time hewas only eight years old he came in theroom he said dad I just had a dreamDonald Trump was president I'm like whathe said I had a dream Donald Trump waspresident and I said you know what son Iknow he said you know say yeah cuz Ijust had the same exact dream and afterthat dream that's when I really startedpraying and seeking God like God whatwould you have me to vote for and that'sone thing that I had never done with anyelection I had never prayed before Godwho would used to hate what would youhave me to vote for who would you haveme to um to back who would you have meto give my support to and so God beganto say to me stop listening to howthings are said and listen to what isbeing said stop listening to how thingsare being said listen to what is beingsaid and that resonated in my mind stoplistening to how things are being saidand listen to what is being said stoplistening to how things are being saidand listen to what is being said and youknow what come to find out after Istarted listening to what things werebeing said it was the same stuff thatthe Democratic Party was getting my votefor but not delivering on this is what Ivoted for this is the things that yousaid you were going to do this isn't yousaid you were going to build up theurban communities you said that youwould want to be there for the peopleyou said that you wouldn't turn aroundany con you said all of this stuff andyou never delivered on it so I said youknow what people think that I'm crazybut when I heard Donald Trump sayingwhat do you have to lose for voting forme and the truth of the matter was ofwhat did I have to lose it you know Ilook at looked at our communities lookedat what was going on and I said well dowe really have to lose as someone whotakes the time or took the time at fouryears out of my life to go and in doprison ministry to minister to brothersand sisters who were incarcerated to letthem know thateven though you may have messed up inman's eyes even though men men and womenmay have written you off even though manmay have turned their backs on youGod can always give you a second chanceI don't care what you've done I don'tcare where you've been I don't that wasalways my message there's always hopeand there's no difference between me andyou just because you're in prison theonly difference is God gave me grace andI didn't get caught that's the onlydifference so speaking to all of thesemen and women in prison I startedlooking at our community saying my godthis is why the home is Torah becausefathers are not in the home this is whythe homes Arturo because mothers are notin the home these people are missingfrom home when do we see change so Inever thought in my life that I wouldpush a button to vote for a Republicanin my life but I was so happy to cast myvote for president Donald Trump or thennominee and I voted for him I'm notafraid you know I'm not afraid to saythat I will defend if you don't agreewith me you just don't agree with me andthat's the one thing you know um eventhough I never really enjoyed living inthe city life it gave me a little bit ofan edge I don't care if you don't likeme that does not matter but you willrespect me and you know what that's theone thing that I learned they you knowpeople want to preach tolerance peoplewant to preach inclusion people want totalk about discrimination people want totalk about hatred I have never seen somuch hatred discrimination intoleranceracism things in my life until DonaldTrump won the presidency now am I now myjewel I said I had never seen so muchit's not that I had never seen it beforeI had never seen so much but in theworld people is this what we teach ourfamily members is this what we teach ourchildren and I knew that there had to bea change to come because when mychildren started coming home fromelementary school telling me thingsabout our now presidentand degrading his name no we don't dothat in my house we don't do that wehonor our leaders the first off theBible says that we pray for those whoare in authority so that we can lead aquiet and peaceable life because thishonors our God so and for all the peoplewho are on the Left if that's what youwant to call them if you claim to be aChristian I mean and we're followingthis same Bible did you skip over thatpassage where the Bible says to pray forthose who are in authority did you skipover the passage where the Bible saysthat God is the one who sets up kingsand he's the one who takes them down soobviously Dom Donald Trump is in officebecause God allowed it plain and simpleif you don't believe in God I don't knowwhat to tell you you know you don'tbelieve in what I believe in so you'renot going to see the way that I see butI see it that he is in office becauseGod allowed it he allowed it and whilehe's in office I'm gonna pray for himI'm gonna pray for his cabinet

absolutely not absolutely notabsolutely not I want to see peace onearth I want to see that you know somany people seem like that's it'simpossible for there to be peace onearth but one of the greatest recordingartists that I know of I don't own theright sky I'm not gonna play her songbut I'm gonna say her lyrics RochellePharrell she has a song called peace onearth and the song says how can we havepeace in the Middle East if there's notat home how can we have understandingand more and when there's none and thewoman and there's none and the man howcan we heal the wounds of this worldif we

where ourcountry is going and I'm hopeful that ifwe continue to pray that if we continueto seeGod that he will hear our price the Wordof God says that if my people which arecalled by my name will humble themselvesand pray seek my face turn from theirwicked ways then will I hear from heavenI will give their sins I will heal theland and I'm a firm believer in thatScripture and when you look up the wordif if you look at the definition ofEdith because we always think that wordif means whether like it like okay if Ichoose - I choose to know when you lookat the noun definition the noun of theword if it means it's a conditionit's a stipulation and it's arequirement it's a condition it's astipulation and it's a requirement thatmy people we have assumed of my namethey must be subjugated to me they mustturn their terror on their own willdestroy their own power humblethemselves seek my face and pray turnfrom their wicked ways then where will Ihear from heaven I will forgive theirsin and I will hear the land you want tosee peace on earth you want to see otherpeople walk away you want to see healingin the land it starts with us we have torepent first I can't expect people whodon't know God to bring about the changeno we are called to be the change agentsyou know why because God is greater he'sgreater than everything God is greater
knock-knockit's actually don't answer the dooryou know why you see knock-knock jokesare told in a suburban context andtherefore disrespectful to people livingin urban areas particularly the innercities that's why knock-knock jokes areracist and so are you now that'sobviously an exaggerationbut to me that seems to be the narrativeof today's 2018 social justice warriorliberal that's why I am walking away nowfor those of you who don't know what thewalk away movement is it's an onlinemovement started by Russian BOTS inorder to undermine the 2018 midtermelection no that's not what it it's it'sa grassroots movement started out withthrough social media by people whotypically affiliated with the DemocraticParty vote for them volunteer with themor at least have liberal viewpoints andthat that was me that not Democrat butdefinitely left-leaning in the year 2000I was part of the Ralph Nader campaignthat campaign for Nader and 2000 I was aliberal and I still am by 2000 standardsI'm still a 2000 liberal I believe inclean renewable energy I believe inputting a stop to corporate bailoutswhat Ralph Nader would call corporatewelfare I still don't believe inunilateral interventionist foreignpolicy starting wars that cost ustrillions of dollars that used to be aliberal apparently conservatives feelthat way too now so I'm walking away andpart of the walk away movement I hopethat if you are on the fenceleft-leaning but tired of what theestablished left is pushing you'll jointhis movement too now why now what haschanged you know I can't stand anybodytoo far to the left or too far to theright but what has changed what'schanged is what's happening on socialmedia and what's happening on TV theother day I was I saw thefirst walkaway video which is pretty newbut has already gotten hundreds ofthousands of hits and people aresupporting this I was so taken aback bythat what I did is I I put a link on myFacebook page to the song walk awayRenae by the Four Tops great song I puther on there and then I looked at Shortup the top of my newsfeed and then Iedited the post to put the walk awayhashtag on there and suddenly itdisappeared from my newsfeed and I'mthinking maybe Facebook is conspiringlooks that way to me but I can't tellbut I do know that YouTube if you ever Ithought it was the same day or the daybefore you click on the YouTube icon andit takes you to a live feed of BarackObama speaking in South Africa I had tocreate the great displeasure of for thefirst time in my life seeing a bed Obamaspeech he's so shaken up by the factthat a Republican is popular even hisspeeches aren't good anymore and that'ssaying a lot but also on Facebookthrough friends of mine I still consideryou to be my friends if you're watchingthis even if I have unfollowing you evenif I have snoozed you for 30 daysbecause I can't stand your politicalpostings anymore I still consider you afriendwith so much animosity everybody's anexpert on foreign intelligence andsaying the Russians are undermining ourelections and there's also this stuffwith Sarah Sanders being kicked out of arestaurant just for being who she waswith her family and supporting itbecause of who she is and the amount ofpersonal attacks and coupled with thefourth of July just happening a coupleweeks ago and I live overseas now sothat the 4th of July means so much to meand I go on and I want to see fireworksI want to see Patriots and I want tohear the star-spangled banner and we cancriticize America tomorrow I'm justseeing all this horrible stuff saidabout America meanwhile here in Perueverybody's wishing me a happyIndependence Day so that got me to thepoint where I really want to speak upsome of you know who I am and hopefullythe hundreds of thousands of people whoare going to see this video also agreewith me but what has gone on inMedia beyond a social media now I was ajournalist once upon a time neverreached the heights of the worldwide ornationally televised but I do know onething is that a president HillaryClinton is a great human interest storya woman president former first lady notonly that but the cable news networkshave decades and decades of HillaryClinton footage from as far back as the80s maybe even the 70s that they canshow on rerun saw a Hillary presidentHillary Clinton equals ratings so for noother reason that's what they want tosee and the celebrities have jumped onthe bandwagon too and talked enoughabout the Kathy Griffin thing holding itthey severed Donald Trump's head assumethat a real I'm not holding DonaldTrump's head like it should be severedendorsing what the terrorists are doingit in the Middle East severing people'sheads and then George Lopez urinating onthe the star and the walk of famepretending to do it is funny but you'repissing on public property you're notspreading a message of any kind there'sthat other actor I don't remember hisname nor do I care advocating thatpeople do horrible things to DonaldTrump's son it's time for people I don'thave a rational sense about themselvesto speak up and that's me that's methat's us I want I want to be part ofthis movement I've been watching thesevideos the last couple of days I've beenso taken aback by people who seem likethey're so angry about what's happeningbut so matter-of-fact I know my video isnot the best video out there certainlynot the best video quality I don't knowwhere you people are getting yourequipment but I want to know what aboutDonald Trump he it's not exactly a heroof mine but he is the leader of thismovement even if he didn't start it evenif he's not part of it he's still theleader because Donald Trump is the onewho exposed a lot of things first of allthe intolerance of the Republican Partyis gone President Bush himself didn'tpush an intolerance narrative but he wasNev angelical and he pushed that hebrought all the invalid Jellico's withhim Donald Trump has Sean Hannity behindhimeven sean hannity is not talking tomoral majority anymore he's not talkingabout Jerry Falwell he's simply talkingabout jobs he's talking about theeconomy and he's even talking about theeconomy as african-american employmentHispanic employment all the sudden theRepublicans even that the far-rightLodi's are the ones pushing thisnarrative of equality and when somebodynobody wins unless everybody wins it's areally it's a drastic change that a fewyears ago you had to be you had to be ascreaming Liberal Democrat to believeand now the Republicans are taken thatand left the Democrats with these farleft people who just want to accuse thepresident of conspiring with Russia ifyou have some Intel show us the Intelyou've got nothing we know that but thisis personal for me because on electionnight now I didn't support Trump orClinton I supported Gary Johnson and Iwanted him to be the president and thatwas gonna happen but on election night afacebook friend of mine who's no longera facebook friend no longer a friend nolonger anybody to me posted something ifDonald Trump wins the election the KuKlux Klan is gonna take over the countryand so I respond I there's a joke is ifHillary wins and he wrote back with somescathing nasty foul stuff about callingMia we knew each other in high schoolyou were a dirtbag and I guess ma'am hadlong hair and listening to heavy metal Iguess they well I still listen to heavymetal as far as the other thing I reallydon't have a choice anymore but I wouldif I couldand so I private message it's got manywhat's wrong with you and he went offyou can curse at me all you want but hewas making racial slurs against my wifewho she's Peruvian and sexual thingsthat you know if I could reach throughthe screen I would and things I'm stillfriends with his brother I'm stillfriends with his cousin on Facebookain't no I we were friends back then andI like to think we still are but it gotso personal with me that the left wingis so intolerant meanwhile the right iscloser to center than ever that I thinkit's time that those who identify asliberals orat least walk away for the DemocraticParty until they can put out a candidatewho doesn't push this anti Trumpnonsense and there's never Trump errsand all these people who just want toget themselves out there I'm not doingthis for me I'm doing this to supportthese videos of people who are sodifferent than I am demographically butwe keep think so much the same about theUnited States and how I miss it and Iwish I could be part of it but what whatnow what are we going to have some noteshere I don't know some of you postingthese videos I don't know how you do itwithout notes but they're excellentanyway what now think about seven yearsago Jon Stewart hosted the rally to endthe insanity I think it was called andit was so great I mean million ofmillions of people who showed up inWashington to just stop talking aboutthese hot-button issues I'm thinkingPresident Obama to love this hopefullyhe'll show up and make a cameo problemas President Obama was in Connecticut ata political fundraiser that day and thatwas one of many disappointing momentsfor President Obama speaking ofPresident Obama I canvassed for him in2008 remember when I voted for him andyou know that

hey everyone I'm Jeremy Messina and forthose of you who don't know me I'm a 22year old upstate New Yorker who supportsDonald Trump and has support DonaldTrump since day one and will continue todo so throughout his presidency I wantto talk about the walk away campaign andI want you guys to understand where I'mcoming from when I when I talk aboutthis I have worked for the GOP and Ihave also worked in a couple differentpolitical campaigns and gained somecandidates a lot of exposure with thatbeing said I've met a lot of differentpeople that come from a lot of differentplaces and a lot of differentbackgrounds and I can tell you right nowthe nicest people that I've ever workedwith of course are the Trump peopleconservatives the Republicans not theDemocrats I've met with a lot ofDemocrats and I've met with a lot ofRepublicans and the nicest ones everytime are going to be the Republicans Imean it's it's pretty obvious me being atrump supporter in upstate New York I'vereally seen the nastiness that the leftcan bring out New York is a very bluestate probably the most blue state inthe country with exception to Californiaor Chicago and I've been told to killmyself I have been sent death threatsI've had fake accounts made of me I'vehad all sorts of things go on just totry to discredit what I'm doing or tryto get me to stop coming out showing mysupport for Donald Trump and I I justgot news for them it's not gonna happenno matter what I support Donald Trumpand Donald Trump has had it worse thanme or anybody else on the right I meanthe man can't even get up and you knowdo anything throughout his day withoutbeing criticized and I think a lot of ushave walked away even before the walkaway campaign was official I think a lotof people have walked away from theirparty especially the Democrat Party alot of my friends are gay conservativesI have met so many gay conservativesthat have come out and decided that theyare going to support Trump and they aregoing to do it and they're gonna be loudand proud about it and I think that'spretty awesomea lot of my friends have confided in methat it was harder for them to come outand tell people that they weresupporting Donald Trump rather thancoming out and saying that they were gayand I think that really says a lot aboutthe Democratic Party because theDemocrat Party wasn't there for theseguys when they were Democrats they toldme had to think a certain way they toldthem they had to act a certain way theytold me they had to walk a certain wayand you better toe the line or elsewe're not gonna we're not going to be onyour side and you're a disgusting humanbeing for it and I am so happy that withthe people that I have met the peopleI've come across and talked with andlearned from that I had the chance to doso because we know that we're theinclusive party whether you're aRepublican or a conservative whateveryou want to call yourself I call myselfa trump guy I don't even call myself aRepublican anymore because I think thatwithin the party yes the right side Ithink is correct I think the Republicansare closer to being right than theDemocrats but I think that theRepublicans have a lot of work to do andI think a lot of us have walked awayfrom the actual Republican Party I thinka lot of us are now just callingourselves Americans and it feels goodbecause there shouldn't be science youknow there shouldn't be Republican orDemocrat it should just be are youAmerican or not and I think the walkaway campaign provides that platform fora lot of us to do that so I give a lotof credit to some of the people who havereally come out and walked away from theDemocrat Party I've never been aDemocrat but I can tell you from whatI've experienced the hate and thenastiness that I have seen on the Left Imean I've lost accounts I'm a businessI'm a I'm a business owner at 22 yearsold in New York and I've lost accountsbecause of my support for Trump peoplego online and look me up and they see myvideos about Trump they see me postingabout Trump and they they've they'veleft they've canceled their contractswith me even after I've done very goodwork for people they just they can'twork with a guy that supports DonaldTrump because they're so close-mindedand they're so hateful and I thinkthat's really what the Democrat Partyrepresents so much hate and withcelebrities like Kanye West walking awaynow really proving to push the ideas youknow go out and talk about things wellinand express yourself the way that youwant to he took the make America greatagain hat and he put it on and he rockedit like nobody else except for DonaldTrump and I'm happy that people aredoing that I can say you know I'm astraight white male and I don't reallyhave like my own like hey I was a gayguy that walked away from the DemocratParty but I know a lot about walkingaway and I am so proud of everyone thatdoes it and I know it's very hard but ifanybody anywhere needs somebody to reachout to and talk to because it isdifficult it's tough and you know a lotof people are scared I've talked with somany people who say they can't come outand support Trump because they're justso scared that something's gonna happento them or their family so they can'tput a bumper sticker on their carbecause I think their car is gonna getdestroyed and it's happened yeah I meanthere was an old man that was taken outhis car and beaten because he supportedDonald Trump during the election so thenastiness on the left is going tocontinue but I want everyone to knowthat in the Trump family we are veryinclusive and everybody has a spot hereand everybody has a spot I'm sure in thewalk away campaign and everybody justneeds to go out and do it and be proudof who you are and I think Donald Trumpis leading us down that path I reallythink that everything Donald Trump isdoing aligns with the walk away party hewalked away from New York City he walkedaway from his businesses he walked awayfrom everything just to prove thatAmerica needs to be first and everybodyelse that's doing the same thing isreally a hero in my mind and I thinkthat everyone needs to continue doing soeverybody can always reach out to me Iknow all my Trump friends are alwaysavailable as well so thank you guys somuch for watching this video and I hopethat things get better in this countryfor us Trump people but I know at theend of the day we're the tough guys andwe can handle itthank you guys walk awayhey everyone I'm Jeremy Messina and forthose of you who don't know me I'm a 22year old upstate New Yorker who supportsDonald Trump and has support DonaldTrump since day one and will continue todo so throughout his presidency I wantto talk about the walk away campaign andI want you guys to understand where I'mcoming from when I when I talk aboutthis I have worked for the GOP and Ihave also worked in a couple differentpolitical campaigns and gained somecandidates a lot of exposure with thatbeing said I've met a lot of differentpeople that come from a lot of differentplaces and a lot of differentbackgrounds and I can tell you right nowthe nicest people that I've ever workedwith of course are the Trump peopleconservatives the Republicans not theDemocrats I've met with a lot ofDemocrats and I've met with a lot ofRepublicans and the nicest ones everytime are going to be the Republicans Imean it's it's pretty obvious me being atrump supporter in upstate New York I'vereally seen the nastiness that the leftcan bring out New York is a very bluestate probably the most blue state inthe country with exception to Californiaor Chicago and I've been told to killmyself I have been sent death threatsI've had fake accounts made of me I'vehad all sorts of things go on just totry to discredit what I'm doing or tryto get me to stop coming out showing mysupport for Donald Trump and I I justgot news for them it's not gonna happenno matter what I support Donald Trumpand Donald Trump has had it worse thanme or anybody else on the right I meanthe man can't even get up and you knowdo anything throughout his day withoutbeing criticized and I think a lot of ushave walked away even before the walkaway campaign was official I think a lotof people have walked away from theirparty especially the Democrat Party alot of my friends are gay conservativesI have met so many gay conservativesthat have come out and decided that theyare going to support Trump and they aregoing to do it and they're gonna be loudand proud about it and I think that'spretty awesomea lot of my friends have confided in methat it was harder for them to come outand tell people that they weresupporting Donald Trump rather thancoming out and saying that they were gayand I think that really says a lot aboutthe Democratic Party because theDemocrat Party wasn't there for theseguys when they were Democrats they toldme had to think a certain way they toldthem they had to act a certain way theytold me they had to walk a certain wayand you better toe the line or elsewe're not gonna we're not going to be onyour side and you're a disgusting humanbeing for it and I am so happy that withthe people that I have met the peopleI've come across and talked with andlearned from that I had the chance to doso because we know that we're theinclusive party whether you're aRepublican or a conservative whateveryou want to call yourself I call myselfa trump guy I don't even call myself aRepublican anymore because I think thatwithin the party yes the right side Ithink is correct I think the Republicansare closer to being right than theDemocrats but I think that theRepublicans have a lot of work to do andI think a lot of us have walked awayfrom the actual Republican Party I thinka lot of us are now just callingourselves Americans and it feels goodbecause there shouldn't be science youknow there shouldn't be Republican orDemocrat it should just be are youAmerican or not and I think the walkaway campaign provides that platform fora lot of us to do that so I give a lotof credit to some of the people who havereally come out and walked away from theDemocrat Party I've never been aDemocrat but I can tell you from whatI've experienced the hate and thenastiness that I have seen on the Left Imean I've lost accounts I'm a businessI'm a I'm a business owner at 22 yearsold in New York and I've lost accountsbecause of my support for Trump peoplego online and look me up and they see myvideos about Trump they see me postingabout Trump and they they've they'veleft they've canceled their contractswith me even after I've

Partyrepresents so much hate and withcelebrities like Kanye West walking awaynow really proving to push the ideas youknow go out and talk about things wellinand express yourself the way that youwant to he took the make America greatagain hat and he put it on and he rockedit like nobody else except for DonaldTrump and I'm happy that people aredoing that I can say you know I'm astraight white male and I don't reallyhave like my own like hey I was a gayguy that walked away from the DemocratParty but I know a lot about walkingaway and I am so proud of everyone thatdoes it and I know it's very

himy name is thelma howard of piusand i am very happy for theopportunity a second opportunity to do avideoi did a textwalk away testimony but now that brandonhas requestedvideos while i'm not verytech savvy and don't feel very extremelycomfortable in thisi'm going to give it a shot so here goesbut this time instead of repeating uhmy first testimony i am going to saywhy i'm still walking and basicallythat is because to remain a supporterof the democrat party i would be anactive and willing participantin the systemic racism designed to holdme backme or my family members or maymaybe even eliminate us completely someof us completelyyou might wonder how this is so whywould i say such a thing as thisso please allow me to explainhow any supporter but especiallya black supporter in my view is caughtin this ugly scenarioconsider this it is very well known thatthe democratparties or the democrats are actuallythe pro-slavery partythe creators of the kkkand jim crow responsible for the brutalbeatingslynchings and church bombingsany and all segregationist actsperpetrated against black people oncethey were freedagain now whilemany would blow this off as now historythe democrats are showing thatseemingly getting rid of blacks is stilla primary objectiveonly now their tactics are cloaked indeceptiontheir first tactic is carrying out thewitches of a knownakk supporter and white supremacistsa hater of black people who argued forour extensionextinction because she viewed us asinferior she compared us to weedsthat would be margaret sanger shefounded theplanned parenthood for this very purposeand it's working our numbers arediminishingbecause of the black babies that arebeingslaughtered more so than any other groupand just so you'll know uhhaving black people in democratpolitical positionsdid not necessarily help us whendavid daladin exposed planned parenthoodfor selling baby partskamala harris found ways to punish himusing methodsunrivaled for the laws under which sheprosecuted himand barack obama is no exceptionboth barack and pamela has alignedthemselves with joe bidenwhose background is laden with racistquipsand his allianceswith segregationists and kkk members arewell knownsuch as robert byrd obviouslyvoluntarily being a member of this partyspeaks for itselfbut because most blacks have alreadysold their soulto the party lip service and crumbs isall the party needsto give the second tactic they useis to convince us to focus our attentionon a smallnumber of blacks of the manybeing killed those being killedby law enforcement while we must ignoreor at least downplay the most almostexponentially larger number of blacksbeing killed by other blacks and membersof other racesmany argue and i think rightfully sothat the focusis on blacks being murdered by policebecause theythe police are supposed to protect usnot kill usi agreeso does that make the person killed byanother black person less importantthan the person killed by the whiteofficer i think that's the questionthe lives of the innocent andchildren either killed and crossed by oron purposecertainly deserve as much focusas a george floydwhy does he deserve to be buried in anold casketof the victimsor these victims of black on blackviolence etcare all but ignored probably justlight local uh coverage at bestso it leads me to a question what kindof value systemcould this be for us black peopleand where do these values come from ineffectwe have been duped into pointing to thesupremacy of a white person with a badgeand agreeing how much more important heisthan any of our own peoplewhile a white officer basks in the gloryof what is bringing him so muchattention i'm sure he smiles at theironyof black people deciding that it is hisactionsthat makes a black person importantor not important that blackpeople in and of themselvesseem to have trouble finding value intheir own eyesimagine his and the democrats amusementat how a black person's valueis derived deservinglittle more than a welfare handout untila fatal ornear fatal encounter with white policethen their name gets plastered acrossthe helmets of football playersor pandering of the highest level ofdemocrats take placeon a knee in kente clawthen with their next breath theyencouraged us to tear downin the name of protests what many of ourown people struggled to buildstill elevating the supremacy of myofficer even moreso when the democrat party and all theleft-leaningentities which include the mainstreammediaitec hollywood many major corporationsand most colleges and university whenthey come together and support eachotherwith an approach that leads to thediminishing numbersor demise of black people to me that isexactlywhat systemic racism looks likeso now when a person repeatsthe democrat narratives and evenpropaganda without examining orquestioning them when a person defendsdemocrat logic and reasoning withoutexamining or questioningit when a person ignoresthe democrats mostly blatant racisthistory while allowing themselves to bepersuadedto castigate someone else's history whohas done little or no real harm ascompared to the harmdemocrats have done and are still doingto us that person could be said to becomplicitin their own demise at the handsof the real proven racistsi will not be a part of thatso thank you for allowing me to givethis testimony it isi know from a very different perspectiveum but i justhope it can be considered inthe scheme of things and where we aretoday in all this disarraythank you
okay i'm gonna try thisand i'm gonna do thisall right i'm a little nervous okay himy name is dee i live in washingtonstateand i am posting my walk away videoit's been long overdue about a year anda

ronaldreagan who i thought was the stuffiestguy um just way too conservative for mei was having way too much fun i wasdefinitely in the party stage back thenand in that same year i ended up movingup to portland oregonthat's how i came to the pacificnorthwest because my sister was herei'm the youngest of my family and shewas hereand that's pretty much how it was idid not educate myself i kept votingalthough i did vote that it was alwaysjust checking off a box checking off abox checking off a boxi did that with bill clinton twiceeven during uh the monacolewinsky scandal and the same with

I'll start with some background I votedfor Obama both times I was mostly apolitical back then I couldn't told youmuch about Obama's policies really oranything like that I didn't think biggovernment versus small government oranything like that back then I was justit was all face I Obama was a youngerguy and McCain was boring and old andyou know everything was just on on facevalues superficial reasons to vote forhim there was nothing really just thatyoung young me connecting with theyounger with the younger politicianthat's pretty much what it was so Istayed a Democrat when he went upagainst Romney I don't really know why Iguess I just voted for him againand we know anything about Romney hewasn't like Trump is you know you can'thelp but know everything about Trumpbecause it's everywhere but so I votedfor this familiar guy I guess in 2012and then things got weird after 2012he's got really weird and and in thiscountry like it wasn't really like thatbefore so much but like I never beforeit before 2012 I don't remember thinkinglike of myself that's like a white guyso much like that was never somethingthat I that was so pushed when I wasgrowing up it wasn't like it is nowthere wasn't all this race stuff likeyou know I can remember 9/11 and afterit happened the country was united itdidn't matter if you were on the left orthe right and that's where the last timewe were really United you know but likeit got weird after 2012 suddenly likethere was Django and all this weirdmentality about race and it was kind ofunder the surfacenobody was really talking about it itwas just kind of out there I guess Idon't know but uh I stayed with the leftI didn't really walk away until Istarted just having these feelings thisweird kind of how I was going on withthe left you know and I decided to putto the test because what I what Irealized is they just weren't talkingabout things I just her problems theythey were just kind of over looking andI didn't know why really I didn't it wasso it's so hard to kind of pinpointbecause they don't just come out and saythat that they're doing it they don'tjust come out and say that they'reignoring problems you know so you kindof have to test it you just kind of haveto find out so I said something alongthe lines of I couldn't be Yellin theblacklivesmatter was was kind of gettingstarted or whatever I said somethinglike you know isn't it isn't it horribleall these people dying in Chicago yougot kids dying you know I'd read a storyabout a little kid dying in an alley andshow a horrible ways tortured and likeyou know isn't this bad you know whyisn't why isn't being I'm talking aboutthis and one of my liberal friends waslike where you don't get to say that youknow because because you're a white guythat's like that's pretty much what shesaid like you don't get to say that it'slike I don't get this I don't get to saythat I don't get to talk about a realproblem in the world because of my skincolor I I just if you if you don't Ididn't walk awayhonestly I I got pushed away I gotpushed away I I mean if if that doesn'tpush you out then nothing will like ifyou can if you can put up with beingtold that you don't get to talk aboutthe real world then I don't know whatplanet you're I don't even know what'sgoing on inside your head you've gotsomething messed up or you just believein something that I I I don't even knowman because if you're living if youcan't even talkabout real real problems you know andyou just have to invent problems like myyou know this whole white versus blackthing is so invented it's so contrivedbecause I mean I know so many mixedfamilies my daughter's mixed I mean Iknow I know personally mixed familiesand see black and white people inrelationships black yeah little brownwhatever white and they act like thiscountry is just so racist and mean it'sso stupid it's so stick I hate talkingabout race but this is this you knowit's so it's so stupid but my my mydaughter is mixed and she's probably theonly I think she's only white girl onher softball team at least it might notbe the only white girl in their schoolbut it's a predominantly white area andshe's the only the only white girl orI'm sorry she's only nice girl she'sonly girl of color on her softball teamand I've gone to her softball game andshe might be the only one on both teamsit was it was traveling around so be theonly one you know and I mean accordingto Democrats this should be like aJackie Robinson situation and she shouldbe having like rocks thrown at her andyou know like people screaming at herand all kinds of craziness that neverever happens ever you know as far as Iknow she's never had anybody sayanything about her it's getting colderyeah and and and if it did it would beyou know one in 10,000 like it's likesome huge thing and there's nobody youknow if you're if you're a person ofcolor and you come to my townpredominantly white and you have anyproblems you know and there's a onemaybe yeah probably out of like you knowa hundred thousand people there probablyare a couple of course but they act likeit's just the whole country likenationwide like you can't walk down thestreet or you'll know there's notthat that's crazy you know it's all justinvented it's all contrived it's all youcan troll you and I just realize thatit's just all about controlling peopleand then holding them back really likeyou look at what's going on with themthe you know wait that's well talkedabout single a single parent you knowthe way the Democrats keep keep peopledown they keep them on welfarethey're bringing illegal immigrants herethat's like they they care about theillegal immigrants they don't care aboutthe illegal immigrants they care abouttheir votes I'm gonna put them onwelfare I don't want them to go aheadthey don't wanna get ahead thecelebrities in Hollywood they don't careabout illegal immigrants they you knowillegal immigrants clean their homesthey don't they don't care about himthey're not trying to get them ahead butyou know I mean for me you know I ifyou're an immigrant or you're born hereyou know to me you're born in thegreatest country you've got anopportunity and and to me we've got aresponsibility you know it's a countryto try to come together because they'vegot such a great opportunity we reallyneed to I think we really need to try tocome together like like I like I saidwhen I was going up before 2001everybody laughed at Clinton jokes youknow everybody was kind of United youknow everybody watched Jay Leno andlaughed at the jokes about Clinton andhis scandalit wasn't like all of this hostilitytowards left and right you know ifyou're a Republican it just meant youknow at my paying taxes and if you wereDemocrat I don't even know what it meantback then it just I don't I guess I'vebeen she like Bill Clinton playing thesaxophone like I don't even know what Imean back then you know it didn't meanwhat it means today it didn't mean atall what it means today but anywaythat's that's pretty much why I walkedaway it was about I felt you know theidentity politics of it just realizingnow conservatives you know being aconservative being responsible now I'vegot a family I didn't before I've got agood job I'm in school I'm trying tostudy to be an electrician and you knowyou're feminists talking about women youknow about how you know they want tosteer women and things they don't evenwanna do and stuff like thatand how conservatives can't be feministand all this but to me you knowconservative women I purchased I'm talkabout women just for a minuteconservative women are like supersuccessful like my my sister is theTrump voter she's a registered nurse shemakes more money than I doI don't know [ __ ] I'll catch up to herand I'm not like a race that I mean shemakes more money than I do that she'sdoing fine she can take care of herherself and her family just fine youknow and my mom owns our own business mystepmom owns her own business she's abarber you know my my aunt got a degreein engineering like it's and these areall conservatives you know my aunt is atrump supporter I'm not necessarily atrump supporter but he's the presidentand I might vote for him you know I tryto take like a nuanced approach towardsTrump you know what kind of the shapiroapproach i guess a little bit that's youknow I don't hate him I don't love him Imean I love him he's I'm not I don'tworship him you know but yeah that'spretty much it man I don't think I couldever go back being a Democrat because ofwhat they stand for and it's even ifthey weren't even if they ditched theidentity politics which I doubt theywill even if they did ditch the identitypolitics I don't think I'd go back tothem just because of their views onsocialism and taxes and just wasting mymoney and taking my money you know Iunderstand there's gotta be some taxesthat take the minimum you don't have totax me that these outrageous amounts youknow your raw fair programs aren'thelping the country they aren't helpinganybody so you know I'm taking care ofthree kidseverybody that's making their paycheckwhen you're taking money out from themthey're taking money from families youknow and and and we're better at takingcare of our kids and then they go fromit is that's my opinionI'm better taking care of myself I'mbetter taking care of my family I'mbetter helping my friends if there's akid with cancer I can send the kid withcancer $50 whatever on a GoFundMe youknow I'm gonnaI can discriminate my spending on who Ikorte charitably better than thegovernment can when the government'sjust giving out you know checks toanybody anybody it doesn't matter ifthey're good or bad people it's justthey're just a number and they'll votefor me if I give them so it's a bunch ofcrapanyway but thank you for listening andenjoy walking away and staying away[Music]I'll start with some background I votedfor Obama both times I was mostly apolitical back then I couldn't told

race and it was kind ofunder the surfacenobody was really talking about it itwas just kind of out there I guess Idon't know but uh I stayed with the leftI didn't really walk away until Istarted just having these feelings thisweird kind of how I was going on withthe left you know and I decided to putto the test because what I what Irealized is they just weren't talkingabout things I just her problems theythey were just kind of over looking andI didn't know why really I didn't it wasso it's so hard to kind of pinpointbecause they don't just come out and saythat that they're doing it they don'tjust come out and say that they'reignoring problems you know so you kindof have to test it you just kind of haveto find out so I said something alongthe lines of I couldn't be Yellin theblacklivesmatter was was kind of gettingstarted or whatever I said somethinglike you know isn't it isn't it horribleall these people dying in Chicago yougot kids dying you know I'd read a storyabout a little kid dying in an alley andshow a horrible ways tortured and likeyou know isn't this bad you know whyisn't why isn't being I'm talking aboutthis and one of my liberal friends waslike where you don't get to say that youknow because because you're a white guythat's like that's pretty much what shesaid like you don't get to say that it'slike I don't get this I don't get to saythat I don't get to talk about a realproblem in the world because of my skincolor I I just if you if you don't Ididn't walk awayhonestly I I got pushed away I gotpushed away I I mean if if that doesn'tpush you out then nothing will like ifyou can if you can put up with beingtold that you don't get to talk aboutthe real world then I don't know whatplanet you're I don't even know what'sgoing on inside your head you've gotsomething messed up or you just believein something that I I I don't even knowman because if you're living if youcan't even talkabout real real problems you know andyou just have to invent problems like myyou know this whole white versus blackthing is so invented it's so contrivedbecause I mean I know so many mixedfamilies my daughter's mixed I mean Iknow I know personally mixed familiesand see black and white people inrelationships black yeah little brownwhatever white and they act like thiscountry is just so racist and mean it'sso stupid it's so stick I hate talkingabout race but this is this you knowit's so it's so stupid but my my mydaughter is mixed and she's probably theonly I think she's only white girl onher softball team at least it might notbe the only white girl in their schoolbut it's a predominantly white area andshe's the only the only white girl orI'm sorry she's only nice girl she'sonly girl of color on her softball teamand I've gone to her softball game andshe might be the only one on both teamsit was it was traveling around so be theonly one you know and I mean accordingto Democrats this should be like aJackie Robinson situation and she shouldbe having like rocks thrown at her andyou know like people screaming at herand all kinds of craziness that neverever happens ever you know as far as Iknow she's never had anybody sayanything about her it's getting colderyeah and and and if it did it would beyou know one in 10,000 like it's likesome huge thing and there's nobody youknow if you're if you're a person ofcolor and you come to my townpredominantly white and you have anyproblems you know and there's a onemaybe yeah probably out of like you knowa hundred thousand people there probablyare a couple of course but they act likeit's just the whole country likenationwide like you can't walk down thestreet or you'll know there's notthat that's crazy you know it's all justinvented it's all contrived it's all youcan troll you and I just realize thatit's just all about controlling peopleand then holding them back really likeyou look at what's going on with themthe you know wait that's well talkedabout single a single parent you knowthe way the Democrats keep keep peopledown they keep them on welfarethey're bringing illegal immigrants herethat's like they they care about theillegal immigrants they don't care aboutthe illegal immigrants they care abouttheir votes I'm gonna put them onwelfare I don't want them to go aheadthey don't wanna get ahead thecelebrities in Hollywood they don't careabout illegal immigrants they you knowillegal immigrants clean their homesthey don't they don't care about himthey're not trying to get them ahead butyou know I mean for me you know I ifyou're an immigrant or you're born hereyou know to me you're born in thegreatest country you've got anopportunity and and to me we've got aresponsibility you know it's a countryto try to come together because they'vegot such a great opportunity we reallyneed to I think we really need to try tocome together like like I like I saidwhen I was going up before 2001everybody laughed at Clinton jokes youknow everybody was kind of United youknow everybody watched Jay Leno andlaughed at the jokes about Clinton andhis scandalit wasn't like all of this hostilitytowards left and right you know ifyou're a Republican it just meant youknow at my paying taxes and if you wereDemocrat I don't even know what it meantback then it just I don't I guess I'vebeen she like Bill Clinton playing thesaxophone like I don't even know what Imean back then you know it didn't meanwhat it means today it didn't mean atall what it means today but anywaythat's that's pretty much why I walkedaway it was about I felt you know theidentity politics of it just realizingnow conservatives you know being aconservative being responsible now I'vegot a family I didn't before I've got agood job I'm in school I'm trying tostudy to be an electrician and you knowyou're feminists talking about women youknow about how you know they want tosteer women and things they don't evenwanna do and stuff like thatand how conservatives can't be feministand all this but to me you knowconservative women I purchased I'm talkabout women just for a minuteconservative women are like supersuccessful like my my sister is theTrump voter she's a registered nurse shemakes more money than I doI don't know [ __ ] I'll catch up to herand I'm not like a race that I mean shemakes more money than I do that she'sdoing fine she can take care of herherself and her family just fine youknow and my mom owns our own business mystepmom owns her own business she's abarber you know my my aunt got a degreein engineering like it's and these areall conservatives you know my aunt is atrump supporter I'm not necessarily atrump supporter but he's the presidentand I might vote for him you know I tryto take like a nuanced approach towardsTrump you know what kind of the shapiroapproach i guess a little bit that's youknow I don't hate him I don't love him Imean I love him he's I'm not I don'tworship him you know but yeah that'spretty much it man I don't think I couldever go back being a Democrat because ofwhat they stand for and it's even ifthey weren't even if they ditched theidentity politics which I doubt theywill even if they did ditch the identitypolitics I don't think I'd go back tothem just because of their views onsocialism and taxes and just wasting mymoney and taking my money you know Iunderstand there's gotta be some taxesthat take the minimum you don't have totax me that these outrageous amounts youknow your raw fair programs aren'thelping the country they aren't helpinganybody so you know I'm taking care ofthree kidseverybody that's making their paycheckwhen you're taking money out from themthey're taking money from families youknow and and and we're better at takingcare of our kids and then they go fromit is that's my opinionI'm better taking care of myself I'mbetter taking care of my family I'mbetter helping my friends if there's akid with cancer I can send the kid withcancer $50 whatever on a GoFundMe youknow I'm gonnaI can discriminate my spending on who Ikorte charitably better than thegovernment can when the government'sjust giving out you know checks toanybody anybody it doesn't matter ifthey're good or bad people it's justthey're just a number and they'll votefor me if I give them so it's a bunch ofcrapanyway but thank you for listening andenjoy walking away and staying away[Music]

everybody welcome to on the mark want tomake this video today because I want totalk to left us out there Democratvoters and potential Democrat votersweakness weakness is a cancer it's adisease that that needs to be cut outweakness in every way right I mean ifyou you're physically weak you need toexercise you need to do something tostrengthen your body because it's badfor you if you're mentally weak you needto work on that and read books or studysomething and exercise your mind ifyou're emotionally weak that somethingthat can lead to disastrous outcomes inyour and your life your relationshipsweakness is badall around and the left todaynot only is it preying on people'sweaknessesbut it's feeding that weakness it'strying to make any strength that itsconstituent voters has trying to they'retrying to destroy that strength andtrying to weaken you further every dayand the weakness is going to destroy youit's gonna destroy your values is gonnadestroy what you stand for and I've saidit many times in this video a fullradical right-wing United States is nogood what made this country great wasthe ability to have discoursecommunicated work towards improving thecountry little by littleissue by issueand I know that there's a lot ofdivision and divisive miss on the rightbut that divisive nough sponsz to thedivisive miss of the lefthow many leftists have you seen take thesmallest step towards the right and theright embraces them juxtapose that withthe video I did a few days ago where theYoung Turks were ready to deep platformone of their own because he went onMSNBC and he said that the left wasbeing unrealistic in their promises andthat was enough for them to not only saythat that guy should be de platformedbut that MSNBC was a radical right-winginstitution MSNBC radical right-wingthose are the Young Turks now the mediais hurting you a great deal the YoungTurks is public enemy number one in myopinion because they're they're reachingthe young people mainstream media isbasically irrelevant at this pointthat's why I attack the Young Turks somuch but look at what your media didwith this heroine alexandra Ocasiocortez they just won in New Yorkbeating out the incumbent in theDemocrat primary for the Bronx the weakmedia because she's a socialist and theylike her didn't vet her and today onDrudge there's a story finally somebodyvetted miss Cortez and it turns out thatthe girl from the Bronx as she buildsherself there's actually some rich girlfrom Westchester Alexandra Ocasio Cortezis the 1% her daddy bought theirchildhood home in Westchester a 350thousand dollar home $350,000 back inthe 80s so this socialist fighting forthe little people fighting for the poorand impoverished it's actually a richgirl from Westchester New York now ifyou had a media with a spine you'd haveknown that and perhaps you would havevoted for her anyway I mean it's not tosay that she doesn't believe insocialist values but the fact is thatshe had to get elected before somebodyhad the nuts to see and say who shereally wasso like every leftist she's a liar shemade up her own facts Elizabeth Warrenis Native American and Alexandra OcasioCortez is a poor girl from the Bronxyeah my nuts but that weakness in themedia is one thing think about what yourpoliticians are doing to you left thisthink about what they're saying to youblack people black folks the media istelling you you can't do it you cannotsurvive without the government handoutsyou cannot get ahead in life and so manyof you are believing it that it isshocking and we need is shocking youknowlet's just say that America is racistand that there's institutional racismkeeping you downis there more racism than there wasduring slavery during Jim Crow duringthe civil rights movement I mean you'retalking about your forefathers thatlearn to read though learning to readcould mean their death forself-improvement for picking themselvesup by their bootstraps that same stockof people today will stand and march andfight for handouts for bread andcircuses come on black people aren't youembarrassed I mean isn't it degrading tohave Maxine Waters out there a toutingand boasting about the LA riots like shedid way back when like the isn't thatbigotry of low expectations demoralizinghumiliating evenLatinos same thingthat the left in this country believesthat you are incapable of and and don'thave enough to offer that the countrywould accept you through legal means sothey want you to come in through legalmeans but keep in mind the plight ofblack folks in this country underDemocrat rulethat's what waits for you they want youhere as a voting bloc because they'relosing the black vote in in in streamsthey're counting on your weaknessthey're counting on your laziness theysee you as lazy lazy Mexicans with ataco on one hand and a beer and anotherthat they can buy off with 150 bucksworth of food stamps and some subsidy onhousing believe me that's what they seewhen they see you that's all that theyseethe weakness is the cancerif you're sitting out then you'rewatching this and you believe thatyou're weak because of someone else'sstrength which is basically the new newsocialist Democrat platformyou need to check yourself you need tobe embarrassedfor that view you need to feel thehumiliation of that I'm here to shameyou into waking up man or woman ifyou're out there right now and you'remaking excuses for yourself for why youcan'tyou're pathetic there's no other wordfor youyou don't have it worse off than peoplethat look like you had it for a you knowsixty years ago even if you're whitesixty years ago wasn't as easy to bewhite as it is today everything'sgetting better and you're missing outfor bread and circuses for handoutshandouts by the way that will never everhelp you to advanceit'll be just enough to keep you fed youwill never grow beyond that and thereason is simple is a huge gap if you'regetting forty thousand dollars a year inbenefits without a high school diplomaand two kids and no father at home doyou realize you cannot do away with thewelfare you can because your bestprospect is an entry-level job at 25grand who's going to make up that$15,000 because the government will takeaway your help it's a self-perpetuatingsystemand it's based on weakness it's based onthe Democrats counting on you being weakget angry come over to our sidehashtag walk away we got youwe're not gonna take away your foodstamps we're not gonna let you starveconservatives are not about that I mightfind some other ways to doing it wemight give churches incentives forhelping families and communities wemight I don't know you might find someway to wean the country off of you knowfederal programs because we have tobecause it's all gonna fall apart it'snot like we're being mean we're justhoping to be able to save this greatnation it's not a mess not because wewant you to starve on the contrary wewant you to get to work and to do foryourself and

to getthis out far and wide let's see if wecan change some hearts and minds got youall in the next one
[Music]hey everyone it's gonna be makinganother walkaway testimonial Brandonstraw has asked us to contribute so Iwant to make another one do an updateand I want to talk about a high levelwhat started me on this path ofquestioning my allegiance to liberal andprogressive ideologies and also it'smore than that because it's also themedia and this kind of bandwagon thatyou see going on so on a high level whatstarted me was the 2016 election Iremember when Brandon's truck startedthis campaign and released his firstvideo and it really resonated with mebecause it confirmed everything that Ihad been experiencing since around thetime Hillary Clinton became theDemocratic nominee and you might hear mycat meowing he might come join us in thevideo so anyway that's when it reallystarted is when she became the nomineeand I could start seeing some of themedia's chicanery the one thing Inoticed so hard so much is how hard theyfocused on Trump on the negative theywould do anything they could to spin totwist anything abdominal Trump that he'sa horrible racist going to make toconcentration camps and deport so manypeople and it's going to be the Trail ofTearsdid I mention concentration camps Iheard it all and needless to say Iwasn't convinced and so what hadprompted me to research the other side Iwas like you know I guess I I had beenraised a liberal and progressive so Iwas kind of Democrat by defaultI had gotten many lectures about theevils of Republicans and how they justlike the you know the rich keep ongetting richer and the poor get poorerand it's the Republicans fault becausethey're the rich and they want to stayrich and they would keep the poor poorto stay rich for right I got you know Idon't know if that sounded anythingother than like quacking excuse me Iknow I have coronavirus promise but atone time in my life that would have madesense surprisingly so and that's anotherthing I've a pattern I've noticed I'llget to that I guess but the firstpattern II noticed was the intensenegativity in the ad hominem and thecomplete lack of attention to HillaryClinton as well into the problems of heras a candidate it's exactly what they'redoing this time to Joe Biden which youknow if this coronavirus gear seemsawfully coincidental to make you knowIII guess Joe Biden's the candidate forthe Democrats now right now I don't knowthey might replace him but you knowpeople are so tense right now they'rejust so scared they have no time tothink about this or you know think aboutit at all to come to sensibleconclusions and that's something that Qhas talked about is that it's by designthe kind of rat race they have people inthe central banking and theentertainment complex is to keepeveryone distracted and keep everyone'sattention constantly shifting and it'salso the the news excuse me the mediacomplex the news complex which is kindof an extension of the military complexif you ask me in absolutely an extensionof the intelligence complex I shouldamend that it actually is theintelligence complexoperation Mockingbird you should lookthat up that's one thing I guess ifyou're new to walk away look at myoperation Mockingbird and you'll seethat the CIA planted agents into newsmedia's so that they can control theinformation flow to the public duringthat time period so I could see themcoordinating in a really negativefashion they were ready kill and laughthey and of course that my friend I meanI used this term loosely my friends myacquaintances my peers who consumedthese late-night talk show hosts contentwould regurgitate their ridicules andtheir insults that they heard to theirlaugh tracks at me when I would try tohave you know a reasonable conversationand I noticed right away that peoplewere just pushing for Hillary Clintonand against Donald Trump very harshly inthe media and I had to look into HillaryClinton and she was just so toxic overCanada she had so much baggage and youknow I was looking at Hillary Clinton'srecord and Obama's record and then alsothe Bush's record and I came to a reallystartling conclusion that the DemocratParty and the Republican Party werereally two sides of one coin in thatwhat they had in common was Commons wasa really dark and sinister agenda todominate the world and it was actuallytalked about when Hillary Clinton'sWikiLeaks emails she was talking aboutmaking North and South America into onekind of big country ruled and one onekind of international economy so andthat's the open borders agenda is tohave no country how can you have acountry with no borders it makes nosense and yeah so it may be DonaldTrump's policies or making a little bitmore sense now that we have coronavirusbut we'll see people are reallyscared right now so it's important to becomforting to them please be patientwith them we're gonna have to come toterms with some really unsettling thingsabout ourselves and it is aboutourselves it's what we've allowed inwhat we've ingested and we're gonna haveto shine a light on itbut it has to be done kindly we can'trub it in their faceswe have to welcome them with open armsso if you're new to the walk awaycampaign I want to welcome you with openarms no matter what politicalenvironment you come from as long asyou're walking away and this is my kittyhis name is orange he's very sweetanyway we welcome you with open arms andwe're ready to come together as a nationto drop these identity politics andthese progressive ideologies and welljust see each other as people we're justwe're just freedom-loving Americans andwe just want to get on with our liveswe don't want to be ruled by tyrants andyou know and and that's really thebottom line and I feel like when themedia pumps the public full of this fearlike they're doing with coronavirus likethey do with Donald Trump you know likeI mean they do it with everything withwith gun violence in these massshootings they they never let a crisisgo to wastecertainly and allowing them to affectour emotions like this to divide usbetween each other and go at each otherwhen the common enemy is a hidden enemyI'm Donald Trump said this in a tweet hesaid the world is at war with a hiddenenemy we will win something to theeffect of that and it's true and thehidden enemy is kind of ourselves andit's something we're gonna have to cometo terms withbut that's okay we can do it withoutjudgment and without prejudice sowelcome and just trust in yourself inyour own judgmentdo your research let the facts guide youwherever they may just follow the factsand don't let these people get underyour skin because that's how theycontrol youBrennan Strock says it brilliantly ifthey can control how you feel they cancontrol your emotions they control howyou feel they can control how you thinkand it's a hallmark of you knowabuse actually of its gaslighting it'sit's actually really destructive to thepsyche to be subjected to it and so whatwe have to do is turn them off go aboutour lives you know you know selfquarantine if you can you know don't usecommon sense wash your hands for cryingout loud and we'll get through this oneway or another and so just keep prayingfor each other and keep your heart inthe right place because the world welive in has really rewarded people andencouraged people to put their heart inthe wrong place that's what I foundmyself being as a liberal is that myheart was always in the wrong place Ialways wanted to say what sounded goodinstead of what was actually good Iwould say say things you know aboutraces you know I thought voter ID wasracist and it wasn't until I actuallystopped and questioned

[Music]hey guysthis is my official story on how i leftthe left i was raised in a conservativerepublican householdhowever i went through some prettydramatic changes about the end of highschooland by the time i started college i wasa democrata liberal and a hardcore feministi voted for hillary clinton in 2016.however i had no ideawhy i did not do any research on her onthe democratic partyon the policies that they had passedum i simply felt like a really goodperson being a democrat i felt like iwokeenlightened you know spiritual beingi felt like i somehow had this likehigher understanding of how the worldworkedum because i took one political scienceclasshowever feeling good about myself veryquicklytransformed into a toxic lifestyleand i began to make up stories aboutsexism and racismand tell lies about experiences ofpeople i knewum simply to try and prove points umso things just got worse and worse ihated my parents because they wererepublicanum anytime somebody would post somethingconservative on social media i wouldattack them and thingsjust were really bad but i felt likesuch a good personum so things started to change when irealized my best friend who is a latinaand an immigrant is a trump supporterand had been since day oneand i simply could not wrap my headaround the fact thata person with skin darker than minewould be a trump supporter it simply didnot make sense to meso i aggressively approached her aboutit and i experienced something that ihad never onceexperienced with a democrat she gave meanswers that were very well researchedclearly educated based on rationalthoughtum all of these you know reasons why shewas a republicanand why she supported donald trump andthe policies that she was standingbehindi i just had simply no way to respond toher i had no material to have aconversation with her about it i had nonothing to respond to her about why iwas a democratexcept my personal feelings about it andthat i was triggered you knowclassic type aso um ever since that experience ihad kept this in the back of my mindlike [ __ ] i reallywish that i could you know respond thatway and beso well educated about what i stand forpoliticallybut it was just kind of overwhelming toget into i didn't want to start i justwanted to keep like being angryand feeling good about myself so icontinued to be a pretty hystericalperson for about four yearsum i graduated with my degree in nursingand the healthcare field is a veryliberal climate so i just continued withthe group mentality ofbeing a liberal and supportingdemocratic partyhowever i began dating a guy from peruwho was a conservativeand who had experienced socialism andcommunism and terrorism all in hischildhoodand things did begin to change fromthere i started developing moreconservative values without realizing itmy mentality about things started toshiftand i moved to peru the beginning ofthis yearand walking away from america for a bitstepping back made me realize a lot ofthingsyou know living under a different formof government in a different societyreally got me thinking about america andwhat i love about it andyou know that i really do want to knowwhy i believe what i believeso i began tofollow donald trump on instagram thatwas like the best i could do at themomentum and he began talking about the worldhealth organizationand withdrawing funding and he releaseda letter that he wrote to them and i waslike holy [ __ ] this guy is likepretty good and then i noticeda previous friend of mine who was a verystrong liberal and democratum was liking his post on instagram andi was likewhat so i privately messaged her and iasked her about itand we had a great conversation and shetold me you know when you followpolicies and not politicsyou kind of open your eyes and you startto realize that the world is not whatthe media makes you believe it isum so i started doing research on my owni started reading articles and lookingat social statisticsand researching policies that were beingpassed by both partiesand i realized that the democratic partyis not what i thought it wasit was not the utopia that i believed itto behowever i was not ready to come outabout that publicly because the majorityof my friends especially on social mediawere liberal and i had quite a fewimmediate family members who were alsoliberaland strong democrats um so i was justnot ready for thatand then everything with george floydhappenedand i just saw so many things goingaround facebookand instagram and parlor and i was likei i just can't not say anything anymoreso i wrote a post on facebook aboutdonald trumpand i received so many commentsand private messages calling me allsorts of namesum i don't even want to get that muchinto it but it was very very very uglyum lots of backlash lots of your racesyou're a [ __ ] things like that and a lotof people being like i'm disappointed inyouand it just reminded me like this toxiccultureof emotionally manipulating people intobelieving what you believeinto accepting what you want them toaccept it is so manipulativeand that moment i was like i'm donei'm washing my hands i'm closing thedoor i got online i registered as arepublicani'm ready to fill out my absentee ballotbut that's not the end my family groupchat got very politically heatedum things got really crazy my liberalfamily wasvery disrespectful to the conservativeside of my familywhere we always let them you know we wekeep topics off the table we think wouldupset themand they simply were not sharing thesame kind of respect so my fiancedecided to commentand he started sharing some personalexperiences and statistics of whathappened in peru during socialism andcommunismand the terrorist groups that cameand my liberal family members basicallysaid um i don't give a [ __ ]i don't care that your friends grew upparentlessbecause they were murdered in theirhomes by terrorists i don't care thatyou waited in a bread lineto eat one meal a day um i just don'tgive a [ __ ] about any of thatand that is when i really really reallycame to grips with the fact that theleft blatantly disregards truth theyblatantly disregard realityum they try and create things thatsimply do not existum and they want to ignore things thatdoso if you area democrat on the fence about becoming arepublicani simply would encourage you to researchthings yourself it does not take morethan three google searchesto realize what sort of policies arebeing passed on both sidesand make a decision for yourself withoutthe bias of the mediaand without censorship um to figure outreallywhat side you want to be on and whatkind of policies you wantto see past in your communities in yourcities in your states in your countryum it really it is time for us to thinkfor ourselves and to research things andstopyou know looking at the huffington postthat's not researchso yes that was my experience um iwas went from being a very toxic personto having a lot more peace of mindum knowing instead of feelinglike i'm on the right side of thepolitical spectrumum not being angrybeing able to listen to other people notspeeding hatred at them simply becausethey share a different opinion as i doum so yeah red pilltrump 2020 god bless america

hello this is my first video I amAmerican Eagle I was a Democrat for 27years and this video is about how Itransitioned from being a Democrat to aa constitutional libertarian I am NOT aRepublican that was a Democrat for 27years 1986 until 2013 I graduated highschool in 1986 I grew up in a Republicanfamily now I grew up being taughtconservative values and conservativeprinciples love of the flag wealth ofthe country to things that are here toinvaluable and I look the flag I'm gladI was raised with that sense ofreverence for this country and for theplight and the Constitution and thewhole nine yards okay it's a goodcountry I grew up in a socialist town aDemocrat town I would say 95% of myfriends were left of center I would sayall of my teachers at all three levelsof my education before I went to collegehad actually through college also all ofmy professors and all of my teachers inelementary school middle school and highschoolwe're left-wing if I had right-wingteachers they didn't let me know aboutit okay so the combination of beingraised in a Republican family andhanging out in a virtual exclusivesocialist and leftist social settingcoming-of-age I became a moderateDemocrat I used to see perpetual warfareand public assistance as compassionate Ibelieve the Democrat Party to be theparty of civil rights given the passingof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and theVoting Rights Act of 1965 I believe thatthe Republican Party only cared for richpeople and was the party of racism whilethe Democrat Party care cared for theworking people poor people and were theparty of civil rights as a Democratthough I never liked and I neverappreciated the anti-american sentimenton the left and from many of my fellowDemocrats I would hear like America's abad country because of this reason orthat reason and I I just I disagree withthat America is not perfect but it's agreat country it's the greatest countryin history I'll make another video aboutthat as a moderate Democrat I alwayspreferred capitalism over socialism andI still doIII am a capitalist I do believe in thesocialist safety net but capitalism isby far the strongest economic model toever exist it is it is the best economicmodel ever to exist no other economicmodel introduces much wealth withcaptain as capitals in Canada it's avery very it is the strongest economicmodel it is the strongest economic modelway better than socialism all socialismis is the counter-attack of feudalismagainst capitalism capitalism emerged asa response to feudalism and feudalismthen after getting its butt kicked bycapitalism wrapped itself in the name ofsocialism and has launched acounter-attack in the United Statessince the 1880s or so the first time Iwas ever challenged about my Democraticbeliefs liberal beliefs was in August of1992 I was living it out in OaklandCalifornia at the time and I had anafrican-american friend who questionedme on my allegiance loyalty andenthusiasm for governor Clintonsoon-to-be President Clinton as a hugeClinton family growing up Democrat Ivoted for I voted for Dukakis I votedfor Clinton twice I voted for Kerry andI voted for Obama toys myafrican-american friend Dale questionedme in August in August of 1992 excuse meand he asked why I love the Democrats somuch and I said well they're the partyfor the poor and they are the party forcivil rightsand then Dale it was at that time thatDale explained to me what the victimwelfare state was and how it wasactually a continuation of a form ofracism perpetual public assistance whichI at that point that was a compassionatething but Dale spoke with me over thenext couple weeks and he told me aboutthe history of the Democrat Party now upuntil that point I had always believedin the switch okay and when Dale pointedthis out to mehe showed me actually that the Democratsare responsible for primarilyresponsible for the three phases ofracism now this is a this is a black mana black friend talking to me um God resthis soulit took me twenty one years for Dale'swords of truth coupled with other eventsto compel me and walking away from theDemocrat Party there are four reasonswhy I walked away from the DemocratParty number one is the history of theDemocratic Party systemic racism in theUS you know explain that in a secondnumber two is the corruption of theObama administration I'll explain thatin a minute the Democrat Party isevolving more and more and more to theleftokay they are moving away fromliberalism okay there's a differencebetween being liberal and being leftistliberals believe in big government theytend to be Democratic socialists if notsocialistshowever they believe in freedom theybelieve in the Bill of Rights theybelieve in the First Amendment theSecond Amendment they may disagree withyou but they will but they will fightfor your right to disagree and skincolor is completely irrelevant toliberals that's not the case with theleft okay the left is is fixated on skincolor and that is a result of the victimwelfare state which I'll get to in aminute the the fourth reason is themalleable nature of many Democratfriends of mine and many people on theLeft too media disinformation coupledwith the unwillingness to look at theirown party's corruption now there arethree phases of systemic racism the UShistory but the first is the slave state1776 to 1865 the second is the apartheidstate 1865 to 1972 the third phase ofsystemic racism is what I call thevictim welfare state 1965 to the presentnow the slave state affected the entirecountry the apartheid state affected theentire country and so does the victimall fair state I argue that the victimof fair state is perhaps as deadly aseither of the previous two phases ofsystemic races in the US history it'sit's really horrible what what thevictim welfare state has done okaynow there is this narrative advanced bythe left and by the Democrats that therewas this switch between parties theabsolute truth of historic racism whenyou look at systemic racism in theUnited States is that the Democrat Partythis is responsible for the slave statekeeping it going they are responsiblefor what I call the apartheid stateI don't like Jim Crow or Black Codes getthat out of here manit was apartheid that's exactly what itwas infected the whole country and theyare also primarily responsible for thevictim welfare state now what the victimof fair state is is the manifestation ofthe first two phases of systemic racismin to a political entity that operatesunder the guise of benevolence but isactually the deliverer of oppressionokay the victim of fair state is inplaceto keep people divided in groups inbelieving that they are victims okaythat is what the victim of their statedoes and the person is taught that theyare a victim they become disempoweredand then they will seek the help ofothers in this case these former slavemasters their sustenance for support forthe basic necessities of life this isthe sad reality of the love of thevictim welfare statethe victim welfare state has destroyedneighborhoods it's destroyed familiesit's destroyed school systems and it'sfilled the prisons and it is created awhole nother level in many ways worsethan it was in the first two phases ofracial animus that needs to be defeatedbecause it's a lie people can walk awayfrom the bump from the victim welfarestate they cannot or they could not walkaway from the slave state or apartheidstate now many people on the Left arguethat there was a switch I and manyDemocrats claimed that there was aswitch I used to believe in the switchthe switch being the Democrats went fromthe party of systemic racism to civilrights and the Republicans went from theparty of civil rights to systemic racismthis is not true this is absolutely nottruenow the Republicans absolutely areculpable with systemic racism becausethrough the enforcement of the ChineseExclusion treaties the nullification ofseveral treaties of Native Americansduring the late 19th century the u.s.expansionism during the spanish-americanwarhowever the Republicans are not theprimary authors of systemic racism inthe United States excuse meas I said the damage done by the victimwelfare state is extensive it'sdestroyed school systems you have 7% ofBaltimore school children beingproficient in math and 22% beingproficient in reading scores are similarthroughout the entire country in theinner city and this is done systemicallyI believe it is because that's what hashappened now might the first cracks ofloyalty of my loyalty for the DemocratParty happened in 2011 when Eric Holderwas called to testify in front of theHouse Judiciary Committee on fast andfurious when I first heard about fastand furious I thought it was a phonyRepublican scandal as MSNBC and CNN toldme and I believed I thought it was aphony Republican scandal in order to getat the Obama administration I watchedEric Holder's testimony and it was veryclear that he was changing his story andher fears and people refusing to answerquestions now somebody's telling thetruthone doesn't refuse to answer questionsand one doesn't change the story so Iwas wondering how come he just didn'tanswer the question straight up so Grega red flag went up and Attorney GeneralHolder was reprimanded for contempt ofCongress although nothing ever came ofthat in addition to fast and furiouswhich I researched and found out to betrue which was the Obama administrationsending heavy weapons to the cartelsthere's the Solyndra scandal the IRStargeting Benghazi I can makea whole nother video on that disparaginglaw-enforcement as racist with broadprejudiced terms actually the arming ofal Qaeda Isis and the Affordable CareAct now I have read the Affordable CareAct they know that sounds insane butI've read it I read it it took me 14months the copy I had was ten thousandthree hundred pages I've heard they'rebigger versions and smaller versions Idon't know I got the one from the actualwebsite and I read it from 2013 to 2014it took me 14 months I've had 20 to 30pages a day so I know what's in theAffordable Care Act and it's a giantripoff for the Federal Reserve and acouple healthcare corporations and it'salso designed to bring in a single pairsocialist health care system so thehistory of the Democratic Party coupledwith the corruption of the Obamaadministration is why I walked away Icould no longer deny the reality of theDemocrat party's history of systemicracism the Democrat Party has neverapologized for slavery or apartheid theywill never apologize for the victimwelfare state okay now they're offeringreparations you know what in a way I amfor reparations I believe those who areconnected to organizations who hadslaves should pay who are who is thatthe Democrats take up Democrats you youare the slaveholders you owe reparationsokay don't ask Republicans to pay it'syour house[Music]people can walk away from the victimwelfare state and this is the bigdifference between the victim welfarestate and the previous two phases ofsystemic racism the slave state in theapartheid state the victim welfare statecan only oppress those who believe it'slies okay and one of the biggest why'sis if you're a person of color if you'repart of the LGBTQ community if you're awoman that you're always a victim andyou're never going to be able to shed orescape from that victimhood status thisis a lie that is not true that is nottrue people of color are succeeding inAmerica women are succeeding in Americathings aren't perfect but every singleperson can have a great life if theywork hard and use discipline so I'm gladI walked away the deep state is dominantin the Democrat Party today and it waselse it has had influence in theRepublican Party as well you can't denythat I am a supporter of the job presentTrump is doing however I am aconstitutional libertarian I am NOT aRepublican see you next time[Music]

know that he was a lifelong Democratand was little he's uneasy about his hisstuff but as this year has come on I'mactually more scared of the hate then Iwas I've ever been scared of hate andthis is why this is why I walked awaywhen in Obama's second year the hate tome was too much the identity politicswere too much do not use me for youragenda don't use me to validate yourexistence I am doing just fine as ahuman being I am doing just fine with myrights I'm doing just fine with anythingI don't have a problem with getting ajob I don't have a problem with taxes Idon't have that issue I I am so in lovewith this movement this movement meansthat the people who are like us who wereDemocrats at one point recognize theextreme extreme extreme change that thatparty has gone through have a place togo and I don't hate people that hate meI pray for them I don't want to punishpeople who hate me I pray for them Godis our deal rightnot not parties not politicians notstars not people God is the ultimatejudge and jury in my life and theDemocrats strayed so far from that theyhave strayed so far from that andthey're actually returning to the rootsthat they had back in the 30s 40s 50sand 60s and that's not okay with mesocialism doesn't work identity politicsdon't work and that the more of us thatget out there the more of us that loveour country the more of us that believethat our country is good but it has itsissues we'll succeedthere's nothing we can't do as a countrythere's nothing that we can't do but ifthese politics the liberals do it's notokay it's not okay you you inciteviolence when you incite violencenothing gonna come with that when youpit one side against the other and I'mnot saying the Republicans are you knowscot-free of this what I'm saying isthat if there's more people like us whodon't care about any of that stuff themore smart decisions will be made alongparty lines if you give us a moderatewhere moderate Democrat I probably votefor them if they had the right thing butif you're gonna go so far left and tellme that socialism is great I'm gonna saygo to Venezuela I'm not I'm not actuallywhen I think better I'm not actually uhI'm a Republican but I have this socialRepublican part of me where everythingsocially is okay and then all thisliberal garbage is not okay so I I justlove the fact that this walkawaymovement is so big what gets soimpressive and I'm so glad that I'm hereand I think that everyone in this grouphas such good things to say and that ifwe can get the word out it's gonna beamazingI where I make America Greta hat againor make America great hat and I don'teven mind no one's bothered me no onespit on me because America is greatwe're greatand when we get to the voter box and saythat he may not be the best like posterboy for that but the phrase is awesomeand what he's doing is awesome and thereare times when he is a douche bag and Iget thatbut for the most part my taxes are cutEPA's cut government is getting smallerI'm cool and the Democrats have shiedaway from it their hate is so strong andthe hate is the biggest issue for mewhen you start yelling at people thatyou're a racist homophobic person whenyou're not because I've even actuallybeen called that I'm not a racistI'm absolutely obviously not homophobicand when you've been called that becauseof something you believe in that's whenI walk awayI want to talk about my

even actuallybeen called that I'm not a racistI'm absolutely obviously not homophobicand when you've been called that becauseof something you believe in that's whenI walk away
what's up guys I'm making this videobecause it's the hashtag walkawaymovement that I've been participating inI was in it on Twitter but apparentlythe mainstream media has beendiscrediting in it and saying it's aRussian bot thing and there's no meritto it at all like there's absolutelynobody leaving the Democratic Partywhich who in their right mind couldbelieve that anyway I'm glad that it'son YouTube now because it's kind of hardto discredit and say it's Russian BOTSwhen there's a face and a voice thatgoes with it so I want to talk to youguys about when I actually walked awaywhich I feel like is probably the samething as red pill moment right that'sprobably the same thing but anyway sowhen I walked away from the DemocraticParty actually let me rewind a littlebit more because I was never actually aDemocrat I was never a Democrat I wasalways a moderate same with my parentsthey're both moderate you know I justkind of grew up in that householdbelieves in hard work personalresponsibility never took handoutsnothing was ever handed to me I'vealways you know worked for everythingI've had so oft a pie already feel likeI couldn't be a Democrat just because Iknew that they were the party of likewelfare and you know handouts and theircare about the poor which you know it'snot like I don't care about poor butit's also like you don't work you don'teat right so that's always been mystance on it but I would say the momentthat I decided to walk away was afterthe election after the election ofDonald Trump now I voted for Obama Ivoted for him twice I'm not gonna lie Ivoted for the first black president as ablack man and my first time voting I'mnot like I'm not going to not gofor the first black president I mean isan easy decision his second term howeverI felt like I paid more attention towhat he was doing and like what he saidif he had kept his promises from hisfirst term but I still gave him the nodover Mitt Romney because I had been toldmy whole life that Republicans areracist they don't like black people andthey only care about rich people and Iwas lacking not rich so again no-brainervote for Obama so I voted for Obamaagain and then when the 2016 electioncame around that's what I really waskind of forced to look at politicsbecause at that point I'm done withcollege I'm out in the real world I'mworking so I'm thinking like alright howdoes a Republican in office affect mylife personally and I knew that HillaryClinton was corrupt and I just didn'tside with either candidate and where Iwas living at the time a super blue cityminneapolis very democratic extremelyprogressive i had never lived in a citylike that i lived in a place where itwas people didn't really get intopolitics and all that but minneapoliswas extremely Hillary Clinton buryingfar left and that's where I encounteredlike social justice warriors and youknow free speech was kind of shunned upthere you know it's kind of free speechon crutches up there you know theyreally didn't want you speaking freely Iguess and those are there were thingsthat were already kind of had me pullingaway from the Democratic Party eventhough I voted Democrat I neverconsidered myself a Democrat I just kindof allow myself to be indoctrinated bysome of that ideology and rhetoric butafter Donald Trump won everyone was kindof losing their minds it was likeChicken Little the sky is falling oh mygod everything's falling apart America'soffer we're gonna be a war with NorthKorea you're going back to Africathey're gonna ship everyone out of thecountry I just kind of like realized manthere's none of what thereor motion then there is logic with theleft there's really not a lot of logicthere's not a lot of critical thinkingthere's not a lot of just common senseand I found myself gravitating furtherand further away from the left so atthis point I feel like I was walkingaway from the left slowly but stilllooking at the left like all right maybethings will normalize after that youknow initial shock sets in after it'sdone after the after the initial shockhas passed people will get on get onwith their life because you know it'sone president how much could how muchimpact if one president have on millionsand millions of people well to mysurprise apparently a lot because theyhave been in Trump derangement syndromegoing on two years now like they haven'tstopped it's been radical social justicemovement after radical social justicemovement you know I saw a lot of thingswith the left that I just did not alignwith it all and the more that I learnedabout Donald Trump the more I saw likethe media's been lying about him andthey've been lying to me about who I amand what my worldview should be you knowI really used to think seeing it was atrusted news source I really actuallythought that they were centrist and thatthey didn't craft narratives and thatthey didn't try to indoctrinate anyonecome to find out that's exactly whatthey were doing they were telling me alot of things like you know it's openseason on black men and I should watchmy back but nothing about my life evermade me believe that I was a victim orthat you know I couldn't supportDemocrats yet they were are Republicansyet they were telling me I couldn'tsupport Republicans you know I saw thathow many times they lied on Donald Trumpthey lied about how many people were athis inauguration they lied about himpouring like fish food into the koi pondwhen he went over to I think it wasJapan you know I saw a lot of pettyactions coming from the mainstream mediaHollywood you know Democrats friends onFacebook and social media I just saw alot of things that made me realize howradical the left truly was and so Ifully walked away and the more than Ilearned about Donald Trump and startedseeing some of the success of hispresidency and I saw they wouldn't evengive him credit for some of the stuffthat he was doing so you know I justI found myself not only walking awayfrom the left but like outrightrebelling from the left so you know nowthat I see the light and I seeeverything clearly I feel it's like myduty to kind of bring others to thatlight because there's a lot of peoplethat are still buying into thatpropaganda all the hyperbolic rhetoricthat's used day in and day out all thelies that they're spreading how they areconflating arguments how they arebasically painting every Donald Trumpsupporter with a broad brush you knowanytime there's a pro Trump rallythey're saying it's a white supremacistrally you know they're saying anyonethat wears an American flag or flies anAmerican flag or wears a make Americagreat again hat on which I have they'rebasically saying that that's racist thenthat those people are Nazis well I feellike it's my duty to shatter thatnarrative to shatter the narrative thatminorities can't support Donald Trumpand all Republicans are racist you knowI live in Florida now I don't live inMinnesota I live in a pro Trump proudAmerican patriotic Republican state andthe more that I'm around Republicans andwhite people and people that vote forDonald Trump the more I see that themedia has duped me they have bamboozledme to have bamboozled so many otherpeople to believe that we shouldn'tsupport this president because he's fullof racism and I'm like looking at itvery objectively you know I'm looking atCNN's argument I'm looking at FoxNewsargument I've also found YouTube youknow I obviously have my own channel nowbut I started out after his electiongoing for independent media sources youknow instead of the mainstream mediaafter I found out the mainstream mediawas a businessI looked into stuff for myself and Idecided I'm gonna you know think formyself and be clear minded when Iapproach things and it's honestly beenthe greatest thing ever so I can proudlysay that I've walked away from the leftand no for anybody that's gonna troll inthe comment section it's not aboutrunning away from the left and going tothe rightI stand independent I am an independentthinker if you have to label me assomething label me some label melibertarian because I am all aboutpersonal responsiveindividual liberty non-aggressiveprinciple I believe in the Constitutionand I've loved America I'm proud I'mpatriotic and I love the president Ilove everything that he's doing you knowand I'll hold him accountable he doessomething I don't like but I'm alsogoing to give him credit when he doessomething right and that's somethingthat we're not seeing on the leftthey've just gone so far into theirTrump derangement syndrome that seemslike we're past the point of no returnso by default I guess I'm with the otherside you know but more importantly thanthat walking away from the left was thegreatest decision I've made in my lifeone of the greatest decisions I made inmy life because for once I'm thinkingfor myself I see myself as anindependent you know someone who makesdecisions for themselves someone that'snot going to be indoctrinated by somenarrative and that's my story guys so Inever really was on the Left I justdecided I don't belong there and walkingaway from them was pretty easy becausethey were going in the oppositedirection from the beginning let me knowwhat you guys think in the commentssection like share subscribe let me knowwhat your walkaway movement is or yourwalkaway moment was and I'll catch youguys in the next video
hi my name is Kristy Cox this is more ofa walk with story than a walk away storybut I want to talk to you about somehard things tonight I want to talk aboutracism I was born in 1953 in a smallsouthern town the citizens the blackcitizens of our town lived in their ownarea so I was raised sacred thatsegregated there were no black people atmy church the black kids had their ownschool and it wasn't until I was inseventh grade that the schools wereintegrated now because it was a culturedifference and I want to explain thisbecause I was raised in a very racistenvironment my daddy was very racist allof my family were Democrats all of thepeople in my town who had any influencewhatsoever were Democrats and it took mea long time to see because I was justborn into it and I was a kid but I canremember when I was a little girl thatmy daddy would say bad things aboutblack people and as a child in my heartI knew it wasn't right I didn'tunderstand it all all I can remember ata very young age was thinking to myselfI'm so glad I'm not black because theneverybody would hate me so believe me Iwas born into that kind of attitude andenvironment I didn't have it myself butI didn't have enough experience toreally know what I was thinkinguntil the schools were integrated and Igot to be friendswith black kids they were angry whenthey came to school because whathappened was they shut down their blackschool and made them come to the whiteschool in town so they did not like thatand they were mad and I could understandit but it was still it was a hard fewyears but what I want people tounderstand is those of us I was born in1953 is the 60s when we had you knowracial equality started and those of uswho were raised especially in the southand small towns we had to work atknowing how to live together and I cantell you that in seventh grade when theschools were integrated by ninth gradepretty much all of us kids were friendswe had black friends white friends itwas a couple of years for cultures to tomail together at school but it didhappen and I can tell you that of allthe friends that I have that are my agenow in their 60snone of them are racist we areconstantly being it for white we'rebeing called racist and I can tell you Ican feel I can feel that just out in theworld going to work and go into the mallor whatever the looks that I get fromblack people or telling me that they dohate they hate white and we've got tostop this I can tell you that all of uswho grew up in the 60s we've worked atgetting rid of racism we worked ateverybody getting along and we werethere until Obama became president andhe started throwing the race card outthere and I could see the difference outin society I could see it somehow we'vegot to get together now this walk awaycampaignI joined it as soon as I saw it and themain reason I joined it was because allof the videos were giving me hope Iworry about socialism this country Iworry about terrorism I worry about mygrandchildren growing up in a freecountry that I grew up in and when I waspretty young I realized I was aRepublican when I when I turned 19 theyhad changed the voting age to 18 so Iwent down to register the food I knewnothing about politics my mother told meto graduate serve Democrat so I did atthe time I didn't understand what thatmeant and it was later one day whensomehow this paper landed in my hand andit told the differences between theDemocratic Party and the RepublicanParty on key issues and as I read thatpaper I realized that on the Republicanside I agreed with all the - on theDemocrat side I disagreed with all the -so in my heart I said maybe I'm aRepublican well I had an older sisterand she was a Republican I didn't reallyknow what that meant and we had neverreally talked politics but I called hershe lived in upstate New York I calledher and I told her about reading thatpaper and she's the one that helped mework through my beliefs and thoughts todecide if I was conservative or liberalI'm definitely conservative and thankyou God I raised my children that wayand they agree with me and all of mygrandchildren so when we all gettogether we're on the same pagepolitically and that makes it reallynice I only have a few friends that areliberal and they're not very nice someof them right now though aren't sayingmuch so I'm wondering if they're havingthoughts that I just want to say I lovethis warm-up wake campaign and I reallythink that the two things that I justrealized the slightly the two things ofcommonality in this walkaway campaign itdoesn't have anything to do with colorit has to do with love and patriotism ifyou have love in your heart and wantmore love in the world and if you lovethis country then you fit right in tothis walkaway campaign and I really havea lot of hope that the walkaway campaignwill bring more and more people from theleft to the right when they realize thatthe left right now does not representany love at all for this country or andthey're all there supporting andsocialism they're gonna ruin the countryand I'm hoping that did people thenmaybe just sorta wake it will wake upand come to come home come home to theplace of patriotism and love well thanksfor hearing my story[Music]
hello everyone I come to you from thegreat white north Canada I hope it'sokay to share a video with you I justwanted to go over kind of what I see asa more global movement really we seethis in Europe America hopefully willstart seeing more of in Canada theWestern world more generally wherepeople are rejecting the leftist Marxistessentially doctrine that has saturatedso many political systems I feel withsome degree of certainty that the battlewill be waged across the globe if it hasto I across Western countries I shouldsay but the war will be fought inAmerica what happens in America is goingto affect all of us and Canada isalready quite affected by Americanpolitics we not just trade but we'rekind of saturated with it here I'd wagera lot of Canadians actually know moreabout your political system then theyknow about Canadian political systemwhich is depressing probably part of thereason why we're in the currentpredicament so we don't have the samekind of pride that Americans do of theircountry our own Prime Minister actuallydidn't say that we have no inherentCanadian values no inherent culture or apost national country which I don't knowI never signed on to say that I'm proudof my roots here I've I've had directancestors in this country since beforeit was a country 18:06 is the furthest Ican trace my ancestry back to NewBrunswick which was at that point aBritish colony of some nature yeah sohearing that and then that the incomingimmigrants have warmer right to thiscountryor not more of a right but they're moredeserving of it I think is what he saidbecause they chose to come here whereasI was me and so many other generationsof Canadians whether they're white orbrown or black or whatever that hasnothing to do with it they were bornhere and they don't matter like I'm notopposed to immigration in the slightestit would be super hypocritical of me tobe opposed really um by it and you knowI know plenty of immigrants who comehere and they put in the work and I finda lot of them are really frustrated atthe fact that we have hundreds of peoplecoming in every day coming across theborder and claiming asylum here becauseTrump is cracking down on false refugeeclaimants or people who've overstayed insome nature and so they're coming hereas a second choice and they're gonnaleech off of our system and Trudeau isgonna let them get away with it and Idon't know who he thinks is gonna payfor it because if you add more peoplebut you know I'm not hopeful that a lotof these people are gonna be payingtaxes the same rate that you know gooddecent citizens do I'm a little bitafraid to kind of say exactly what Ifeel about immigration just because wedon't have free speech in this countryand I'm a little it's a little difficultfor me to keep up with the things thatare and are not permitted to say so I'lljust say that if you have a piece ofpizza or a whole pizza and you have 80people everyone gets a slice of runshappy if you have one pizza and a bp80people everyone gets a tiny littleportion and we all go home hungry so Ilove my country I'm a patriot I love mycountry I don't want it to continue downthe current path I want to save it undereverything I can this is the country myI have ancestors that fought in wars onbehalf of this country they fought forthe freedoms that I havethat are being eroded away and it's allbeing done under the guise of democracyand we need to do something becausewe're at the stage now where the commonpeople people like you and me are beingdivided up they're being divided up fornefarious purposes and they're beingdivided so that we'll be too busyfighting each other that we can't fightthe elite that's what happens if you goon my facebook profile you may know thatI studied in Russia for a bit I despitethat I'm not a Russian bot I'm aCanadian anyway so there's I don't wantto say like a conspiracy but there'ssomething rotten in the state of Denmarkthat's what I'll say that this is beingshoved down everyone's throats that thiscountry it would have been unthinkable acouple years ago to see the NationalPost running an article about howthere's systemic sexism and just arampant discrimination in our societythat because what it's not true itwasn't true and now it's commonplaceit's been imported it's being forced onus and we are being turned against eachother so as I was saying with regards toRussiaI study Russia just cultural studieslanguage linguistics to an extent inhistory I also studied Germany I chosethose two because ultimately I aminterested in the question of how peoplecan get into a state where they hateeach other enough to commit atrociousacts is it hate or is it that they justdon't see each other as equals I've cometo the conclusion that it's the latter Iknow all about the Persians I know allabout what happens when the Communiststake over I know about the Holocaust Iknow about the pogroms I know about theArmenian Genocide theregenocide the genocide in Bosnia Serbiaetc Yugoslavia Cambodia I know aboutChina I know about the experimentationunits in Japan by the Japanese army Iknow about all of these things and thething is is that when you start puttingpeople into boxes that are pittedagainst each othereveryone who was caught in the middle isthe first to go when they were killingpeople in Rwanda it was the Hutus themoderate Hutus were among the first todie along with the Tutsis and I don'tsay that to freak anyone out I just saythat because I know a lot about thetopic I've always been rather interestedin this question of why people howpeople could come to these kinds ofbeliefs and now I'm kind of seeingexamples of this unfolding in real timeI'm not saying we're all gonna be on thestreets killing each other in the matterof I don't wouldn't even have a timeperiod for you if that was gonna happenI don't think that will happen I amsaying that it could I am saying that ifthere's a time to reach out and talk topeople and understand them and not putthem take them out of the boxes andstand next to them not against them nowis the time now is the time to startspeaking out because anything I finallyI've been so worried about doingsomething like this because I didn'twant to ruin my reputation so to speak Ididn't want consequences like whathappened to Lindsay Shepard because I dowant to work in academia I didn't wantthat to happen but then I was thinkinglike if I don't say anything and iteverything does go to [ __ ] myreputations not gonna matter so I havemore lose from staying quiet than I haveto lose from speaking out so I've mademy decisionhelp other people make that decisionDoug Ford I was elected in Ontario hewas built by the media's being likeKatie and Trump which is completegarbage but that beside yeah I hopethat's a sign that things are turningaroundand I just want to say protect yourrights in America you have somethingthat we don't you have freedom of speechand you have every single beautifulpoint and Amendment in your Constitutionthat you should cherishdon't let the American Dream die I knowyou won't and I wish the best for bothof our countries going forward pleaseknow that we have nothing againstAmericans up

hello walk away folks I know I said thatI was not going to do a video becauseI'm a very private personthat being said I'm doing this onYouTube on my own channel so I have alittle bit more control of what getswhere my story though I have written itit's relatively simple I never walkedaway from anything I was never a left era writer a Republican a Democrat I don'teven think I would call myselfindependent what I can say is that I wasfor the truth the truth was the onlything I ever thought and I never gavepolitics much thought to be honest so mystory as you all read is like I saidfairly simple so I'm just gonna gothrough it again very very quickly myfamily and I my parents maternalgrandparents and I legally immigratedhere 28 years ago from the former SovietUnion which now is Belarus the countryof my birth anyways um I am fluent inRussian and English I do not understandBelarusian at all we left due toanti-semitism and religious persecutionwe were pretty much kicked out of thecountry for wanting to leave and webecame what I like to call citizens ofthe world for a very long time afterlegally again immigrating to the Stateswe had a visa and I went to school myparents worked my grandparents rightaway got Social Security because theywere of the age and um less than adecade after becoming or coming here weall became citizens because I was underthe age of 18 I became a citizen as soonas my parents did so they had toactually pass the test and the test wasvery very simple just basic historyclass material my funniest memory isactually chasing my mother around afterwork with the papers because I was juststudying that in like the seventh gradeis when they took the exam and maybelike mom what's the stoppage on thestripes on the flag me and she's like ohgo away go away I'm tired I'm tiredneedless to say they still passed theexam but that was just a fond memory ofmine around the time that this electionwas getting underway you know all thecandidates and whatnot um we knew prettymuch that we were not going to voteDemocrat I was actually thinking aboutBernie for a while up until I heard thathe was pushing the socialism crap andsocialism for those who do not know isthe introduction of communism nowconsidering we just left a communistcountry even though it did fall apartnot like a lot changed ya know soconsidering there was like 17 candidateson the Republican side and like 11 onthe the Democrat side we didn't know whothe heck we were gonna vote for once itwas narrowed down then we decided okayTrump it is we also like the fact thathe was a businessman and the firstbusinessman in office you know otherthan Reagan being an actor we liked thefact of his speeches and his truths andhis honesty and the fact that he was notbasically was not bought by the whomeveris in charge of this junk so he cannotbe bought basically also one moment alsoas I mentioned in what I had previouslywritten though I am Pro environment andobviously Pro saving the environmentsaving the oceans all that stuff I'mvery glad we left the EPA because had wenot uh it would have just kept drainingus of money andwe are trillions of dollars in debtalready had Hillary Clinton one myfamily would have had to run againbecause this country would have turnedinto exactly what we're seeing right nowfrom the media which is hate and thiswhole crazy Nazi rhetoric which isscaring the crap out of us given that weare Jews and we have lost 67 members inthe Holocaust so basically anything ofthis kind of 1930s Germany scaring thecrap out of all of us so I actuallyjoined this campaign on a whim I sawBrandon's video and I thought it hadtruth in it now if you remember from thestart of this video I said that I wasPro truth and that's really the onlypolitical side that I'm on I'm Pro truthso when I saw the video I was like wowthis is very powerfulso let me join this group and see whatit is but I don't join lots of groupsI'm literally in sixand so I joined the group andimmediately what struck me was that thestories people told were basically likemy my own not the leaving or the notleaving but how they were treated bytheir friends sometimes by their familysometimes by their co-workers being ableto talk openly and feel comfortableenough and then people's responses thethe positivity the kindness the caringand remembering how much my own friendsgranted I will say my own friends forthe most part the other side or whateverside all sides have been kind andgenerous and wonderful there were a fewexceptions which I lost and that's wherethe poetry sharing came in those of youwho read my poems in the beginning alittle bit more about myself I'm 34years old I live in Stamford Connecticutall 28 years living in this countrywe've lived in Connecticut I'm reallytired of thisand not just because it's a blue statebut just in general it's a very veryexpensive state and as I told someonerecently my favorite colors blue but notwhen it pertains to politics um my dogalso by the way voted for trouble so theother thing about me is that I am a PhDstudent I'm almost halfway done with mydegree I'm doing it through theUniversity of the Rockies in DenverColorado online it's actually harder todo your PhD online that it is in regularyou know the five to seven years to geta business doctorate um my goals to be acollege professor and teach businesswith the better managers out in theworldthe other thing about me for fun I liketo scuba dive I am a certified diver Iam a writer not just of poetry I havedifferent genres the poetry part somepublished some is not my hair looksabsolutely a mess in this video I don'tknow what happened to it's like as soonas I decided to turn this record thisvideo my hair just went oh[Music]some of you might have noticed my verydry sense of humoranother very important part of aboutmyself is that I have a incurable anduntreatable disease called myalgicencephalomyelitis and the CDC's name toit is chronic fatigue syndrome which isa name we're trying to reversethat there's a lot going on the diseasebasically I was bedridden for two yearscompletely and I nearly lost my life Istopped breathing and I became a walkingtalking miracle so I'm basically uh Iguess a beacon of hope for those in theEmme community as myalgicencephalomyelitis is called as M II it'sa lot easier than saying that a littlething Emme effects 1 million people inAmerica that's the estimate and about 17million worldwide which is more than ALSand MS combined and yet it has beenlately buried buried I'm sorry by theCDC for the last 30 years now to worryI'm fighting that too so that's prettymuch me if you guys are interested inmore of my work that's you know poetryother stuff let me know I will linkthings mostly I don't use my channel onYouTube much anymore just because my dogkind of took over it uh-huh and I justam very thankful for all of you caringkind cool people that um just make it avery interesting place to chat andwithout name-calling or BS or whateverI've never seen that much name-callingin my life what's going on now so Ireally hope that that stops soon becauseI'm really getting tired of 1930sGermany in the United States in 2018 wedon't need another one of that you knowlosing 67 members in the Holocaust forour family and just recently finding outthat some of those were in Auschwitz isnot something we want to go throughagain because you know it's just it'sit's very uncool I'm putting it mildlyI'm how I have a hard time talkingbecause I do have the cognitive issuesand stuff so I would I know I'm waving Ijust have people coming in here everytwo seconds so just again thank youeveryone for your kindness and your justah being able to speak freely freespeech right First Amendment

hi everybody my name is Beth and I wantto tell you a little bit about my storyI'm not actually a walk away unless youwant to count walking away from RhinoRepublicans and I'm definitely one ofthose never been a Democrat although Idid vote once for a Democrat and Ilearned my lesson a long time ago thoughthey're not the right people to vote formy first election that I voted in forthe presidentwas mixed up so that was quite a whileago I voted for Carter I believed thatwas the first time I learned about howmuch propaganda there is and how muchyou are swayed to vote for a certainperson or a certain party Carter is oneof the worst presidents we ever had as amatter of fact I would put him as theworst president until Obama came along Iwas raised a Republican a veryconservative household we wereChristians so if you were a Democrat youweren't just a Democrat you were a dirtyDemocrat in my household so I was raisedalready not agreeing with anything thatthe Democrats said my parents were verypolitical they talked a lot and welearned a lot - it wasn't just that Ithought all Democrats were bad and allDemocrat policies were bad but wediscussed things and I enjoyed that evenour friends that were Democrats orpeople that we went to church with orwhateverwe'd have good healthy debate we'd havegood healthy discussion in those daysyou could actually vote for a Democratand it was okay because the value systemwas still on the surface basically thesame that of course has changed a lotI've watched politics ago from goodhealthy arguments to insane violence andvery violent retic rhetoric and hatredandlike that at all I understand that we'reall different and it is okay for thoseof us to have different points of viewit's okay to have different lifestylechoices it's okay to have differentpolitical goals and hopes I'm okay withthatI really am I think it's great it's whatmakes us Americans if it's actually whatmakes us really free that we can havedifferences that we don't ollie you knowand I almost think the Democrats remindme of that book a wrinkle in time I'msure many of you have read it butthere's one particular scene that hasstayed with me all my life and I readthat book as a child and that's one whenthe kids walk out on the front porch orthe front yard and they're all bouncingthe ball exactly the same but ever Ithink was a red ball they're allbouncing it exactly the same in the onechild who bounced differentlyit was severely punished that's wherethe Democrats are today if you do notwalk in lockstep with them then you areharshly punished we've seen so muchviolence we've seen so much ugly speechwe've seen broken relationshipswe're told you know how bad we are aspeople were called all kinds of uglynames I don't want to be a part of thatand even though you know I'm one ofthose Republicans that suffers frombattered conservative syndrome you knowwe've loaded all these people in andwhat have we gotten for it nothing I'mreally happy to see the currentdirection that Trump is taking thisnation and the values that he's tryingto reinstate and all of that so eventhough I didn't really know anythingabout him before he ran other than hewas a billionaire playboy that had a TVshow and blah blah blah you know once wewent through the whole election processwith all the candidateshe was the clear winner there's no nodoubt about it but yet am I stillbattered conservative you know what isit betterconservative syndrome sorry that's whatI was saying he is doing far more than Iever even half expected or hoped for Ican't believe we actually have a manwho's doing what he said he was going todo so I'm very happy to be part of thiscampaign I'm very happy to be part ofthis group I love hearing everybody'sstories it is amazing to me how such weare truly a diverse group we are peoplefrom all walks of life all ages allcolors all erases all religions alleverything and yet there's such lovehere and I love that so even if I maynot agree with your life story tolifestyle choices that's okay it's okayyou have the freedom to do that and youhave the freedom to allow me to choosemy lifestyle choices which happened tobe white anglo the Protestant Christianyou know with a little hallelujah praisethe Lord's thrown in so thank you guysthank you for this community thank youfor opening it to even those of us thatdidn't necessarily walk away from theDemocrats but we walked away from theRhinos so god bless you allbye-bye
hi everyone um a little nervous I wantedto make this video because I wanted toexplain why I have decided not to votefor Democrats probably ever again I aman independent voter I'm unaffiliatednot part of any party and I feel like Iam the demographic that the Democratsshould be trying to get but it seemslike they're only trying to go for theirradical base I am NOT a feminist andit's just seems like if you're not afeminist the Democrats don't really seemto be talking to you it has kind of seemto be regurgitating feminist points I'mjust not interested in so I amembarrassed to say this but I waswatching CNN and MSNBC during theelection and not that it's okay toinsult President Trump because I don'tagree with that either but what reallycaught my eye was when it was just thisrelentless attack on Trump supporterscalling them racists everything racistxenophobic transphobic bigots just it'spretty much calling them stupid thisword is relentless insults and I waslooking at the TV and I was seeing hisrallies there were so many people thereand so eventually this I just felt theywere being so abusive to these you knowto the Trump supporters so I decided oneday that I was going to go on my phoneto try to you know get to know Trumpsupporters know why they support himbecause I just couldn't believe itthese thousands millions of people werelike pretty much what the media wastelling me were the worst people in theworldI just thought there's no way that thatcould be true so then I went online andI just wasso angry when I have looked at thousandsand thousands of hours of just differentTrump supporters and saying why theyspecifically decide to vote for himbecause all of them have their differentreasons and they were such nice peoplethey were smart they were kind they wereloving they were extremely well-informedand they were actually making argumentsthey weren't just name-calling becauseyou know new / - a lot of peoplename-calling is on an argument callingsomebody racists and bigots it's not anargument it it makes me sad that clearlycollege is failing us because I'm I mydoctorate so I'm a college educatedperson and I'm embarrassed to be rightnow because for some reason a lot ofcollege-educated people thinkname-calling is some sort of argumentand it's gonna get people on your sidejust because you're screaming racistevery five minutes so - you know to behonest with you I saw and I was so angryhow much I was lied to by the mediabecause the Trump supporters were notanything like what they told me theywere so I just I then I went down therabbit hole and I started finding outhow much they've lied to me my wholelife how much the media is lighting mywhole life I know people think I'm sillybecause they probably known this for along time unfortunately I have mydoctorate but you can be intelligent butnot wise so I realized I had a veryhumble experience realizing that I wasnot wise I got so angry I cut my cable Iwill never watch the mainstream mediaagain I get my news from independentmedia and I'm so much smarter than Iever have been much more awake than Iever have been and honest and much morefree than I ever have been um to termsupporters I am so sorry for even in thesmallest way if I contributed to yourabuse because I do feel like the mediaverbally abuses you non-stop I am sosorry for anypart I took in that um I I may notdeserve forgiveness because you guyshave been treated so badly but I hope Ican earn it by being better and doingbetter and I promise I will be betterand I will do better I don't think itmatters who you vote for you shouldnever be abused verbally abusedphysically attacked just because of youhave a different opinion or because youvoted for Bernie or Hillary or Trump ora third party this is not how it shouldbe in this country and you know thatother thing too is with the you knowillegal illegal immigration I see thesepeople you know more of the radical leftdemanding demand demanding that peopletreat them with kindness compassion andgrace you need to start doing thatGerman American citizens because you arenot treating your American citizens withkindness compassion and grace as you'renot doing that to people that supportTrump you're treating them like garbageso don't demand that people treatillegal immigrants with kindness untilyou start doing that short Americancitizens that's my thoughts on that andI just makes me sick that these peopleare demanding that when they're soabusive to their own pool um I just I'mjust very sorry and I I hope that thisplatform can bring freedom to people totalk to who they want to vote for whothey want without people unfriendingthem their family cutting them off thisis not how this should be people areallowed to have their different opinionswithout being called all every name inthe book so for that reason for the gistof it away to the Trump supporters havebeen treated I didn't vote for Trump soI don't know people think that you knowjust say I didn't vote for him I am verypleased with how he's doing I am veryvery pleased and surprised with how wellhe's doing so I will say that I dorespect our president I respected everypresident I wasn't a fan of

hii'm danielle hall and i walked away fromthe democrat party in 2017.my father was stationed in doverdelaware in 1973 where i grew upand as i grew older and closer to thevoting agewe had spirited conversations about whowe were voting for as a familyso by the time i turned 18 it wasnatural for me to register the same waymy parents were which was democrat and istayed that way for manydecades in 2016 i actuallyhad the opportunity to help a republicancandidateand so as i traveled with him up anddown the state of delawareand talk to voters about things that hestood fori started to really see that people werewilling to have open honestconversations about voting their valuesand not their party affiliations soaround the beginning of 2017i decided to do a deeper dive andtechnology being what it is i wentonlinefound two or three different types ofpolitical personalinventories and i took the test now someof them were 20 some were 40 some were60 questionsbut at the end of the day i always endedup being conservativeand so that made a lot of sense to mebecauseas a mom i see thatthere are some things that my partyaffiliation didn't serve me as ademocrat with the education systemas a veteran and pro-second amendmenti saw that my values also didn't alignwith my party affiliationand as a small business owner i saw thatthere was a huge disparity inwhere i worked and what my partyaffiliation was and so in a lot of waysthe democrat party walked away from melong before i walked awayfrom it in 2018 i was socharged up about changing some thingshere in the political landscapeof delaware that i decided to run forstate senateand again here in 2020 i find myselfin the throes of running for officeagain and this time i'm runningstatewide as lieutenant governorand i'm still charging the voters withthe challengeof really doing that deep dive andseeing where they alignwith things that i'm talking about in myplatformand where they're affiliated sometimesit doesn't always match up and i'mencouraging themto plant that own seed and and theirpoliticaluh ideologies and and decide that theywant to votetheir values and not their partyaffiliationsso we're continuing to have those robustconversationsand i would say to anybody who'slistening to this videoto make sure you do your homework onyour candidates and vote your valuesthank you so much for listeningyou
hello so I wanted to put my story outthere I walked away from the DemocraticParty probably know I know exactly whenit was it was when everything happenedin Ferguson my biggest reason that Iwalked away

liberalviews I also hold a lot of conservativeviews and my experience in walking awayand I guess taking the red pill as it ishas been very difficult as my family hasshunned me due to my views not being onthe same level as theirs and it's reallyhard to be called a racist and a sexistand other horrible names by the peoplewho raised you because your views don'talign with theirs and to really see

because my views aredifferent from theirs doesn't make meever want to go back to that party so Iam at this point a registered Republicanonly because in the state of Florida youhave to be a Republican or a Democratvote in state and other like primariesand stuff but I think the biggest reasonI walked away with Ferguson was I saw aseparation in this in the left which isno longer accountability there is nomore self accountability for the leftit's it's all groupthink it's all thishive mind like existence they are evenstarting to shun their own people iftheir views even stray a little bitthey're

becauseObama I had done us wrong I fell for hishope and change and you know I alwayssay that he left me hopeless and theonly thing that changed was my politicalaffiliation so Thank You Obama for thatyou do deserve credit for that many ofus X Democrats do but my only issue forgetting involved politically as alifelong Democrat was Obama care havingto pay that health care penalty on topof the taxes I was already pain wascriminal to me and having to pay apenalty because I didn't buy agovernment product didn't seem likeAmerica to me anymore I also startedfeeling like there was a change in youknow how people reacted to things like Icouldn't ask for a black pen withoutbeing like well just give my black penI'm like it's just the black pen I'm notbeing racist and I always kid aroundlike that because I literally could notcriticize Obama without being called aracist I just thought that was theoddest thingI didn't know that there was so muchhappening when he said he wanted totransform this country he really did andwe're still you know two years latertrying to get back to America againwhere we're not so divided it's like alike a mass public exorcism and manthose progresses andliberal Obama lovers still putting up afight but anyways I'm a first generationAmerican and I've always said I'mAmerican my nationality is American whenpeople would asked me during theelection why or how could you vote forTrump as a Latina what has he offeredfor the Latinos and I would always saywell you know when he says that he'sgonna do X Y Z for Americans I includemyself in that and it seemed like theDemocrats were the only ones that wantedto dissect me and separate me into allthese different categories you knowfemale latina first generation parentsfrom Mexican nationals so that means Igotta be for you know everybody comingin coming in illegally and not followingthe laws but it would so oh the onlypeople that have ever ever made me feelless than what I am which is anAmericans are the Democrats so everytime Trump would say you know I'm gonnado X Y Z for America I included myselfin it I will never forget the momentwhere I said you know what I'm gonna geton that Trump train it was I just on theTrump train I'm not gonna become aRepublican I'm just gonna switch youknow party affiliation to vote for Trumpit was you know when they were callinghim Hitler and all this stuff and forwhatever he said about the rapist thatare coming in from Mexico I was neveroffended he was speaking the truth Ilive in a border state and I know itgoes on the border so he was speakingthe truth not all illegals that arecoming in from the border are criminalsbut a good percentage of them are theborder has changed so I didn'tunderstand what all this outrage wasaboutI didn't realize how in the pocket ofthe media the Democratic Party waseither so I was just you know blown awayby all the propaganda and I knew enoughto say you know Hitler the one thing hedidn't have for him was the mediapushing his propaganda just like theDemocrats so anyway so when he kickedout Jorge Ramos from one of the pressconferences because Jorge Ramos wasbeing a child and didn't want to waithis turn or had his turn in wanted moretime I said oh my god tomorrow it's overfor him you know the process comingafter him everybody's coming after himbecause you you don't do that to JorgeRamos you know he's like the you knowhe's he's just held in this greatposition in the Latino community and Isaid it's over for trial his campaign isover and the next day he kept going hewent back down and I said that's why Iwant as president he's a man with ballsthat's what we need and someone who'snot going to cower just because you knowthe media saying XYZ so that's when Igot on the Trump train but I'll tell youwhen I finally walked away and it's beenin pieces but this is a memory Iremember is watching the San Jose rallyon television and watching I mean Iclose my eyes and I can still see theimages and there they still upset mebecause this is not the America that Igrew up in but watching them egg a womanwatching them scream it you knowfamilies holding their babies in theirarmsand the worst what was the arrow viewaerial view of a white kid skinny whitekid I'll never forget itrunning around and and being chased likehe was prey no police aroundand all this and bloody people you

that and it seemed like theDemocrats were the only ones that wantedto dissect me and separate me into allthese different categories you knowfemale latina first generation parentsfrom Mexican nationals so that means Igotta be for you know everybody comingin coming in illegally and not followingthe laws but it would so oh the onlypeople that have ever ever made me feelless than what I am which is anAmericans are the Democrats so everytime Trump would say you know I'm gonnado X Y Z for America I included myselfin it I will never forget the momentwhere I said you know what I'm gonna geton that Trump train it was I just on theTrump train I'm not gonna become aRepublican I'm just gonna switch youknow party affiliation to vote for Trumpit was you know when they were callinghim Hitler and all this stuff and forwhatever he said about the rapist thatare coming in from Mexico I was neveroffended he was speaking the truth Ilive in a border state and I know itgoes on the border so he was speakingthe truth not all illegals that arecoming in from the border are criminalsbut a good percentage of them are theborder has changed so I didn'tunderstand what all this outrage wasaboutI didn't realize how in the pocket ofthe media the Democratic Party waseither so I was just you know blown awayby all the propaganda and I knew enoughto say you know Hitler the one thing hedidn't have for him was the mediapushing his propaganda just like theDemocrats so anyway so when he kickedout Jorge Ramos from one of the pressconferences because Jorge Ramos wasbeing a child and didn't want to waithis turn or had his turn in wanted moretime I said oh my god tomorrow it's overfor him you know the process comingafter him everybody's coming after himbecause you you don't do that to JorgeRamos you know he's like the you knowhe's he's just held in this greatposition in the Latino community and Isaid it's over for trial his campaign isover and the next day he kept going hewent back down and I said that's why Iwant as president he's a man with ballsthat's what we need and someone who'snot going to cower just because you knowthe media saying XYZ so that's when Igot on the Trump train but I'll tell youwhen I finally walked away and it's beenin pieces but this is a memory Iremember is watching the San Jose rallyon television and watching I mean Iclose my eyes and I can still see theimages and there they still upset mebecause this is not the America that Igrew up in but watching them egg a womanwatching them scream it you knowfamilies holding their babies in theirarmsand the worst what was the arrow viewaerial view of a white kid skinny whitekid I'll never forget itrunning around and and being chased likehe was prey no police aroundand all this and bloody people you knowsucker-punchedand all this because they decided tosupport a candidate for president andthe media was telling them that this wasa he was a second coming of of Hitlerand neo-nazi and what all eyes whitesupremacist all absolute lies that'swhen I said whatever is happening here Idon't know if I could support a partythat the next day does not condemn theseviolent acts in fact they blamed it onTrump's rhetoric if you know and theystill do everything is Trunks well youknow they're the Democrats are like thechildren that never ever takeresponsibility for anything to this dayit always well Trump said you can grabthem by the bleed so we're going to youknow it's okay if this happens are andtrucks it no responsibility for theiractions but when the Democratic Partyincluding Hillary did not come out andcondemn that I said never again I cannotsupport a party that is turning thiscountry into you know countries that weleave we leave countries that you knowdon't allow you to dissent from you knowwhatever the mainstream government orparty and power want you to believe youknowcommunism socialism all that stuff wecome here for the American Dream not theMexican nightmare not the Honduran nightwe're not the Salvadorian not any ofthatand these auntie fuzz became synonymouswith the left and and the leftstill to this day we're not call themwhat they are they're monsters they'reviolent hateful mom so that's when Ireally walked away and every day it'sconfirmed to me that I made the rightdecisionbecause I mean Eric Holder recently saidyou know when they go low we kick upHillary we can't be civil until we getback into power then we'll chill youknow Maxine Waters go don't let them eatdon't follow them everywhere basicallycalling for mobs to go after anyonethat's a Republican they've had powdersaid to them you know we've hadRepublicans shot while playing baseballby someone who was in from what I knowsomeone who was a heavy into the MSNBCespecially Rachel Maddow who if you everwatch her it's all conspiracies CNN youknow all the Liberals thought that tellsyou that the end of the world is comingevery day you know in two years laterit's not the end of the worldhe hasn't blown the world up insteadhe's actually done the opposite and theystill want to say that this is gonnahappen when reality is that we'reexperiencing amazing results from anamazing president who is fulfillingpromises so that's that's my main reasonfor walking away you know it started outfor me for selfish reasons for Obamacarebecause I hate it that extra you knowpenalty when I pay taxes and I do babytaxes but then it really became for me aa matter of walking away and stayingaway because this is about saving ourcountry I have gone to Democrat eventand people literally are clapping forredistribution of wealth for socialistideas and it just mind boggles me youknow the reason I I'm staying where I'mput and never going back is becauseinstead of you know supporting me asindividual I'm called names you know ofcourse the sellout I the optimizedsign Spanish for Uncle Tom but all thesehateful vile names I've been attackedtwice myself physically you knowapparently wearing a latina for Trump'sshirt triggers them am I gonna stopwearing my Latinos red truck shirt noyou know I want my children to live inthe America that I grew up in where wemay have disagreements but we don'tattack each other just because of ashirt that we're wearing that supports acandidate or a president or whoever thatwe don't agree with that's fascism youknow and and it's sad to me that insteadof being happy for me when I went to theinauguration and or when I go somewhereand they see me wearing my Trump stuffinstead of you know being happy for methey said mom please be careful pleasebe careful they're more worried about mebecause they know and they see what'sgoing on with the violence targetingTrent supporters and they what my oldesthas asked me to mom can you not wearthem cuz you know we worry about you andI said no you know I know that you worrybut I want you guys to live in thecountry that I grew up in the countrythat my parents came to that promises usfreedom of speech and-and-and we canhave that freedom to express ourselveshow we want without fear of being beatup by moms and now these mobs are beingencouraged and promoted by the Democratsand it's not noon already Lynch calledshe said there may be blood on thestreets when Trump got elected this isnot new you want to talk about dogwhistles that's where we have the dogwhistles so that's my walk away storyyou know it's not terribly exciting butI wanted to make this video becausesometimes it is frustrating watching allthe violence out there but I always tellpeople I go let them keep doing whatthey're doing because there's moderateDemocrats likethey're not gonna be okay with that andare gonna see the good that thispresident is doing and are going to walkaway and realize that they should neverfor now I like to Democrat into anythingthey are so power hungry that they areacting unhinged they are promotinglawlessness when you are okay with acaravan of invaders coming from Centraland South America to just barge into ourcountry as a lawmaker you are promotinglawlessness so no Democrat in my opinionis worthy of my vote now and I hope manypeople feel that wayI don't know what's gonna happen youknow this with the Democrats I just knowthat for now I can never vote Democratagain and I literally I don't fear Ithink it's good that we have a balancein the government but I've never beenmore afraid of the Democrats gettingcontrol than I am nowbecause of what they are spewing andwhat they represent it's pretty amazingI mean if Trump's policies were failingI could I could see getting behind themif they didn't you know advocate for moband in lawlessness but in this caseAmericans in general are doing betterunder the Trump administration andRepublicans so you would think theywould be happy with that you know lowLatino and black unemployment low andemployment for women blacks four hundredpercent increase in business ownershipit's it's like what do they want us tobe you know unemployed homeless anddependent on the government and you knowbut we're gonna mark that Democrat boxno no I'm literally scared of anyDemocrat gettingany power so that's my walkaway storyand remember deplorable lives

my name is Josh Rooker and I recentlymade a post in the walkaway fanpage andkind of wanted to give my story as I hadstated before I was raised in SouthGeorgia I am a southern boy raised bornraised all my life and you know aroundBerrien and Lowndes County you knowwe're right in the middle of thesouthern interstate section where itruns right into North Florida you knowI've lived in West Palm Beach FloridaI've lived up north georgia aroundAthensI've spent a little bit of time inAlabama and I can't say I've goneanywhere else except but we can visitget way to Tennessee but other than thatI would say I've been a South Georgiaresident my entire life with that saidno I am NOT a Russian but as I'venoticed that some of the commentatorshave posted many times in the commentsection when we're coming regarding mypost and just to prove that that'sreally me and that I'm not a bot here'sthe beautiful drawing of our dear leaderPresident Donald J Trump that I drewshine and all I did this with anumber-two pencil on plain paper and youknow that's not my best work to behonest because I'm a pretty decentartist I've also been working on thisbeautiful picture of the dear Mick Foleyfrom the WWE how about that I'm reallyreally good at what I do so I'm not justyou know taking people's work off theinternet and telling a bunch of Lies tothe community no I really do despise theDemocratic Party and everything thatthey have done to my community 10 yearsago we had new subdivisions gone upwhere everyone can live a nicecomfortable reasonable rent homeslooking at it now many of theseneighborhoods have rundown rented to lowrent and they've let a lot of bad peoplemove into these communities a rise incrime rate no jobs even I can barelyfind a job flipping burgers I went tocollege for computer science a computersupport I wanted to be a video gamedeveloper and then found out that Iwould have to move about a thousandmiles away minimal in order to find areasonable income down here I couldeither flip burgergo do my best to try to sell cars suchas I did when I worked about us toToyota Scion there are a very nicedealership they gave me a pretty goodopportunity to make some moneyhowever car sales were in such a slumpdue to Obama that I couldn't hardly moveany inventory we were pushing pushingpushing those Priuses honey they werenot selling our hybrid lines were notselling it was hurting our Toyota brandaltogether because people thought all ofour cars now use these hybrid engines sowe couldn't move even our our Camrys ourcords they just didn't go what went ourtrucks are big trucks our gasolineguzzlers you know the kind of vehiclesthat you know president Trump has triedto push on the market is you knowwhenever he lowered some of the taxesand a lot of the incentives and stufftoward the automobile industry to pushtoward green energy when we really don'tneed to we have all the oil we could useand President Trump is finally making itpossible for us to get some of thatavailable but back to the DemocraticParty let's see when I was in highschool I was a Christian I was aconservative okay I went to church I wasa Baptist at one point I drifted intoPentecostalism and got caught up intosome of their beliefs I even foundmyself by the age of 19 years old as amember of the Church of Jesus Christ oflatter-day saints believing they werethe one true church because I saw somuch apostasy and disagreement andhatred and delusion in the ChristianChurch as far as their ability to getalong many of the groups just want toargue facts fictions and ideas some ofthem not even biblical to the point somany groups just believe whatever theywant you could open his church on anycorner and that's what I mean you didthere's a reason we called the BibleBelt folks I'm not disrespectingChristians because I love Christians butmy views are kind of in a middle groundI don't really have anything concretethat I can say that I really trulybelieve but I do believe in God and Ihope that no one is offended by that youknow I'm still in a point in my lifefrom so trying to learn and figure outwho exactly I am so with that said Iwant everyone to understand thatthroughout high school I really didbelieve in the Lord Jesus Christ whilesimultaneously believing there was alike for gay rights and when you havethat sort of discussion in your head youwhen you do win the religion starts tolose this hold a little bit you start tolean a little bit to the left becauseyou believe they got your best interestat heart and I really did believe thatbut it wasn't Barack Obama who gave usgay marriage it was the Supreme Courtokay what we did get from Barack Obamawas higher taxes what we did get fromhimwas a major curt to our coke our coalsector what we have gotten is a majorboost to Walmart where most of our goodsare come from now because they're theeveryday low prices folks and guess whatthey've pushed out the middleman andmade China the wealthiest nation onearth and with the largest populationand they are really kicking our buttsso um as far as the Democrats concernedthey've never did anything for me theydidn't help with the gay rights and nowthe left has completely lost their mindsand the party has let them take over andI'm sick of feeling like I am a bad guywhen I've never heard anyone I've alwaystried to live by the Word of God and bea you know a good man and even when Ilost my faith in God I've always beengood to people I've never been racistbut I have a story to tell and it wasreally heartbreaking because it happenedlast night I went to hang out with agood friend of mine who I haven't seenin quite some time we loved to chilltogether and have a good time play videogames you know we just we've always justbeen buds but we always seem to you knowhit a chord with each other when itcomes to political issues he's not verywell informed and he gets a lot of hisnews from scrolling Facebook so um hehad his buddy who's his roommate nowwhen he's been staying there for about acouple months and I've haven't been overthere very much but we've becomeacquainted start talking about a lot ofissues but when politics comes up that'swhen things take a turn because I couldnot believe that hell I could you knowgo at in the issues and try to discussPresident Trump in his policies anddiscuss economic nationalism and howAmerica is actually doing tremendouslybetter and actually stands a chance atbeing a world power and the last bastionof freedom on the globe because we havea mintue amendment rights that give usthe right to bear arms totake ourself from government tyranny wehave to write the freedom of speech sothey cannot oppose that and they can'tactually attack us for it we have theright to assemble peacefully we have theright to protest if they destroy thatwe're no better than any other countryin the world and the Democrats are havebeen coming for those rights for atleast a decade if not stealthily longerthe corruption in the DNC ispreposterous anything that theRepublicans have done doesn't even touchthe corruption that the Democrats notonly tried to cover but successfullycovered and have tried to paint theRepublicans as the enemies for decadesbut what I will tell you is thatanything that time I've seen Republicansactually run an area of the countrythings do reasonably well even if theydon't have the

party thanthe one that I thought had my back Iencourage everyone out there who's everbeen a Democrat to really examineHillary's emails to really examine DNCcorruption to see how they threw Bernieunder the bus all you people who thinkthat the people leaving the DemocraticParty are a bunch of Nazis orRepublicans or Russian BOTS or trolls orwhatever you want to say you need to geta clue and realize that real Americanswho are really hurting who arelosing their friends who were havingfights with their families who are justtrying to see this country recovers sothey can go out and have the sameopportunity that their parents andgrandparents had especially theirgrandparents and great-grandparents bestall I want is a better America and Ithink Donald Trump is actually fightingfor us no matter what they throw on themno matter what they try to trip him withno matter how many boogers and snotrolls they throw at him I don't careDonald Trump cares about America even ifhe is getting a little greased on theside walk away
this is my walk away storymy walking away didn't happen all atonce it probably began with the iraq warit was obvious that most americansdidn't want this war yet our governmentwent ahead with it anywayi lost some faith in both the governmentand the press at that timei disliked george w bush and thought hethought that i thought that we needed achangeobama ran on that change hope and changeso i voted for him in both 2008 and2012.well things didn't get any better wewere on the verge of war with syria andwe were on the side of israel pummelinggaza mercilesslythis was when i began to suspect theexistence of a deep stateadministrations change but nothingchangesi kind of disengaged from politics untilwell into the 2015 pre-election campaigni saw how vehemently the press demonizedtrumpand wondered why i'd heard him speak andhe was saying exactly what i hadsecretly believed was wrong with ourcountryhe endorsed policies that i was inagreement with stopping illegalimmigrationbringing manufacturing jobs back to theunited statesgoing out getting us out of unnecessarywars in the middle easti'd already linked the media and theestablishmentand so when the media viciously attractattacked trumpi automatically favored him alsoas i tweeted at the time he was not apoliticianand he was not beholden to any big moneyinterestshe didn't need them and he didn't getrich off of politicsi knew hillary was corrupt i knew abouther role in benghaziso i voted for trump in 2016. it quicklybecame obvious that the pressacademia and the deep state did notaccept trump aspresident they didn't accept thelegitimacy of the 2016 electioni began to see the similarity betweenall the media's positionon every major issue as virtuallyidenticalto the position of the communist partyusai was firmly on the trump train by thistime though i was disappointed in someof his decisionshis saber rattling towards iran i saw asunnecessaryand his too close association withbenjamin netanyahu was concerningbecause i don't want to see any more ofthe us fighting wars for israel or forany other foreign poweri saw how the media democrat leftistcommunistsi now see them all as one used the covenvirusto impose a chokehold on our economywith no end in sight deaths are downhospitalizations are down yet in moststates the restrictions continueespecially in democrat run citiesi can't conceive of any rationalexplanationfor these lockdowns other than to hurtthe economy andthus trump's chances for winning in thein 2020the science doesn't support theseand then there are the riots georgefloyd was a sparkbut the fuel was provided by the leftistdemocrats and mediathey have been fomenting racialanimosity pushing white guilt and blackvictimization way out of proportion towhat it should bethey are the divisive party though theyaccuse the republicans of itin fact most of what they accuse therepublicans ofthey themselves are doing to an extremedegreeas the democratic party moved fartherand farther leftdivide became what i believe isunbridgeableand now we have a choice between keepingthe usa as the country it was foundedas or completely remaking itin the image of the socialists andcommuniststhat scares me i truly believe that ifthe democrats gain powerthis country will cease to exist aswe've known it for the past 250 yearsvote trump
on my phone I don't know how much room Ihave but I have like a major member Khanhi I'm Dara I'm 27 years old and this ismy walk away story I posted my story awhile back on the thing and I made avideo but I don't know if it got lost intranslation or wasn't posted it doesn'treally matter that's not the point ofthis the point is just to kind of get itout as somebody who is one and infp andstuff I've always kind of been led by mypersonal morals and stuff and so it'skind of interesting so I guess I'llstart at the beginninggrowing up I didn't really have I didn'treally think about politicsI was always pro-life because it made nosense to be pro-choice because to meliving things grew when living thingsgrow like that's that's my main argumentlike um so I kind of started gettinginto politics once I turned 18 because Iwas really sad excited to be able tovote I thought it was the greatestopportunity in the world and I washonored to be able to well have thathonorso I've registered to vote when I wasseventeen and a half at a Gay PrideFestival which some people may thinkthat it was legal but I would have been18 before the next election soapparently it counted at least in mystate so one of the things you shouldknow is that living in Washington Statethey require you now and they did when Iregistered so like 10 years ago youregister as a certain party you have toregister as either democrat orrepublican you can't register usindependentI'll give you a party about anythingelse it's one of the other now that'sincredibly invasive but that is just theway that life works I guessso I registered as a Democrat I mean theway that my grandpa explained it when Iasked him because I didn't know was thatRepublicans only want to keep the moneyand they don't want to help anybody andthat's just the way it was they wereselfish and they never did anything goodand people were miserable and etc etc heexplained liberalism as giving thingsaway as wanting to help people asimplementing programs so that people canget on their feet and everything elseand I was like that's cool I mean thatmakes a lot of sense yeah I want to helppeople awesome so I voted Democrat and Iwas happy that Obama won cuz I thoughtRomney was an idiot and to be honest Istill kind of do but I moved in with mymom after a while and she was going tolaw school so she was takingconstitutional law and she was reallyjust listening to what was going on inthe political atmosphere and I wouldtalk to her and she would talk about howa lot of the things that Obama was doingwas unconstitutional well theConstitution is the founding document ofour country why would you go againstthat like that the determinants offreedom that in the Declaration ofIndependence so it was really confusedbut I started watching and you know Istill didn't know how it's gonna go butthen came the opportunity to caucus andI really really wanted to find a carseat that was who I wanted I liked hisidea of the tax inspired by theand I just I thought he was a reallysmart man and he had a lot of reallygood ideas and she was making faith Ireally liked that so my mom and I wentto a local I think it was a junior highschool and we practiced and in order tocaucus you have to register as aRepublican which makes sense becauseit's the Republican caucus so I switchedover at that time just so I could caucusbut I still voted my conscience if therewas a superintendent who happened to bea Democrat or something I and I likedwhat they were advocating for I was votefor them it was when I startedadvocating for Carson and being pro-lifeand everything else that I reallystarted to see the nastiness of the leftand the videos that were Shepherd seeingof supporters getting pepper sprayed andpunched in the face and everything elsejust kind of made me sit back and Ididn't want Donald Trump but I didn'twant Hillary I voted for Carson I didn'teven vote for Trump but you know I stillwanted to as I still wanting to you knowthey're more and everything else and solike I started looking these things upand I'm gonna start alerting people youknow like have you heard about this okayyou know like I didn't know what waswhat the big deal about Benghazi was Ithink you know like I was so politicallydone and so brainwashed that when Ifound these things out it just it brokemy heart and I liked Trump's firstannouncement that he was running Ithought he had a lot of really goodideas and I like to review andeverything else but is don't like Ithought the Trump was had a mouth on himand I didn't like himelse and so when the election happened Ihad a friend who happened to be from NewZealand and she was worried she wasgonna get deported and when I tried toencourage her to say no that's just forpeople who came over here legally youdon't have to worry about it she wentoff and I she she kept attacking me formy views every single post I made toavailable your realm about that here'show it really is and the more peopleattacked me and these were people whowere supposed to be from the tolerantleft these were the people who aresupposed to advocate for you know allthis other stuff but then I saw peoplelate trying to censor speech andeverything else and finally I was like Idon't I don't want to be part of thisand the final straw was when that friendwhen and she's like you know you'reacting really transphobic and racist andyou can't see that you don't see colorbecause that's just creeping people inand you can't do that and you you'rehomophobic and transphobic and you'reyou're a rapist sympathizer because youyou don't support abortion and you'reraces because you don't support abortionwhich looks narrow sense because most ofthe children that are aborted areminority children and you know finallyit just got to the point where she toldme you can't think for yourself andyou're being really stupid and I waslike I am thinking for myself andbasically there was this whole onemessage and finally I just said I walkedaway from the Democratic Party and Iwould never go back I just I couldn'tand so it was just the straw that brokethe camel's back I started seeing morenastiness and I hate unkindness which iswhyI kind of hate politics um and alsobecause like most of the time I can findmiddle ground on stuff like I am I hateBig Pharma I think that we need to getthe government we need to regulate thathonestly um because I spend $200 withoutinsurance on stomach medication that isneeded I'm all for the medic thelegalization of marijuana because Ithink that with how advanced the growinghas gotten and how they can literallydedicate different strains can help alot of people a lot of people withcancer and then our education system hasseverely failed people it's more of an adoctor station though than Pink Floydcomes to mind let's see uh you know likeall of these things so yes I I am nowofficially a Republican I will not youknow well go back unless the DemocraticParty changes its views but the way thatI see it is that less government equalsmore freedom more government equals morecontrol and I was raised to believe thatthe United States government is supposedto be one of the people for the peopleby the people which means that thegovernment is supposed to get its noseout of our business and so that's why Iwalked awayI don't want government control[Music]

changed for me you know when youstart having children your worldviewchanges you start to see the future youstart to see things differently and andI saw that plus my um my politics areinformed by my Christian faith and whenthe Democrats didn't line up with myfaith I had to get out I had to get outI mean you know black folkstraditionally traditionally voteDemocratic because they just do theirparents are their neighborhoods are andthey're Democrats by default then youknow so so was Iuntil I started looking and thinking andseeing and so that was my walk awaystoryfast forward to Barack

hi my name is Maggie and this is my walkaway story I grew up in PittsburghPennsylvania which is a liberaldemocratic town I did not ever questionbeing a liberal Democrat because numberone I was born into it and it wasnatural number two I believe that to beconservative or republican was to begreedy narrow-minded bigoted and againstthe environment I was firmly entrenchedin my liberal mindset and I saw myselfas morally superior I always identifiedwith the underdogI had a sixth sense for findingpersecution I learned from the liberalmindset to see people in authority aspersecutors every CEO every policeofficer was probably a despot when I gota job at a liberal nonprofit in TucsonArizona also a very liberal town Istarted to question being a liberal thiswas a direct result of working withliberals and seeing the liberal beliefsplayed out in real time I worked in adepartment of people that saw themselvesas the persecuted minority of theorganization also a liberal mind set tofeel like they're being persecuted whatmaybe you are but you're probably not weoften talk bad about everyone else inthe organization because they didn't doas much important work as we did werelentlessly made fun of the CEO becausehe was obviously evil and greedy when Iinteracted with him one on one he wasactually very kind and I really had nospecific reason not to support him but Ialso didn't want anyone to know this soI kept quiet because I had to stay inthe group my department focused onteaching people how to grow their ownfoodI specifically worked on an organic farmand we received a few really largegrants while I worked there whichallowed us to spend a lot of moneyI saw my co-workers spend a lot of moneyfor our programs without much oversightat all it seems strange to me that wecould just buy whatever we wantedbecause I'd tend to be very frugal but Iwanted to fit in so again didn't saymuch but then we bought atop-of-the-line tractor and we neverused it that's when bells and whistlesstarted going off in my head the purplethe person who was supposed to use thatnever did it almost even like he wasscared because we were all very youngand inexperienced and here we have areally expensive tractor and we reallydon't know how to use it whatever thereason the tractor just collected dustthis wasteful spending is indicative ofliberalism liberals like to spend otherpeople's money because they like hightaxes and what when they do they do itwastefully it's very easy to buy anexpensive tractor because the governmentgave us a huge grant and we actuallyhave to spend the money within a certaintime frame or we would lose some moneyso there was an incentive to waste moneya for-profit business has to be carefulabout its spending so that its spendingdoesn't exceed its profits but when wehave other people's money we can spendit however we want it's wasteful and isliberal some other things that help towake me up from this mentality was thismentality of heating the person incharge that we all had this is liberalto the core we disliked Authority somuch that we decided no one should be incharge now there was a person who hadthe title farm manager but everyonesilently agreed that she should not havemuch power she even agreed to this butwhat ended up happening is that she andI did all the work I was her assistantso she and I did all the work andeveryone else just did their own thingsometimes these people didn't even cometo work why would they when there was noconsequence for their action when thingsgot hard they just said they were busywith other projects I got so fed up andI walked away from being a liberal andthis crazy Lord of the Flies mindsetand again another liberal indicative ofliberalism it's Lord of the Flies it'schaos the things that they believe don'tmake sense when played out in therailroad it doesn't make sense to notrespect the person in charge becausethen how are things going to runproperly now I wouldn't just become anangry person but while this washappening and that's someone who wasreasonable and conservative he angeredme but he made me think long story shortwe got married and when I got pregnant Iwas able to leave that job and I havenever looked back I loved the work I didbut the people I worked with wereillogical unreasonable and liberalexcept one person who I still keep incontact with so those are the reasonsthat I left the liberal mindset I'm notvery political so the Democratic part itdoesn't hold as much weight with me butthe liberal part they were all crazyillogical agnostic that's a whole notherstorybut branding I want to thank you forgiving us the platform to speak thesestories and god bless you[Music]

this is a vice article I'm reading rightnow it says the activists left doesn'tgive a [ __ ] about your calls forcivility get ready for a summer of arage this is where the party is goingand this is why I chose to walk Oh peace
so now everyone I'm Therese and I tookme a while to become brave enough toactually make a video um when I saw abrand's video I was instantly hooked tohis message because I just felt like ohgosh she's just saying what's in me whatI wanna wanted to say and I I don't havethe right words to sayto say it and I'm not brave enough tosay to my liberal friends and I grew upin Switzerland I moved here in 2008 andmarried over four men from the UnitedStates and when we first got together weboth were liberals I was a very liberalfree-spirited hippie person my youth andback home in Switzerland during before Icame here it was it was kind of likethat all my friends were like ah thepeople in the United States they'recrazy and Bush and uh I didn't know muchabout it and I just kind of like yeahbut yeah he's crazy and but to be honestI I listen to the news but I didn'treally get the problems I didn't reallyget it and I was just following thecrowd and I believed I'm I'm liberal andthey stood for my values and that's justhow I believe everything is I came hereand the election wasn't Obama oh yeahit's so exciting and it was like totallysupporting him and my husband's familyis mainly conservative and I debatedthrough stem I thought I knew things umand so when he got elected I was superexcited I had happy tears and everythingand so and then things went on andand it kind of something changed in myhusband he he just seems to become moremore conservative and it even kind oflike was almost a struggle in ourrelationship in the beginning and hewould he would tell me stuff which Ihave believed but but well now theLiberals that's that's the liberal sideisn't itand he's like no the Conservatives saythat's these are their values and so andI got more and more confused and thenthe whole Syria thing happened and inEurope this Germany and miracle andeverything and I was I started followingthe news in Europe also more and I justwas like oh my I don't like that I don'tlike what I'm seeing I don't think it'sgood and I'm I I saw in the news like ohno it's not a big deal and yeah we haveroom for everyone in Germany but I heardmy friends talking in Europe and theythere we were different no it's not goodthe crimes has gone up and a lot ofhappened and so so this kind of likechanged things for me too and I got moreand more interested in politics here Istarted reading more and I started andlistening more to news and I we startedfollowing fox news toobut because I was not ready at all tobecome conservative I always looked atboth sides and um but it wasn't helpfulat all because I got more and moreconfused that's like I don't get it whois who's telling the truth well what isright what's wrong I don't get it theyand at some point I was like okay youknow what I'm out of hereI just focus on my kids and my familyand my neighborhood that's where I feelcomfortable that's well there you knowwhat's going on and during the electionfrom term I was I kind of thought chopsa joke I mean I didn't think you knowlike I reallydidn't think he could ever be elected Ididn't have a problem with him I thoughtyou know he's actually I actually likethe things he said but I just thoughtthe way he's talking to people the wayhe's talking about our people I justthought well it's not very presidentialand so I thought that's just kind ofjoke will go away and I I personallykind of liked Rubio and ben Carsonwhenever I listen to them I was likeyeah that's yeah I like I like that andI never really liked Hillary I don'tknow what I just there was just too muchcrap going on about her and I I justdidn't trust her her whole personality Idon't know it's just there's somethingabout that lady I could not get my headaround and I like Bill Clinton a lot umbut anyway so I I was like oh I'm glad Idon't have to vote because I have only agreen card so I can't vote unfortunatelybut at that point I was like well okayam i I don't have to do anything I justwatch those crazy Americans and so andthen Trump got elected and I I had tolaugh and I said wait this is so sillyoh wait how is that even possible but Ithought it was pretty cool it's like ohI have to say yeah before Trump hadelected because I wanted to know moreabout him I started reading books abouthim and I cannot add what he's actuallynot that bad I mean it wouldn't be a badidea to have such a successfulbusinessperson we're on a country like alike a business and I kinda thought itwouldn't be that bad and could beinteresting and I really thought of himeven though he's my good jerk sometimesbut I thought he I really liked his wayof big thinking like there's greatthings are possible and and this is kindof like how Ilived my life - I feel like you have tothink bigger and that you can makechanges and if you believe in it and sowhen he got elected I was like yeah youknow what this is this gonna beinteresting and I think he couldactually really make a change so Iposted on Facebook I said even thoughneither of them would be my ideal choiceI I stand behind Trump I support him andI wish him the best of luck in hispresidential time I had oh my that wasnot good I I've worked at a place forsix years and I lost my job because ofthat comment and like the my boss hestarted kind of like debating a littlebit about it and and she really feltpersonally offended by him and and Imean I kind of tried to you know I can Iwas sorry but I also was like but youknow I believe that he actually can dogood and this is my view anyway I lostmy job because of that and we nevertalked any more ever scenes and it wasokay it was kind of tough it was I was ananny know I knew that family for solong I knew they were liberal and theyknew my political views too and it wasjust kind of like oh okay from thatpoint I was like okay I have to becareful I'm I stopped posting things onFacebook I also noticed that some someof my very liberal friends that theyeither unfriended me or they unfollowedme so but I I kept following them and Ijust post those little posts which I itwas like oh but I I can't stand behindthat this is weird it makes me upset andit's and it just got more and more and Ifeel like my facebook feed is like fullof this lies andyeah it just is discussed meet you andand living in Oregon in Portland Oregonwhich is very liberal Ithere's not many conservative friendshere I have and the ones I have I canreally only talk about politics whenwe're when there's nobody else around Inotice that whenever there's a group ofpeople it's only only liberal views arediscussed and every conservative personis just kind of like quiet about itit gets heated the moment somebody ishe's mentioning something positive aboutTrump and so people just stay quietconservatives just stay quiet and andanother thing is also like I got to thepoint where I'm like I talk to myhusband's like what's happening I don'tget it I mean I thought I'm a liberalbut now I'm seeing here all those crazyliberals on the side of the roadprotesting and putting those eight signsup and and stand for something I don'tget i I don't stand for thatand and so I was we talked a lot aboutit and kind of like I started realizingthat well that I mad that the Liberalsare actually not standing behind myvalues and that it's it it's almost likeit totally switched um that yeah I meanyou know you guys know what I'm talkingaboutyouso now everyone I'm Therese and I tookme a while to become brave enough toactually make a video um when I saw abrand's video I was instantly hooked tohis message because I just felt like ohgosh she's just saying what's in me whatI wanna wanted to say

hereand the election wasn't Obama oh yeahit's so exciting and it was like totallysupporting him and my husband's familyis mainly conservative and I debatedthrough stem I thought I knew things umand so when he got elected I was superexcited I had happy tears and everythingand so and then things went on andand it kind of something changed in myhusband he he just seems to become moremore conservative and it even kind oflike was almost a struggle in ourrelationship in the beginning and hewould he would tell me stuff which Ihave believed but but well now theLiberals that's that's the liberal sideisn't itand he's like no the Conservatives saythat's these are their values and so andI got more and more confused and thenthe whole Syria thing happened and inEurope this Germany and miracle andeverything and I was I started followingthe news in Europe also more and I justwas like oh my I don't like that I don'tlike what I'm seeing I don't think it'sgood and I'm I I saw in the news like ohno it's not a big deal and yeah we haveroom for everyone in Germany but I heardmy friends talking in Europe and theythere we were different no it's not goodthe crimes has gone up and a lot ofhappened and so so this kind of likechanged things for me too and I got moreand more interested in politics here Istarted reading more and I started andlistening more to news and I we startedfollowing fox news toobut because I was not ready at all tobecome conservative I always looked atboth sides and um but it wasn't helpfulat all because I got more and moreconfused that's like I don't get it whois who's telling the truth well what isright what's wrong I don't get it theyand at some point I was like okay youknow what I'm out of hereI just focus on my kids and my familyand my neighborhood that's where I feelcomfortable that's well there you knowwhat's going on and during the electionfrom term I was I kind of thought chopsa joke I mean I didn't think you knowlike I reallydidn't think he could ever be elected Ididn't have a problem with him I thoughtyou know he's actually I actually likethe things he said but I just thoughtthe way he's talking to people the wayhe's talking about our people I justthought well it's not very presidentialand so I thought that's just kind ofjoke will go away and I I personallykind of liked Rubio and ben Carsonwhenever I listen to them I was likeyeah that's yeah I like I like that andI never really liked Hillary I don'tknow what I just there was just too muchcrap going on about her and I I justdidn't trust her her whole personality Idon't know it's just there's somethingabout that lady I could not get my headaround and I like Bill Clinton a lot umbut anyway so I I was like oh I'm glad Idon't have to vote because I have only agreen card so I can't vote unfortunatelybut at that point I was like well okayam i I don't have to do anything I justwatch those crazy Americans and so andthen Trump got elected and I I had tolaugh and I said wait this is so sillyoh wait how is that even possible but Ithought it was pretty cool it's like ohI have to say yeah before Trump hadelected because I wanted to know moreabout him I started reading books abouthim and I cannot add what he's actuallynot that bad I mean it wouldn't be a badidea to have such a successfulbusinessperson we're on a country like alike a business and I kinda thought itwouldn't be that bad and could beinteresting and I really thought of himeven though he's my good jerk sometimesbut I thought he I really liked his wayof big thinking like there's greatthings are possible and and this is kindof like how Ilived my life - I feel like you have tothink bigger and that you can makechanges and if you believe in it and sowhen he got elected I was like yeah youknow what this is this gonna beinteresting and I think he couldactually really make a change so Iposted on Facebook I said even thoughneither of them would be my ideal choiceI I stand behind Trump I support him andI wish him the best of luck in hispresidential time I had oh my that wasnot good I I've worked at a place forsix years and I lost my job because ofthat comment and like the my boss hestarted kind of like debating a littlebit about it and and she really feltpersonally offended by him and and Imean I kind of tried to you know I can Iwas sorry but I also was like but youknow I believe that he actually can dogood and this is my view anyway I lostmy job because of that and we nevertalked any more ever scenes and it wasokay it was kind of tough it was I was ananny know I knew that family for solong I knew they were liberal and theyknew my political views too and it wasjust kind of like oh okay from thatpoint I was like okay I have to becareful I'm I stopped posting things onFacebook I also noticed that some someof my very liberal friends that theyeither unfriended me or they unfollowedme so but I I kept following them and Ijust post those little posts which I itwas like oh but I I can't stand behindthat this is weird it makes me upset andit's and it just got more and more and Ifeel like my facebook feed is like fullof this lies andyeah it just is discussed meet you andand living in Oregon in Portland Oregonwhich is very liberal Ithere's not many conservative friendshere I have and the ones I have I canreally only talk about politics whenwe're when there's nobody else around Inotice that whenever there's a group ofpeople it's only only liberal views arediscussed and every conservative personis just kind of like quiet about itit gets heated the moment somebody ishe's mentioning something positive aboutTrump and so people just stay quietconservatives just stay quiet and andanother thing is also like I got to thepoint where I'm like I talk to myhusband's like what's happening I don'tget it I mean I thought I'm a liberalbut now I'm seeing here all those crazyliberals on the side of the roadprotesting and putting those eight signsup and and stand for something I don'tget i I don't stand for thatand and so I was we talked a lot aboutit and kind of like I started realizingthat well that I mad that the Liberalsare actually not standing behind myvalues and that it's it it's almost likeit totally switched um that yeah I meanyou know you guys know what I'm talkingaboutyou
hello to my friends at the walk awaycampaign I'm very glad to have foundthis group which for me has been a greatsource of healing and a comfort inknowing that I'm not alone when for along time I felt like I was we all knowthe typical reasons for walking awaywhether it was being told that you wereresponsible personally for the deaths ofinnocent children because you supportthe Second Amendment or being called aracist because you don't want openborders and anarchy we've all been thereand we've all been bullied and that'swhy we've walked away I wasn't sure whatI wanted to talk about in this videountil today and now that everyone istalking about the crisis at the borderwe really need to talk about rape mywalk away moment began when I was rapedin a liberal safe space it was a partyfull of drugs and alcohol and I wastaken advantage of when I was passed outin an addict my so-called friends allliberals told me that it wasn't my faultand of course it wasn't but theyproceeded to try and tighten our socialsocial circle as if that was going tokeep predators out from parties whereeveryone is drunk and on drugs Irealized that things don't work that wayand that what happened to me was not myfault but I learned that I had toprotect myself because if I hadn't beenpassed out drunk at a party never whathappened you can't tell people not torape and expect rape to stop and youcan't teach consent at college campusesand expect that people are never goingto do evil things that was the darklesson that I learned and that was a bigpart of what caused me to walk away whenI was still hurting over what happenedto me six months later those friendstold me they were too busy and could nothold my hand forever over what happenedmy version of asking for their supportwas maybe an occasional sad moment or atext message they were there to comfortme when they could play the herobut when too much time had passed and Iwas still hurting they were no longerinterested in my pain to me this is agreater party in the Democratic Partythey are there without Rage forsuffering for people who are sufferingbut they don't take practical actionwith realistic solutions to help thosepeople this is hard for me to talk aboutall right currently we have a debateover our nation's borders much of whichis media propaganda and attempt tooverthrow President Trump the left wouldhave people think that Trump supportershate brown people and that's why we wantsecure borders but maybe it's that welove them and want better for themgoing by the logic of the left theywould have us continue to let peoplemake the dangerous journey across theborder and just run to ash sanctuarycity or state one of the countlessproblems with that is that people aredying of heat stroke and exhaustion anddehydration at our borders

I can't stand by a systemthat brutally traumatizes thousands ofwomen and children every year we needreform at our borders and not anarchy Ihave also seen some people people on theright saying that women shouldn't crossif they don't want to beand I would like to speak out againstthat as well just because we makechoices that have consequences doesn'tmean that it was our fault and the ratehas been

thank you forjoining me on my personal journey towalk away this video wasn't easy to makebut I gave it what I had and sharing mystory well hopefully highlight onespecific problem that isn't being talkedabout enough Trump did mention it and ofcourse now the same people that weremaybe talking about women being raped atthe border years ago are now saying thatit's an overblown myth and it's notreally happeningthere have been border patrol agentsthat give reports of 12 year old girlsplanning carrying plan B emergencycontraceptive because they knew theirparents and it with them knowing thatthey would probably be raped and theydidn't want them to become pregnant so Idon't see how you can call somethingoverblown when it's going to be withthat woman for the rest of their lifethey're gonna have to heal that and evenwhen the heal itstill going to be there so I think it'skind of sad that the left will just noteven care they'll just say that it'swe're just making it up when it's

hey guys for those of you who don't knowme my name is Justin Garrett Brannon andI am a proud conservative OrthodoxChristian but I've not always been thatway in the 2016 election I was a BernieSanders supporterI supported Bernie Sanders because Iknew how corrupt Hillary Clinton wasBernie Sanders hit her very hard becauseof her meetings with billionaire donorsher meetings with Wall Street executivesgiant corporations where she was paidhundreds of thousands of dollars andBernie was right he said hey man thatmust have been a powerful speech youknow I would love to hear a speech worth$100,000 or more and I remember how hardhe hit her and then when he supportedher it felt like a betrayal I felt likea betrayal of the American people it waswhat you would see and wrestling isturning heel right he joined the badguys supporting her he knew she was badhe knew he knew she was corrupt he spokeagainst her corruption and then decidedto support her anyways now I had watchedI had watched how Hillary Clinton hadmade back deals with CNN she made dealswith the DNC essentially what wasamazing was she actually made it so thatthe current chairman of the DemocraticNational Committeeshe chose as her vice president and thehead of hercampaign she turned into the head of theDNC so everybody got a promotion if theysupport Hillary Clinton it was a farceit was terrible the way the way that thesuper delegate system worked in theDemocratic Party was absurd and it justit was just terribleit was it was an override of the votersBernie Sanders was packing entirestadiums and Donald Trump was as wellbut Hillary couldn't fill a school andit was amazing to see Bernie Sandersturn heel on the American people andsupport Hillary now I was a huge criticof Donald Trump I consider myself aconsider a conservative Democrat Iconsidered myself a Pro pro-lifedemocrat I've always kind of occupiedthat middle place because I wanted toaffirm social policies but I also youknow had a very strong stance againstabortion and one of the things I hitDonald Trump on was the fact that heused to be pro-choice and right beforehe ran for president he suddenly becamepro-life and I thought that wassuspicious I thought that hisbankruptcies were suspicious I thoughtthat he wasn't a man of characterbecause of how many divorces he's hadand there are a lot of things that youcan say about the president that makesyou that he's not he's not a very greatcandidate I'll be honest I I didn'tthink he was a great candidate then Istill really don't think that he's awonderful person but what I will say isthis what has really driven me far awayfrom the Democratic Party has been theviolence that has been encouraged andthe violence that has beendemonstrated by the Democrats betweenblack lives matter protests that havedevolved into riots multiple multipletimes and auntie feh and the way thatthey have destroyed property the waythat they have literally handed outweapons to protesters shanks and andknives and things like that it wasabsolutely terrifying seeing thesepeople absolutely terrifying seeing whatthese people have done and the fact thatyou have politicians encouraging peopleto act this way when I saw that GovernorPaul Rand was or was a random poll Ican't member he got beat up by hisneighbor he was assaulted and and hisribs were broken when I saw that aDemocrat had taken to a Republicanballgame and shot up the place and shotthem this kind of thing doesn't happenthis kind of political violence does nothappen on the conservative right and themore that I saw this the more turned offI was now Donald Trump has manycharacter flaws I do not believe thatthe man is a Christian but I will saythat I am pleasantly surprised by whathe has done in office when he pulled outof the trans-pacific partnership when hepulled out of the Iran dealthose were big moments big momentsmoving the capital to Israel to thecapital to Jerusalem was something thatthan an American policy for severalgenerations and every president has saidthat they would do it nobody did exceptfor him now as an Orthodox Christian Ihave reservations about that decisionbut he made he actually made good on hispromise he's out trying to build wallshe cut taxes and and my family see I waswhen I was a Bernie supporter previouslythat I had been on welfare I was onwelfare basically because I I had I hada period of of joblessness I don'treally joblessness but I wasn't beingvery effective in the business that Iwas involved in and I I kind of reliedon some social programs and I think thatit was my reliance on social programsthat made me feel like I couldn't Icouldn't possibly be a Republican butright but it's but it's false to suggestthat Republicans don't believe thathardworking Americans should not be ableto get assistance from a system thatthey paid into right it's it's it's fallso those programs need to be I've takenaway I think that one of the things thatreally turned me off was when the taxcuts came and they were called crumbsand how people said that it didn'taffect normal everyday Americans and Ithink that's absurdmy my check my paycheck has grownsignificantly probably a couple hundreddollars a month from the tax cuts inaddition that my company AT&T gave us athousand dollar bonus also AT&T isopening up a thousand more retail storesso this accusation that that lower taxesdid not lead to job growth is absurdunder the Trump administration I wasable to save up enough moneypay off bad debt and to buy a house I amnow sitting in a house that are I'mstanding in a house that I couldn't thatI couldn't have before and that's a bigdeal two hundred dollars a month is onlynot a big deal - rich Liberal Democratsyou know rich Liberal Democrats who havealready made their money and they'realready you know in their 30s or 40s ortheir kids who are who they've raisedand and and you know they're probablystill in college and their parents arepaying for a bunch of their stuff andthey just don't like it's just theydon't have a grasp on reality they don'tknow what it's like to be making fortyfifty thousand dollars a year and havingtwo kids they don't know what an extra$200 a month can mean in a family'sgrocery budget and that's just huge forme that was enormous and I just I don'tknow the more that I see Donald Trump inaction the more that I see that he is infact an effective president do I thinkis a good person no I don't think theDonald Trump is a good person but do Ithink he's a good president I do I do Ido think that Donald Trump is a verygood ineffective president when liberalswere concerned about him starting a warbetween us and North Korea he's actuallyseeming to cause some sort of peace inNorth Korea and in the deep pnk and it'sjust I don't know what it is maybe youknow maybe Kim Jang Geun needed to havesomebody who is man enough to make bigwords and flex the American muscle andtell them hey you know we're not gonnatolerate you launching missiles over ourallies it's not going to happenin the meantime you know our previouspresident did nothing aboutthe fact that these guys attacked anAmerican company because of a movie thatmade fun of her leader the interview andI just I think that Donald Trump showingstrength American strength to the UnitedNations and telling them look if youwant our funding you can't just youcan't just do you can't just keep votingagainst usright if you want us to continue to fundliterally a quarter of your budgetyou can't keep painting us as evil inand backing you know these thesecountries that have known links links toterrorism there's just there's just alot that's happening the Cavanaughyou know the Cavanaugh hearings you seea good guywho's never had a problem in his lifeyou know a date the day that his name ismentioned there are people holdingbasically calling him evil on the huntthey don't even know who the guys whothe guy is they're calling him evil onthe very day that his name is mentionedthere was a tweet that went out fromfeminists who basically they just theysaid you know we oppose xx meaningwhoever whoever it is that Donald Trumpnominates we oppose them and then hislife was destroyed right and then peopleget mad that he that he had the nerve tosay hey look I'm being attacked bypolitical like by political people forpolitical reasons and they think thathim pointing that out means that hecan't be a good judge when he has thathad a stellar record for the entirety ofhis career when he's called a serialgang rapists and doesn't like the ideathat his name is being dragged throughthe mud when he hasn't done anything todeserve itthat kind of that kind of nonsense thatis toleratedand propagated by the media and and yeahI just I when I see how CNN can colludedwith the Hillary Clinton campaign when Isee how they're spinning stories aboutthe president and about his nominee forfor the Supreme Court I see these thingsand yeah I I agree it's fake news it'sthat's what it is it's fake news andAmericans need to depend more onindependent media because these giantnews companies they can't be heldaccountable they won't be heldaccountable in their political machinesI don't think that it's possible you canyou could you know that's that's that'strue for Fox News as well they're allpolitical machines and they're notgiving people the whole storyneither side and I think this is why Ihad to walk away from the DemocraticParty there's just so much violence andcorruption and deception and lying I hadto walk away and they said hey wethere's no room and I on our party for apro-life democrat they said that the netat the Democratic National Committee ourconference they said that that there wasno room for people who did not havesupport pro-choice so they told me thatthey don't want my vote and I'll nevergive it to him againhashtag walk awayhey guys for those of you who don't knowme my name is Justin Garrett Brannon andI am a proud

away
hi I'm a lifelong Democrat and I'mwalking away from the Democratic Party Ihave a lot of reasons but one that I canthink of that's important is that Ithink the Democrats have stopped tellingthe truth I went to Carolina friendsschool and it's a Quaker school and westarted celebrating Martin Luther KingJr's birthday before it was a nationalholiday so I was raised in it not just aliberal environment but an extremelysocial justice oriented anti racismenvironment and I always believed thatyou know voter ID laws were racist andthat this was racist and that was racistand there's no greater fear that I hadthan being a racist I think being aracist is the worst thing that you cancall someone I happen to also be Jewishso maybe there's a little extra fearthere of you know ostracizing groups ofpeople and one thing I realized is withthe voter ID thing I mean don't you needa driver's license to buy alcoholdon't you need a driver's license todrive and is the the notion that thereare so many you owe and to get a bankaccount so is the idea that there arethese groups of people that can't getbank accounts can't buy alcohol andcan't drive and that they belongspecifically to a racial group and thattherefore requiring IDs is racist and II don't know I mean I think that thatshould be dealt with if there really arelarge groups of people who are in thatsituation but I don't think that itshould be seen as racial profiling and Icertainly do not think that it shouldmean that you don't need an ID to voteso that's just I mean I have that beliefand believe me if I told that belief tothe people that I know I would be calleda racist and to me it's actually racistto see it the other way to assigncertain color groups to certaininabilities it's likedisabling a group because of their colorand not look like just treatingeverybody the same and hoping the bestfor everyone helping everyone I don'tknow maybe it's hard for people tounderstand that but that was justsomething that I had a very difficulttime rationalizing trying to figure outwhy is it that I believe this but thatI'm also Democrat and this idea of beingrational you have to have facts to berational but the Democrats have not beenpresenting the truththey did not present the truth when itcame to corruption they didn't presentthe truth when it came to people beingabove the law they wanted us to justaccept corruption as part of the gameand you know they actually have not beenhonest and they've used the media to dothat and I could go on and on about thattoo but I think that that has created asickness that not being honest aboutpolicies not being honest about howthings work and try to create a certainnarrative has made people uncomfortableit's made Democrats uncomfortable moredesperate because they have some kind ofcognitive dissonance where they'retrying to rationalize these twoconflicting views and trying to makeeverything fit into this narrative andthe reason it doesn't is because they'reaspects of it that just aren't honest sothere's another thing um I definitelydidn't think that immigration was anissue for me I'd never have and I youknow didn't say I mean you know to me itwas obvious I know it's really hard toget a green card you got to wait a longtime but it never occurred to me that Iwould have a position on immigration mychildren are in public school where welive and the population has exploded inour area but the tax base has not risenalong with it so what's happened is wehave all these other people who've movedin and I can't prove for a fact thatthey're not paying taxes but I know thatour school has gotten poorer and poorerand that we're overwhelmed you know thekids are learning in trailers becausethere's not enough space and there allkinds of language barriers is toohuge stress on the system so myphilosophy is that if you're gonna haveall these new people coming into thearea there has to be a certain amount offunding to help to get everybody welleducated and have that this system beable to support that but I don't thinkthat our immigration system takes intoaccount how we're going to supportpeople who come into areas who aren't asfinancially well-off and able to paytaxes and so I don't think that it'sit's logical to just expect everythingto work out if you're not going it'slike I don't know sending somebody on atrip and saying that they don't know howmuch money they're gonna have but theyhave to somehow survive but then theycan't budget it's not budgeting and it'snot logical or sensible it just createstension and problems and stress andstress on the teachers stress on thekids so but what does that all reallymean when it comes to the DemocraticParty it means that if I were to saythat I would be a racist it means thatif I believe that people should comeacross the border legally that there'ssomething wrong with me that I'm tryingto keep people out and so I thoughtabout it and I think this is the anotherthing I voted for Obama twice and I didbecause I wanted Obamacare to work I Iwant to socialized medicine I stillbelieve that socialized medicine couldwork but I have a different view of itnow because I realized that if you don'tclose the borders you can't havesuccessful socialized education whichI've learned and you can't havesuccessful socialized medicine in orderto have some kind of socializedassistance of work there has to be somekind of way to calculate how many peopleare going to be receiving funds eachyear and what the income is going to befrom taxes there has to be a way to wellI don't want to say control theimmigration but I do think thatimmigration needs to be controlled ifyou're going to pursue social programsand so actually during this lastelection I was looking at Bernie Sandersand I realized hey if Bernie Sanderscame out and said that he'sfor socialized medicine and free collegebut that we have to close the bordersthen I would vote for him but that's aproblem you can'tin my opinion mathematically have openborders and have any of the socialprograms of Democrats proposed and to methat's very dishonest and I don't likedishonesty and I think that that hasmade a lot of sickness for a lot ofpeople I think another thing that I justwant to mention is the whole fear ofcoming out I actually wanted to come outa long time ago and the truth is is thatI didn't because I had already had someharassment I posted a Jill Stein articleon my Facebook page and the people frommy friend the school that I went to thishippie school peace love and happinessactually got on my page on the page thateverybody else could see and post it tome saying that I was a racist because Iwasn't supporting Hillary Clintonbecause I posted a anti-war piece ofliterature about Jill Stein well why Imean that's that's really harassmentit's really bad and you know maybe thesewere trolls okay maybe I you know maybeit was a trick but I can tell you rightnow that the whole idea of beinganti-war is something that's veryimportant to me and it's just sohypocritical I know that they weren'ttrolls actually because they went to myschool and I exact I know exactly whothey were so who would hire them to dothat but I'm just saying there's so muchharassment right now it's hard tobelieve that it's all real it's justthere's so much of it and the censorshipI mean that's another reason why Ididn't vote for Hillary Clinton wasbecause she had it so that Pepe the Frogwas a hate symbol and that hate symbolmeant that my kid who knew about Pepe heknew about the meme couldn't wear at-shirt with the Pepe meme on it toschool because people thought that itwas a Nazi symbol and I mean when Istarted explaining to my children aboutall these things they can't say atschool because people will think thatthey're racist they started to say to mewhat are you saying that we have to hideour views because people willmisunderstand us and now this year witheverything that's happenedit's starting to remind me of you knowmy ancestors who had to hide the factthat they were Jewish or when my mothermary did you how she got into so muchtrouble and that my father who grew upJewish his mother tried to hide the factthat she was Jewish and that people knewthem they wouldn't let anybody know thatthey were Jewish and this whole idea ofhiding your identity is just I mean Idon't believe in identity politics Idon't like them but I certainly don'tthink that anybody should have to hidewho they are or what they believe unlessit's harmful unless what your view is isyou know I don't know I want to go killpeople or something like that that's badso I mean I could go on for a long timebut I just wanted to say how grateful Iam for this movement and I hope thatother people are gonna be making morevideos and I feel like now if somethinghappens if I get harassed for makingthis video I do feel a lot stronger andI really appreciate the people who havetaken the risk for all of us thank youhi I'm a lifelong Democrat and I'mwalking away from the Democratic Party Ihave a lot of reasons but one that I canthink of that's important is that Ithink the Democrats have stopped tellingthe truth I went to Carolina

aboutpolicies not being honest about howthings work and try to create a certainnarrative has made people uncomfortableit's made Democrats uncomfortable moredesperate because they have some kind ofcognitive dissonance where they'retrying to rationalize these twoconflicting views and trying to makeeverything fit into this narrative andthe reason it doesn't is because they'reaspects of it that just aren't honest sothere's another thing um I definitelydidn't think that immigration was anissue for me I'd never have and I youknow didn't say I mean you know to me itwas obvious I know it's really hard toget a green card you got to wait a longtime but it never occurred to me that Iwould have a position on immigration mychildren are in public school where welive and the population has exploded inour area but the tax base has not risenalong with it so what's happened is wehave all these other people who've movedin and I can't prove for a fact thatthey're not paying taxes but I know thatour school has gotten poorer and poorerand that we're overwhelmed you know thekids are learning in trailers becausethere's not enough space and there allkinds of language barriers is toohuge stress on the system so myphilosophy is that if you're gonna haveall these new people coming into thearea there has to be a certain amount offunding to help to get everybody welleducated and have that this system beable to support that but I don't thinkthat our immigration system takes intoaccount how we're going to supportpeople who come into areas who aren't asfinancially well-off and able to paytaxes and so I don't think that it'sit's logical to just expect everythingto work out if you're not going it'slike I don't know sending somebody on atrip and saying that they don't know howmuch money they're gonna have but theyhave to somehow survive but then theycan't budget it's not budgeting and it'snot logical or sensible it just createstension and problems and stress andstress on the teachers stress on thekids so but what does that all reallymean when it comes to the DemocraticParty it means that if I were to saythat I would be a racist it means thatif I believe that people should comeacross the border legally that there'ssomething wrong with me that I'm tryingto keep people out and so I thoughtabout it and I think this is the anotherthing I voted for Obama twice and I didbecause I wanted Obamacare to work I Iwant to socialized medicine I stillbelieve that socialized medicine couldwork but I have a different view of itnow because I realized that if you don'tclose the borders you can't havesuccessful socialized education whichI've learned and you can't havesuccessful socialized medicine in orderto have some kind of socializedassistance of work there has to be somekind of way to calculate how many peopleare going to be receiving funds eachyear and what the income is going to befrom taxes there has to be a way to wellI don't want to say control theimmigration but I do think thatimmigration needs to be controlled ifyou're going to pursue social programsand so actually during this lastelection I was looking at Bernie Sandersand I realized hey if Bernie Sanderscame out and said that he'sfor socialized medicine and free collegebut that we have to close the bordersthen I would vote for him but that's aproblem you can'tin my opinion mathematically have openborders and have any of the socialprograms of Democrats proposed and to methat's very dishonest and I don't likedishonesty and I think that that hasmade a lot of sickness for a lot ofpeople I think another thing that I justwant to mention is the whole fear ofcoming out I actually wanted to come outa long time ago and the truth is is thatI didn't because I had already had someharassment I posted a Jill Stein articleon my Facebook page and the people frommy friend the school that I went to thishippie school peace love and happinessactually got on my page on the page thateverybody else could see and post it tome saying that I was a racist because Iwasn't supporting Hillary Clintonbecause I posted a anti-war piece ofliterature about Jill Stein well why Imean that's that's really harassmentit's really bad and you know maybe thesewere trolls okay maybe I you know maybeit was a trick but I can tell you rightnow that the whole idea of beinganti-war is something that's veryimportant to me and it's just sohypocritical I know that they weren'ttrolls actually because they went to myschool and I exact I know exactly whothey were so who would hire them to dothat but I'm just saying there's so muchharassment right now it's hard tobelieve that it's all real it's justthere's so much of it and the censorshipI mean that's another reason why Ididn't vote for Hillary Clinton wasbecause she had it so that Pepe the Frogwas a hate symbol and that hate symbolmeant that my kid who knew about Pepe heknew about the meme couldn't wear at-shirt with the Pepe meme on it toschool because people thought that itwas a Nazi symbol and I mean when Istarted explaining to my children aboutall these things they can't say atschool because people will think thatthey're racist they started to say to mewhat are you saying that we have to hideour views because people willmisunderstand us and now this year witheverything that's happenedit's starting to remind me of you knowmy ancestors who had to hide the factthat they were Jewish or when my mothermary did you how she got into so muchtrouble and that my father who grew upJewish his mother tried to hide the factthat she was Jewish and that people knewthem they wouldn't let anybody know thatthey were Jewish and this whole idea ofhiding your identity is just I mean Idon't believe in identity politics Idon't like them but I certainly don'tthink that anybody should have to hidewho they are or what they believe unlessit's harmful unless what your view is isyou know I don't know I want to go killpeople or something like that that's badso I mean I could go on for a long timebut I just wanted to say how grateful Iam for this movement and I hope thatother people are gonna be making morevideos and I feel like now if somethinghappens if I get harassed for makingthis video I do feel a lot stronger andI really appreciate the people who havetaken the risk for all of us thank you
the Democratic Party now in Virginia isadvocating letting women go full termdelivering babies and then having theoption to abort this is just anotheranother reason why I walked away fromthe Democratic Party back in the 90s theClintons were the last Democrats I votedfor and I've been a Republican eversince and I believe in Republican valuesGod country freedom and I cannotadvocate abortion I cannot support anyparty that advocates for abortionsupports Planned Parenthood or theDemocratic Party Schumer Pelosi they'reall just animals it's gotten to be sucha barbaric barbaric Society what we'redoing to our babies the New Yorkers areapplauding this but this is a typical ofwhat's going on and it's too bad peoplearen't sitting up and paying attentionbut my name is Aloha and I'm an ArgonianI'm retired mother and grandmothergreatest gift I ever have is my childrenand just to think that we live in asociety when we allow people toterminate pregnancies and kill babieslive it's just heartbreaking so I am onthe campaign with you guys I walked awayand I encourage all my friends andfamily that pay attention to what'sgoing on stand up for righteousnessanyway Aloha signing out[Music]
my hashtag walkaway storyhey it's prince of queens and I supposeI'm gonna hop on the bandwagon and tellthis story so that people don't have towatch my channel from beginning to endas in a lot of ways my channel hasbasically been one big walkaway storyborn in 1982 I was raised a Democrat inSeattle Washington I was told thatReagan was bad and that bush senior wasbad I remember being a kid and beingexcited when I saw Bill Clinton on TVdue to the fact that he seems likeableenough that he could win and he was oneof the good guysbut of course I didn't know anythingabout politics when he won in 1992 as Iwas 10 years old I remember the Clintonera very fondly probably due tonostalgia for my youth but also becauseI lived in Seattle in the 1990s whenSeattle was actually pretty awesome thegrunge thing died by the mid 90s inSeattle but we had an awesomeunderground electronic music scenefueled by a lot of young tech money itshould also be of note that I came outas homosexual in 1996 at the young ageof 14 when the AIDS crisis was certainlyfar from overand people were very openly hostiletowards gay men very regularly at thetime the Democrats did a good job ofpandering to us so it was natural toside with them on election night in 2000I went to sleep thinking that Al Gorehad won and then woke up to find that hedidn't and it was greatly depressing butalso then easy for me to ignore becauseby then I was a college student in NewYork City I had a lot going on andpeople didn't obsessively talk aboutpolitical issues on social media like wedo now in fact we didn't even reallyhave social media besides bulletinboards and mailing lists so I justthought okay we have a dumb hick in theWhite House I'll just pretend likethat's not the case by 2004 I was angrythat the Iraq war happened but didn'tthink that Bush would get reelected Ididn't actuallyREME that he would get reelected butwhen he did I was super pissed ateverybody in a similar way to how I amnow mainly towards the left because Ididn't really know right-wing people andit was because leftists were largelyjust really stupid in my opinion and Iwas also annoyed with the gay communityfor focusing on the fact that Bushwanted to preemptively ban gay marriagefrom the Constitution when I figuredfocusing on the war was a betterargument against Bush however afterbeing super angry about the Bushadministration for a year or two afterhis election I majorly burnt out onthinking about politics and thus decidedthat it wasn't good for my mental healthto care much about politics so instead Ifocused on my music and fictionalwriting type things which I continued todo from the years of around 2005 through2015 I pretty much never talked aboutpolitics on purpose thus when Obama wentup for election I was really reallyhappy that a well-spoken progressiveblock guy stood a chance of winning butultimately that was about as muchthought that I gave it as it was reallykind of like when I was a kid and I wasstoked about Bill Clinton truthfully ifI'm gonna be honest and self reflect abit my unquestioned support of Obama wasan act of racism from my part I stupidlyfigured that he was a minority that wason the good team that always said thatthey stuck up for gay people soobviously he must be a good guy that wasdoing good things because he's blackafter all I gave him the benefit of thedoubt because I was being racist still Inever questioned that the Democrats werethe good guys the Republicans were thebad guysand even though everything seemed to getworse and worse during the Obama yearsand I didn't see the economy improve Iwanted to help them stay in powersure housing was unaffordable in everycity that I visited and the people wholived in the non affordable apartmentswere also generally in massive studentdebtand working corporate jobs that theydidn't want to be working but the mediasure said that there was money but itwas just going to the 1% so I figuredthat things were unfair I didn't realizethat the drastic majority of newproperty being built in places like SanFrancisco and Seattle was owned byforeign investors of course which is whythe illusion of a growing economyactually seemed fairly plausible from myvantage point but live and learn Isupposefinally the 2016 presidential campaignstarted to really get heated in 2015 andI got extremely engaged I started outbeing a hardcore Sanders supporter as Iassumed that the Republicans were evilas that had been programmed into mesince birth and I thought he must betelling the truth about the economyhaving grown but the money simply goingto the 1% that's what Sanders said itmade sense to me from my vantage point Ididn't know that the economy growing waslargely just propaganda I didn't knowany how it was around the time that Istarted supporting Sanders that I alsohad issues with the Democratic Party forthe first time I was promptly labeled aBernie bro for supporting him and thenviciously attacked repeatedly andpublicly on Facebook by people I hadonce considered friends due to the factthat I wasn't supporting Hillary Clintoneverybody always just said HillaryClinton is more realistic she knows moreabout economics and you're a misogynistwhich granted maybe was actually true -the misogyny part but the problem wasthat they could never tell anybody whyshe knew more about economics and thatwas probably because then they wouldhave to admit that the Democratic Partywas lying about the economy for the pastfour or five years no instead HillaryClinton's campaign errs relentlesslyfell back on allegations of sexism - mudsling anybody who supported either Trumpor Sanders that said it was very clearto anybody paying attention that Sandershad far more actual support than Clintonand so I predicted very early on thatthe DNC wasn't going to let him get thenomination and of course I ended upbeing right about that because you knowthe DNC had all the money and who wasthis random guy from Vermontthat wasn't even a Democrat really so Itold all my friends Sanders will becheated out of the nomination and thenTrump will beat Clinton because ifpeople didn't already hate her whichthey mostly did anywaythey'll certifiably hate her after shecheats Sanders out of the election soyou have to make sure that Sanders winswell I was blocked and unfriended byhundreds of people for saying suchthings usually after they called me amisogynist and it kind of pissed me offas a result of being called a misogynistone too many times by Clinton supportingfeminists and a few other things thathappened in my life I started reallylooking into feminism in terms ofhistory theory and contemporary feministorganizing and my jaw dropped for aboutthree months straight you see I hadalways been under the impression thatfeminism had mostly good arguments and Ifigured that the people who prioritizedfeminism as an argument ahead of theactual policy differences that Clintonwas proposing were simply choosing a badstrategy by focusing too much on thefeminist part when there might be betterthings to talk about well it turned outthat I was wrong but not in that thefeminist argument was a good oneno I was assuming that it was a goodargument that they shouldn't be spendingtoo much time focusing on but it turnedout that it was beyond a weak argumentthat they should have never brought upat all because it wasn't just flawed butrather the reverse of what is true thusI learned over the course of the nextfew months after that that feministswrong about basically every currentissue besides the fact that they shouldbe allowed to show their nipples inpublic and have access to some forms ofbirth control that they might be deniedin places like Oklahoma or somewherelike that in fact it turns out that thefeminists have a heinous grip on Westerngovernments media academia and primaryschools and they are actively opressingmen in numerous ways and then fightingto make things worse for males andcalling it social justice I was appalledand embarrassed to have ever beenassociated with the party of feminismthus when my prediction about Sandersbeing robbed of the nomination came trueand the election came down to Clintonversus Trump I tried to tell people youguys Clinton is definitely gonna loseher only argument is that people shouldvote for her because it's the feministthing to do but once anybody examinesfeminism critically they'll realize thatit's a bunch of BS well once again I hada lot more faith in my friends than manyof them deserved because they did nottake that very well they called me crazyoften unfriended me and were generallyreally unpleasant and I continued tolose hundreds of friends on Facebookthough I never considered quitting withthe speaking of my mind because I guessthat's what type of guy I am still thefunny thing is that even after all ofthis I was still thinking that maybe Iwas a Democrat and that maybe I wouldprefer : chin to trump in spite of thefact that I was starting to secretlyroot for him when he embarrassed her inthe debates and I was meeting more andmore people who were Republican Trumpsupporters who were totally nice stilldespite the fact that I was starting tofeel like Trump probably wasn't actuallyhomophobic or really even racist atleast not compared to the relentlesslyracist and growingly homophobicDemocrats I was still holding on to somebelief that I was maybe a Democrat insome wayand they just had a bad candidate at themoment well there was a straw that brokethe camel's back for me and that's whenthe Clinton campaign worked with theanti-defamation league to declare Pepethe Frog to be some sort of racistright-wing hate symbol which was theworld's most popular internet meme atthe time and that's when they simplywent too farthis wasn't just a problem for me as anindividual being that I had shared theimage countless times when people hadmade fun ecaptionsand drew slight alterations on thecharacter but I was annoyed becausecountless left-leaning people had beenusing it for literally years and yearsbefore the election and yet I saw someof those same people fully drinking thekool-aid and believing that maybe itreally was a far-right racist symboleven though they were just sharing itthe previous week I mean seriously thefact that Clinton thought it was a goodidea to basically call the entireInternet including countless of her ownsupporters some sort of far-rightracists because they shared funny memesof a cartoon character on Facebook orTwitter and worst the fact that she hadthe power to get a supposedlyrespectable organization to corroboratethe story and say that it was true wellthat was just scary especiallyconsidering people are so incrediblyterrified of standing up to thepolitical correctness of the left thatthey were thinking to themselvesoops I guess I shared a racist meme onaccident instead of thinking tothemselves no Pepe the Frog is not ahate symbol it's the most popularcartoon meme on earth you wannabefascistic lunatic at that point Istarted calling hillary clinton hillarystalin regularly and Nan apologeticallyand from that point onward i toldeverybody that i was a full-blownnever Hillary type person and I willnever regret that decision because Iwill not live in a world where theleader of my nation can declare acartoon frog used by basically everybodya hate symbol and has the power to getpeople to believe it because it's notjust the anti-defamation league thatwill do the Democrats bidding they alsohave the SPLC and basically all ofmainstream media in their pocket thatwas basically my official walk awaymoment because I voted independent inthe election and the Democrats have justgotten worse and worse ever sincereminding me that I made the rightdecisionnone of this is surprising to mylongtime subscribers but I hope otherpeople find it interesting I am NOT aRepublican and I have no idea how Imight vote in the future but I doubtI'll ever be a Democrat again

I've neverliked Hillary I grew up on the EastCoast but I've lived in Arkansas in theOklahoma area since I was in my youngteensand I was really excited until he got totalking and when he got to talking Imean he was so charming he was he was socharming but this is gonna sound sostupid but I could not vote for Barackbecause Barack reminded me myex-boyfriendhis mannerisms his his way of speakinghis facial expressions his smirk it'snot built for Barack Obama not becausehe was black but because you reminded meof my ex who was a snake charmer he wassomebody that you would want to believehe was so charming but he was so fakeand such a liar and three and that's whyI didn't vote for not because he wasblack um but because he reminded me ofMichael Todd anyhow so I didn't vote forhim and at that time though still I'venever felt like I had to be quiet orhide what I felt who I voted for and Iwas still like I said I was still kindof democratic but I was learning I wasreading I was getting really involvedwith the things started happening duringhis administration and fast and furiousin Benghazi and at the Affordable CareAct and all the executive orders it wasjust I really started paying attentionand then Trump happens and I thoughtthat was a joke I was initially a neverTrumper this was not serious this guy'spersonality is just Oh and then um butwe had a lot to choose from that you hadCruz and Ben Carson I was I really likedBen Carson I liked Rubio I liked I likedCruz didn't like Champa um wasn't gonnavote for Hillary had learned enoughresearching I wasn't gonna vote forBurnie I'm not voting for socialism evenif you throw the word Democratic infront of it so but we had a lot tochoose fromuntil Trump won the Republican ticketand I was like oh my lordthis can't be happening I eventuallyjust got really quiet you know and Icould see people starting to freak outsee it going wild see people gettingvery very very mmm bizarre and um but Iwasn't gonna vote for Hillary ever everevershe's just a corrupt lying she just allkinds of wrong and I know as a womanthat makes means I voted against mywomanhood or whatever but Hillary wasjust evil evil and I wasn't gonna votefor us when I got in the booth I kind ofhad to plug my nose and vote it wrongand honestly I didn't think he was gonnawin of course that's what the polls toldus but that low behold he did win andthen the whole world went crazyit went insane and I went from feelinglike I could discuss my opinions and mythoughts and I had some really reallygood debates with people people havechanged my mindwhen I've seen different things alongthe way one way or the other I can't dothat anymore on my Facebook page Ipretty much until this campaign happenedhad not said anything I've been afraid Ilive in Oklahoma see this Oklahomabehind me see that's my yard and I'm andour business is right over the stateline in Arkansas and believe it or not Iknow most people may think while redneckhillbillies but our area is extremelydiverseI've always looked at a person as aperson that's just who I amI've never bought into that victimnarrative that you had that you weresomehow impressedyou're as oppressed as you allowyourself to be you are as unequal notequal to somebody else as you allowyourself to be I've always looked andthought and I don't know why some peoplewant to think that they aren't asvaluable or worthy but I've neverbelieved that a black person was lessthan a white person or Hispanic personwas less than a white person neverthey're just as valuable and and worthyand capable and talented as anintelligent as anybody else and that'swhy I moved to conservatism a lot ofpeople on the Left believed that that'swhat the liberal platform was that couldthat's what they told everybody it wasit wasn'twhat's the conservative platform equalopportunities for all the they fight forthe individual they believe in a securecountry and a stable economy and yes wedo have some Republicans on our side whoare extreme who had who areanti-american in my opinion which is whyI don't actually say I'm a RepublicanI'm a conservative and we have our ownissues too but in the conservativeplatformI think yep you guys are beginning tofind out but I found out a couple yearsago anyways that they are the mostwelcoming and inclusive and diverse andreal freedom in real individuality theywant you with them even if you don'tagree it's a lot more tolerant andrespectful in real ways so that's why Iwalked awayand I encourage you to to to as wellsorry just walk away from the hate fromthe violence from the vitriol um whereyou end up walking to is it that's yourchoice you don't have to become aRepublican you can become whatever youwant it's your journeywe're just here to support you andencourage you along the way and to walkwith you
so this is my reason for walking awayfrom Democrats and the Green Party so Ididn't once vote for Obama but the firsttime he ran I voted for Gary Johnson andthe second time he ran I voted for JillStein and for a little while there I wasthe Northwest Missouri representativefor the Green Party and I'm not sure whyexactly I felt like the values that theysupporter all good the main reason Iwalked away is because I think thatillegal immigration is a big problem inour countryI'm all for immigration but there's aprocess that has to be followed and it'sin place for a really good reason and ithelps us protect American citizens fromcrime and unnecessary taxes that drainour ability to support the lives that wehope to have the dreams that we aspirefor and I just felt that the older Imean the older that I'm I get the themore conservative I feel that I'mgetting and also likemost of my friends are very far left ofme I would say that I'm conservative nowbut I would say that most of the peoplethat I have on my life social mediafriends and the people that I hang outwith in my real life are very social ornot social but they're socialists and Idon't know like I used to think thatthose things were good but I just can'tget behind all these people they werekind of like social justice warriors andall their ideals are ill founded anduneducated and they all just believeeverything that the media is tellingthem and the media is not there for usthe media is there to spread theiragenda and their propaganda and its mostof it isn't real and I just couldn'tfollow that anymore I'm all abouteducating myself and finding the truthand and the things that I believe in andI believe that our country is muchbetter off being not controllednecessarily but influenced byconservative values and there are thingsthat I don't agree with on both sideslike mm-hmmlike I said I'm not a socialist any morebut there are things that theRepublicans and other conservativesbelieve in and do that I don't agreewith also I don't think that we need tobe occupying basically every country onthe planet with our military bases Idon't think that we need to becontrolling women's bodies withdefunding Planned Parenthood I thinkthat it serves a really good purpose butI'm also pro-life and I'm gay andthat makes a lot of people shake theirheads and feel very confused and no Ijust I think everyone needs to take sometime to research what they believe inand what they follow because there's alot more going on behind the scenes thatwe're not aware of that we need to makeourselves aware of so that we can makeeducated decisions and vote with ourhearts and our minds instead of ourintuition and sometimes our intuitioncan lead us astray because it's veryit's very impacted by the ideals and thebeliefs of the people that we surroundourselves with so the reason I walkedaway is because I feel that I wasn'tgetting the whole story and I was tiredof being misled by a propaganda that isthere to make us scared and I don'tbelieve in instilling violence I thinkthat this is a good country and I'd liketo see it be better and I think that ourpresident is actually doing a prettygood job of that and I'm not afraid tosay that anywhere so that's the reason Iwalked awayyouso this is my reason for walking awayfrom Democrats and the Green Party so Ididn't once vote for Obama but the firsttime he ran I voted for Gary

good morning Patriots my name is TianaI'm from San Diego California and thisis my second walk away video um but whyI'm making this video this time isbecause um first things first is thatI've been going through a lot of lifechanges since I made my last walk awayvideo which wasn't that long ago to behonest but um I found out that I'm goingto be a mommy and so it made me thinkabout the type of America that I want tobring my kid in um as a black Americanyou know we are told that the RepublicanParty is the party of racism and a bunchof other lies that honestly I can go onand on and on about this but I'm tryingto keep this video very brief but theone thing I want to point out is thatblack Americans I need you guys tounderstand that we are our own worstenemy we literally have become soattached to the color of our skin thatwe think that all skin folk are kinfolkthat all black people are for us that weall have the same fight that we all havethe same struggle that we are all goingthrough the same so-called oppressivenarratives that we have been handed so Ijust want to like nip that in the bud Imean but well not nip it in the bud butlike really try to break some of thisdown black people because we have becomeso obsessed with the color of our skinand become so think like a mob mentalityyou know whatever having and this is thefault of black politicians black mediapundits black black athletes blackcelebrities this is because of them theother issue that black people have istheir obsession with celebritiesso they use celebrity to sway blackpeople to think its own way and I findthat to be very disingenuous and it'skind of a sick mind game if you ask mebecause what black people are doing isthat they're these people that they loveand support they're these people aretelling you to go and vote a certain wayand then they're going to vote the waythat it just hurts them and wonder why Isay black people you're going to beyou're the cause of your own destructionif you guys continue on this path oflight yo all skin folk or kinfolk thatall black folks are for you when that'sjust absolutely not true especially youhave people like the Congressional BlackCaucus and n-double-a-cp which has beenruined by the way but when you havethese people who are part of thesegroups that actually don't care aboutyou they get paid to keep youdisenfranchised I mean I think it's timeto wake up to that there comes a pointin time where your ignorance has to stopyou know it there comes a point in timewhere you have to really you know seekout the facts the truth and the truth isthat like Booker Washington said thatthere is a group of people who a groupof black people a Negro race who keepsother black people down who keeps blackpeople in their grievances really in abook I was reading black lives matterthey talked about the race grievanceindustry where the race grievanceindustry literally is about keepingblack folks disenfranchised and it'sother black people like Al Sharpton andJesse Jackson who are helping to keepblack folks down at the end of the daythat's exactly what it is a lot of theseblack people also support you know theschool to Prison Pipeline you know stufflike that black people black politiciansupport these private prison industriesand a lot of you guys you know you guyscomplain about this stuff and you guysmake a big you know deal about this kindof stuff but then you're not pointingyour fingers at the right peoplepersonally I think it takes a lot ofself-reflection self accountability andall that to kind of really wake up andseethis truth black people do not want tobelieve that their own people areselling them out they refused blackpeople feasel to believe a lot of thingsabout history they used to believe youknow I'm saying like oh my god thatblack people can only be the only slavesever you guys stop it stop itonce slaves preceded black slaves beforeblack slaves even came to America butthat's a whole nother story for a wholenother day in in regardless of what alot of you might believe about thatstoryoh they were just indentured servants noplease try to get the facts on thatDemocrats have always wanted slaverythey've always wanted white slavery Imean listen there are congressionalrecords stating this stuff I've pointedthis out plenty of timeswhite slavery was a thing the point isis that we have black and whites elitesat the topwhose job is to keep us the massesblacks and whites disenfranchised offthe bottom so they all work together upthere and I just want to ask him incando you guys honestly believe that blackand white elites or up there you knowcrying about racism with each otherthey're not okay they're actuallylaughing at the rest of us for fallinginto their game so you know we cancontinue to fall into their game or wecan fight backI mean it's really up to us we can makeAmerica great again the other thing thatblack Americans need to realize to stopthinking that America was never greatfor black Americans that's a lot okaybecause right after slavery blacks werein Senate and in Congress they hadbusinesses they had oil mills they hadcasinos they had night clubs they hadbasketball teams they had baseball teamsthese are Negro Leagues okay they hadall of his stuff what happened you knowblack people have the potential to getall this stuff back and I really wishthat

hey guys this is Eddie Garcia I want toshare with you my walkaway story Iserved in the last class of White Houseinterns for President Obama whileserving I had multiple experiences thatjust did not sit right with me I startedto a rolled my image of the DemocraticParty I kept my head down and continuedto work past this trying to stay loyalto my friendshello to my party after leaving theWhite House I worked for senator BernieSanders while working on one of hiscommittees I started to run in moreliberal circles becoming more expose tothe agenda of the left the far left anda lot of these ideas just did not sitright with me but not only that but theextent of the ideas and par far theyplanned on taking it for example many ofyou think gun reform the Democrats andyou're thinking okay wellsemi-automaticsno problem and I'm here to tell youthat's not the case that's just thefirst step in a long series of steps totake away your right to bear arms littleby little the intent is to encroach onthat right and to me that's just notacceptable the right to bear arms is aconstitutional fundamental right and wemust protect it that's just one of thereasons why I've decided to leave theparty another reason why I've decided toleave the party is becauseof the recent censorship of individualslike Alex Jones and why you may notagree with his politics that's fine butthe man has a right to say it and I findit very unamericanand unacceptable that platforms likeFacebook and YouTube could colludetogether and all in just one day removea man like Alex Jones from practicinghis god-given right to freedom of speechand I know some of you may say it's aprivate platform it's a private companyor what-have-you but I think todayYouTube Facebook these are themodern-day public platforms and theyshould be treated as such and it's notacceptable I believe that the DemocraticParty has sold us out whatever happenedto the idea of freedom of speech andmarketplace of ideas aren't they thebedrock of our society I'm here to tellyou that the Democratic Party is notgoing to hoodwink us there will beblowback for this intership comeNovember and I find it odd thatindividuals like Alex Jones would becensored or shadow banned a few monthsbefore the midterms and the third andmain reason while I'm leaving theDemocratic Party is because they havelost sight of rural America andworking-class families middle-classfolks just trying to get by theDemocratic Party has become a party ofEast Coast and West Coastelites that have no regard for ruralAmerica and just consider them flyoverStatesno wonder Trump won because theDemocratic Party is just not payingattention to the south into the Midwestand they're gonna continue to sufferbecause of that you got to get back tothe basics to looking out for everydayAmericans and improving their quality oflife I can't tell you how many timeswhile at the White House I interjectedwith the bringing up the needs of ruralAmerica for working-class families andparticularly with working-class familieshow that was just kind of pushed asidewasn't importing and that's just notacceptable every state contributes toour great nation not just the East Coastand the west coast every statecontributes another major reason why I'mleaving the Democratic Party is becausethere just seems not to be a willingnessto debate the issues without resortingto labeling and instead of callingpeople races bigots misogynist orwhateverrather than having a constructive debatenow call a spade a spade if someone's aracist then call them a racist butreserve that term for actual racistactual bigots I feel that these labelsare being thrown particularly from theleft as a way to silence people becauseyou don't agree necessarily with theirworldview and that's not acceptablewe've got to be able to get comfortableagain with sharing our ideas anddiscussing the issues you know I pray Ihonestly pray that eventually the UnitedStates returns to some degree ofnormalcy and that both Democrats andRepublicans can get back to work workingon the issues but I don't see thathappening anytime soon particularly fromthe left they need to be willing to

the first time I voted was for Al Gorethen I voted twice for Obama but in the2016 election I voted for[Music]to parties and the reason I walked awayfrom the progressive left is becausethey've been lying to two black peoplein this country for a long time you comehere to this countryexcuse me getting hot you come to thiscountryand in Cuba they sell you this um thispropaganda they still back in 1998 theywere telling my mom that you can't takeyour black son over there becausethey're going to you know flower firehose and they're going to sick dogs onthem you know German Shepherds then Iget over here and things are obviouslynot that way different you know I I wasable to you know there are a scholarshipto go to college you know I took thestate standardized tests here in Floridahaving been born in a non Englishcountry and passed it just fine butthere was something you know that reallywas curious and that was that you know alot of like you know black parents werecomplaining that the F Codd was not fairto black people that the language theyused was somehow not was a word I don'tremember but basically it was not thelanguage that black people were used toso he was a racist test you know the SATwords were somehow not even though theywere English words and that you couldstudy which is what I did you know andthey gave you prep I mean they gave youf cut prep you just have to do yourhomework with the little storieswhatever take the test like multiple thethe prep the prep exam just gotta takeit a couple of times which is what youdid if you were in class because theywill stop teaching they will startteaching subjects that we were supposedto learn in high school so that youcould you know take these F cut prepexams and that's why are you then andthen you would pass it just fine so thishappened you know with not just like youknow black humans like me and all theLatinos Haitians as well so I didn'tunderstand thatso I always you know enjoyed the DailyShow you know I always thought that youknow George Bush was you know this sillyguy or we have a dumb president startingwars here and there but then a couple ofthings that Obama did really made mechange my mind and that was the Irandeal which was strange because you knowI followed a lot of atheists andsomething happened in that communitywhere it was okay to criticizeChristianity all the time but then itwas racist and immigrant dashing to saythat people that believed in Islam werea problem in Europeyou know this is after charlie a dogthis is after Salman Rushdie had to gointo hiding after was the nameafter you know the numbers came outabout um female genital mutilation allthe bombings after 9/11 after severalyou know just a preponderance ofevidence that even though you know youcould say that all religions don't haveany basis in reality some were currentlyright more of a problem or more dangersand others after the shooting in Orlandoin the indicate club people Democraticpoliticians couldn't even say that itwas Islamic terrorism later on day afterpulling teeth I think Hillary admittedthat it was Islamic terrorism orsomething like thatand number twoit was Cuba relationsObama you know that the opening theconcessions that we the the USgovernment made with Cuba I was franklyI was hopeful and then my my dad likethrough some cold water on me basicallysaid this will change nothing son beingolder for for things to change in thatisland these people need to die if youhave ruled an island as a dictatorshipfor so long you've had to kill tortureand just basically violate human rightsand committing justices for like whatwas it like it's been already like 60years or around 60 years your neck youcannot concede look at what happened inEgypt you know you cannot cede an inchor the that the 11 million people inCuba will rise up and crush you likethey didn't like Gaddafi I mean he wasraped with a knifeI believe so you they cannot give uppower in that island and just becauseObama said that you know let's holdhands and let's let's be friends itmeans nothing what did the enough andwhat did the Cuban government do do theywipe their ass with the concessions thatObama made and what now just recentlythey may have actually like attackedsome US diplomats you know some of themare deaf nowso you know so Cuban as an atheist somethings were not squaring you know thelogic was not consistent on theprogressive left side of thingsand then I think the clincher was theaddicting hood mentality that Democratspush the welfare state I know what awelfare state is like a real welfarestate and the bark community has a lotof the ills that Cuba has you know it'slike a little microcosm of communismthey're literally called the blackcommunity word and when you when youhear about how can we help the blackcommunity how come the black communityof itself there is a collectivist likean inherent collectivist label that allblack people get in this country that isvery like I don't see anybodyquestioning that you know what aboutindividualism what about each personlike I was thought trying to be betterevery dayhow come this the Democratic Party isalways separating people into groups andthenselling the notion that collectivism isthere is a way of go that really made mepause because the success that I've hadin life has not been collective it hasbeen my success and thanks to theteachings and the help of my family andfriends you know if you're gonna becollective fine be a collective in termsof family but you're gonna lump everyonein together from Washington DC toWashington State from color for to NewYork to your sexuality or your yeah youshare you know a nation of origin or acolor of skin you're gonna lump everyonelike that together strangeI don't see them having the love ofAmericans a heart I think they're justtrying to perpetuate themselves in powerandI think that it's time that everyoneeveryone really thought critically whathas the Democratic Party done for thiscountryrightI'm not telling you to goyou know vote Republican just becauseI'm not telling you to to votelibertarian which is what I ammonitoring what I am telling you toconsider if you may if you want tothe facts andthink about the things in common withall the the socialist dictatorships thatthe Democratic Party is pushing forright think about that welfare because Iget triggered as a given you know I'mgonna get triggered whenever I hear freehealth care health care and Cuba is notgreat for people for the common personyou know the Michael Moore documentarywas ridiculously stupid and biased Imean there's openthere's hospitals with open sewage withroaches with rats with no sheets with noequipment with no electricity in Cubaall right you have to take your ownpillows and your own mattresses to thehospital and they don't have sometimesin Hammonds t-shirt education in Cuba isgreat when it comes to like math Spanishyes but and even actually and science Iwould say but there's no actual businesscourses so you can't you don't know howto make a buckand then even the science or themedicine you know it it's not that greatwe export these doctors but how many ofthem are are exposed to the newtechnologies all the new discoveriesthat we have you know and then the illsof socialism can be seen in you knowhere in in the drug use of like even aNative Americans and black people thesame thing in Cuba everyone is analcoholic a lot of there's a lot ofalcoholics in Cuba just trying to sootheaway the misery on the painyou know the the demoralization thecrime the theft the breakdown of thefamily same thing the malnutrition themalnutrition so just just think aboutwhat these the Socialists are pushingare trying to push here in this countryoh and of course they don't want to getrid of guns which is what Castro andChavez did in Cuba and Venezuelarespectively the use of propagandathese people are are evil and downthere's no other way cause I don't thinkthey're dumb and I don't think they'reuninformed so that just leaves thembeing evil those are my two centsyou
ever since I discovered the walkway ofcampaigning probably maybe six weeks totwo months after it started I just beenfeeling really really good about beinghonest with where I'm at and where Istand with my political views andbeliefs and everything you know growingup I always thought black folks had tobe Democrat all you know why but Ialways felt on the inside in hindsight Ireally was always moderate with lessleanings you know for some of you thatdon't know that means basically my lifeand my beliefs have always really beendown the middle but my thoughts and myactions were left leaning as far associal justice and trying to step upracism and embracing the gay and lesbianbisexual transgender community righteverything just really trying to be fewminutes and always possible but mypersonal life was moderate leaningtowards conservative you know I'm in atraditional marriage I got marriedbefore I had a child and everything andI'm kind of modest in my dress most ofthe timewith the exception of profanity filledmouth on occasion I'm just pretty muchtry to be a lady about this I guessthat's the best way to explain itso anyways back to what this countryneeds to me it means a whole lot Brandonyou are like my hero man I would love tomeet you Hyundai because you just brokeout and said man I'm just walking awayyou poured your heart out and that'swhat grabbed me and during my journey Ihave met some amazing friends I metpeople Republicans libertarians who werejust standing on partial and evenDemocrats who leaned more towards themoderate side that acknowledged that theDemocratic Party is very pragmatic andthey want to solve the problems in theirown party I had just met so many amazingpeople who they may have differentbeliefs in me I guess you I can't evensay I'm a self-described atheist I willsay that I'm agnostic but I respecteverybody's paintings you're a Christianyou're Catholic and Buddhist you'rewhoever I don't care I don't mind youpraying for me I appreciate that out ofmy positive thoughts energies whatever Ireally don't care I will love you forwho you areI will love you put a condom at yourcharacter not the color of your skin notyour gender or not whatever sexualpreference you have I've never reallycared about that I will say that losingfriends had hurt like really bad some ofthem I had really lost since I am nowthat I had walked away from theDemocratic Party I'm no longer aDemocrat island there would be aDemocrat ever again you know to thepoint of tears and I know most of youhad experienced that and been throughthat with friends and even familymembers fortunately my family they don'tcare they love me no matter what thenthis is like you know just be happy justlive your life you're still a goodperson you're still the same toy that weknow and love but the ones that I'velost I guess in hindsight they weren'treally friends because how a month agoyou were they were happy that I'm havinga second child and you know they werepraising me for my confidence and myoutspoken attitude and telling me howgreat I am that I'm being honest andoutspoken as soon as I say I walked awayfrom the Democratic Party and I pointout truths and evidences as to theidentity politics and the victimmentality that the Democratic Partypushes all of a sudden I'm a clone andword race traitor one of the even is sofar as to go saying than saying oh I'm aRussian by okay so I'm not human nowreally okay Russian box first of alldon't have babiessecond of all Russian Box do not go tothe hospital you hooked up to IVsbecause they have pancreatitisokay so and one who thinks I'm rushingby I think it's funny now I'm like letme go any name-calling although it'sobvious the Russian bought the Russiancollusion has just lost all strength andthose who think that just looks soridiculous in my eyes really do get offtrack a little bit back to the journeyerI have my journey our new friends I feelat peace with myself ever since I walkedaway I mean I never felt such atremendous American spike and living mymost authentic life and I have studiedthis previously and I will always takethis my walk away moment was today ofpresident Trump's inauguration Oh sameday I found out I was pregnant with myfirst child and my first child will be ayear oldon this 20th so less than three weeksfrom now my little miracle baby Carol isgonna be a year old and I got anothermiracle inside of me this campaign isimportant because man we have got tomake a better future for our childrenour moment I found out I was going to bea mom ever it just really hit me youknow what because I'm going to be a momI am going with child I'm going to be amotherI'm going to be responsible for howthey're going to grow up and I love theymean the world to me I do anything thatI possibly can to help make this world abetter place for them I will raise mybabies to be free thinkers ourweightless ladies to be smart I'll raisemy babies away from the impact narrationof schools on homeschooling my childrenbecause I know these public schools theyare trying to indoctrinate our childrento socialism and trying to get them intothe institutionalized way of thinkingespecially after they get out of highschool and go to college now mind you ifmy children do decide to go to college Iwould support whatever they want to dobut I also want them armed withknowledge I also want them to be able tomake their own decisionsnice outsidenegative influence as possible I know Ican't protect them from everythingI just want to arm them with truth andknowledge and the more I becomeknowledgeable about sorry emotion themore become knowledgeable about politicsand didn't fall and activism andeverything so better parent I can be Ifeel that I feel I could be a betterparent this is importantno matter what my children shoes I justwant them to be armedand I want them to go into this world asyour thoughts as freaking theories asloving kind children who didn't grow upwith the victim mentality like I did dadwon't fall into the trappings ofidentity politics and men climbingeverything else that the DemocraticParty has been carrying and it saddensme that the Democratic Party has reallyreally deteriorated into this because Iguess because growing up I had alwaysfelt that the Democratic Party was on myside now I feel like maybe they werenever on my sidewalk away friends and your associateskeep sweeping up keeps peeking out myofficial political affiliation now islibertarian and I feel that it is bestfor me maybe I'll jump to the Republicanside I'm kind of itching towardsRepublican leanings but right now I'mlibertarian he saw that's why I meantright now
okay my walkaway story well as aclassical liberal I suppose I neverwalked anywhere but the modern leftlurched away from me so here I still sitas a classical liberal and you might bewondering what differentiates the twofirst I believe in empiricism overideology empiricism is a rigorousendeavor it's a search for the truth atruth that can be replicated as a realpattern in the physical world ideologyon the other hand acts cultish for lackof a better word members must guard thetruth no matter how false no matter howpreposterous no matter how it odds withmaterial reality I believe in debatingideas great ideas are not only open toscrutiny but welcomed scrutiny bad ideascan only thrive when they are notchallenged they can never be exposed tothe light of inquiry therefore bad ideasmust silence all challenges how bylabeling the challengers as bad peopleyou must destroy their character if Ithrow out an idea that is it odds withyour concept of reality for instance Isay three plus three equals ten andsomeone challenges that idea I don'thave a lot of options I can't argue themerits of three plus three equals ten sowhat do I dowhen I reach into my grab bag Wow oneclever way of doing it is to label youdiscredit you accuse you of somethingheinoussilence you because you see my ideathree plus three10 I want that to move forward it's myideology if you come at me with factsyou're gonna ruin my my three plus threeequals ten I cannot have that so I mustsilence you second I believe inindividuality I believe people should bejudged on the content of their characterand not on their immutablecharacteristics those characteristicsthat cannot change to prejudge people onimmutable characteristics is ultimatelyawful and it can lead to awful things aswe've seen throughout history toattribute an adjective to a set ofpeople based on immutablecharacteristics is is regressive itignores human nature it divides humanityinto groups who may or may not haveanything in common there are otherfactors I believe in personalresponsibility and that's number three Ido not subscribe to an ideology thatwould absolve me of personalresponsibility look down on me expectless of me how condescending turn meinto a victim turn me into a pawn or apet no there is no currency in sloughingoff personal responsibility that's wherereal empowerment liesI am wholeheartedly responsible for myactions likewise I'm not responsible foryour actionsnot today not tomorrow and certainly notyesterday I believe number four inmodernity and that includes science andscience includes biology and geneticsand all the implications and so in thatI am NOT a postmodernist and while it's fun to look atsomething in a variety of wayswe must not demonize logic logic againis empirical it's based on evidence thatcan be duplicated again and again apattern that proves true again and againtwo and two still equals four and wecannot be compelled to say otherwisewithout losing our safety or our sanityif you compel me to say that two plustwo does not equal four you're robbingme of my sanity and my safety no onewants to step on a bridge or an airplanedesigned by an engineer who decided thathey there's just ya know two plus twoequals four I don't think so I'm justgonna make up my own equation two plustwo equals seven would you step on thatairplane with those measurements thosedimensions no doubtful our safetydepends on facts and not random fictionstwo plus two equals four fiction howeverhas its place and that leads me to mymost important final point creativitycreativity is rooted in freedom ofexpression and freedom of expression isgrounded in freedom of speech that bigdoozy and as an author I take all threeof those very seriously I don't writefiction to push ideology to indoctrinateto force no I I write it because I musthopefully it'll reflect human nature insome way maybe it'll inspire or maybeentertain so recently while pitching afuture novel online so social mediaoutrage mob authoritariansdecided they did not like my characterand her attitude towards her mainproblem which was her weightmy character is not happy about herweight not happy about her addictionsbut over the course of the novel shetakes personal responsibility for herlife for herself for her choices shelearns to make better choices there's anarc therethe authoritarians the hive mind feltthat she a dangerously obese womanshould be thrilled with her body the wayit wasthey said that 300 pounds is awesome nodifferent health-wise then someone who'sperfectly fit when I went through a listof the health implications for mycharacter the authoritarian suggestedseriously that obese people areoppressed oppressed not by their ownchoices no no no no no but by thepatriarchy and white supremacists thisis what I was told my fictionalcharacter is oppressed by whitesupremacists and they wanted me to writeher that way you get the gist of it thisis becoming predictable so politicalcorrectness in that case was literallynot polite not correct not helpful nothonest the ideological authoritariansreveled in their collective cruelty thatthey unleashed upon me as a unified hivemind in hopes of de railing mycreativity or having me rewrite thecharacter ultimately ideology makes usless smart than we might have been lessinquisitive less curious the answers arealready prehackage for us in the ideology we'reforced to demonize prejudge override ourown senses were forced into echochambers unwilling to engage with peoplewith ideas we are hermetically sealedand bound by our talking points we moveas a hive mind that's not for me no nono no words are still better than fistsand when people are terrified to speakabout their feelings and their opinionswhen they're afraid to explore they willdo so for better or worse in the privacyof the voting booth we are a commonhumanity made up of unique individualswho work together and thrive based onshared values and a foundation based andlogic and because we're grounded inlogic we can take flights of fancy everynow and againI'm hopeful that we're going to regainour footing I think we will but it takescourage it takes

haveanything in common there are otherfactors I believe in personalresponsibility and that's number three Ido not subscribe to an ideology thatwould absolve me of personalresponsibility look down on me expectless of me how condescending turn meinto a victim turn me into a pawn or apet no there is no currency in sloughingoff personal responsibility that's wherereal empowerment liesI am wholeheartedly responsible for myactions likewise I'm not responsible foryour actionsnot today not tomorrow and certainly notyesterday I believe number four inmodernity and that includes science andscience includes biology and geneticsand all the implications and so in thatI am NOT a postmodernist and while it's fun to look atsomething in a variety of wayswe must not demonize logic logic againis empirical it's based on evidence thatcan be duplicated again and again apattern that proves true again and againtwo and two still equals four and wecannot be compelled to say otherwisewithout losing our safety or our sanityif you compel me to say that two plustwo does not equal four you're robbingme of my sanity and my safety no onewants to step on a bridge or an airplanedesigned by an engineer who decided thathey there's just ya know two plus twoequals four I don't think so I'm justgonna make up my own equation two plustwo equals seven would you step on thatairplane with those measurements thosedimensions no doubtful our safetydepends on facts and not random fictionstwo plus two equals four fiction howeverhas its place and that leads me to mymost important final point creativitycreativity is rooted in freedom ofexpression and freedom of expression isgrounded in freedom of speech that bigdoozy and as an author I take all threeof those very seriously I don't writefiction to push ideology to indoctrinateto force no I I write it because I musthopefully it'll reflect human nature insome way maybe it'll inspire or maybeentertain so recently while pitching afuture novel online so social mediaoutrage mob authoritariansdecided they did not like my characterand her attitude towards her mainproblem which was her weightmy character is not happy about herweight not happy about her addictionsbut over the course of the novel shetakes personal responsibility for herlife for herself for her choices shelearns to make better choices there's anarc therethe authoritarians the hive mind feltthat she a dangerously obese womanshould be thrilled with her body the wayit wasthey said that 300 pounds is awesome nodifferent health-wise then someone who'sperfectly fit when I went through a listof the health implications for mycharacter the authoritarian suggestedseriously that obese people areoppressed oppressed not by their ownchoices no no no no no but by thepatriarchy and white supremacists thisis what I was told my fictionalcharacter is oppressed by whitesupremacists and they wanted me to writeher that way you get the gist of it thisis becoming predictable so politicalcorrectness in that case was literallynot polite not correct not helpful nothonest the ideological authoritariansreveled in their collective cruelty thatthey unleashed upon me as a unified hivemind in hopes of de railing mycreativity or having me rewrite thecharacter ultimately ideology makes usless smart than we might have been lessinquisitive less curious the answers arealready prehackage for us in the ideology we'reforced to demonize prejudge override ourown senses were forced into echochambers unwilling to engage with peoplewith ideas we are hermetically sealedand bound by our talking points we moveas a hive mind that's not for me no nono no words are still better than fistsand when people are terrified to speakabout their feelings and their opinionswhen they're afraid to explore they willdo so for better or worse in the privacyof the voting booth we are a commonhumanity made up of unique individualswho work together and thrive based onshared values and a foundation based andlogic and because we're grounded inlogic we can take flights of fancy everynow and againI'm hopeful that we're going to regainour footing I think we will but it takescourage it takes courage[Music]

so a lot of people have come forwardwith their stories about leavingI guess the Democratic Party or I thinkin some cases the broader left I wouldsay a lot of these people do belong theybelong on the left wing side of theaisle but simply the Democratic Partydoesn't fulfill any of their actualpolicy policy positions or beliefs Iwould say that that in my case thisstarted in the year 2000 I was probablyand you know to be fair I guess itstarted before I could fill now Al Gorewas running for president and of courseBush was running against him I was not Imean I was only 14 years old so Icouldn't vote anyway I probably wouldhave still not voted for Bushbut Gore's behavior during the campaignwas as if well I've gone through theseeight years I've suffered under BillClinton who couldn't keep his pants onand basically I deserve to be Presidentand everybody else should just fall inline and just let it go keep-keep agiven you know keep keep the party goingunder me you know I'm Al Gore doesn'tmatter that I don't have as much of theperson of a personality as Bill Clintonbut you know who are you gonna vote forthis redneck from Texas well in theevent you know the good the guy was adead fish and in fact during thecampaign he behaved exactly like a whatI'm talking about he but he behaved veryarrogantly as if the voters were toodumb to know the difference between youknow a real policy position a realvision for America and basically apolitical establishment and after theelection after of course he claimed thatit was stolen from him which you knowthere it's debatable the amount ofbutter and the amount of and then thelack of humility on his part you know hewent on SNL and everybody was sayingwell we should let him you know theythey made a mock-up of the Oval Officeand he was just lingering there as if hereally deserved to beand I know that was supposed to be aself-deprecating joke the message fromSNL at the time was that this is alegitimate president doesn't matter whatdoesn't matter the fact that he ran alackluster campaign didn't really standfor anything and nobody 11 me I stilldon't know what what Al Gore was tryingto propose back then and I probablywould have ended up voting for RalphNader at the time if I could vote 2004 Ididn't vote at all Ralph Nader was alsorunning but I didn't really see a pointin voting because I knew Bush would winand I considered myself a person of theleft I believed in environmentalism infact I believed in a lot of the you knowI still do believe in a lot ofconservation policies that I grew upwith you know we grew up in an era the90s people were talking about recyclingreusing all of that stuff it was areduce reuse and recycle every everyyear at school we talked about it youknow Captain Planet was on TVin reality the Democrats never reallyembraced environmentalism as a totalvision they really focused almostentirely on the global warming aspectand you know we see the result today butit's it's really a muddled vision nobodyknows what they mean about it and theninstead of proposing you know economicideas they'll help their you know thepoor among us they keep trying to makepoverty a permanent class you know theytry they try to create a system wherepeople are permanently poor and they'rehappy to be permanently poor andgradually that that's when I started tobecome a so sort of speak ofconservative I don't know if I as a fullconservative I'm for one thing I'm not aChristian and I also don't believe insome of the you know the foreign policybelieves the Republican Party I'magainst intervention in foreigncountries but in 2008 Ron Paul ran forpresident he really started having methink what is about thiscountry that we need to do to finallyfinally get it free from the burdens ofthe Cold War well we need to startbringing our troops home we need tostart cutting cutting spending we justcut start cutting defense spending RonPaul was a person who started reallygetting me towards a real economicvision of what conservatism really meansas opposed to some other writers I hadbeen reading at the time such as Larryalder and John Stosselthat you know they alluded to theeconomic theory but they weren't reallygoing and mapping it out so essentiallyyou know I have one person in the chatwho already mentioned it Ron Paul wasmistreated in the 2012 primary thatdoesn't really have to do with walkingaway from the Democratic Party but youcan see basically that the DemocraticParty has ceased to be democratic in2004 the election I didn't vote inHoward Dean was talking about how he'sthe leader of the Democratic wing of theDemocratic Party and that was just atthe time you know nowadays we haveactual documented proof that theDemocratic Party does not want people atthe bottom telling the people at the topwhat they want they want people tobasically swallow any policy that ismost convenient that will that will puttheir stock price you know get it up youknow they're a party that's that's justas married to Wall Street as the oldRepublican Party is and that's why a lotof people have decided to walk away it'snot because they want to become full-onconservatives in many ways it's becausethey want to just have a freedom tochoose somebody who closer most closelyadheres to their vision and I think Ithink that you know to talk about morebroadly what this means for theDemocratic Party what this means for thecountry it could mean in the long termjust the complete collapse of the partyas a whole in in some parts of thecountry you know I live in a state Ohiothen in 2010 the Democratic Partybasically fell completely apart and it'snever recovered because they don't theydon't replace people who have failedthey keep them going we've had asuddenly Fischer who's run for officehere several times never I don't thinkhe ever won he's ever won he's run forgovernor a couple times he's run forSenator I think now he's like on theBoard of Trustees of a university hereso you basically fail upward in theDemocratic Partythat's how Al Gore got it got it I meanhe failed he lost the primary in youknow 1992 they gave him the vicepresidency what did he do with the vicepresidency nobody [ __ ] knows huh sothen he he runs for president doesn'tbasically you know he basically strikesout on it and you know that then theymake him into a symbol of environmentalmovement which he doesn't deserve and Ithink that's really the problem with theDemocratic Party you don't you know theywere Ward failure with more and moreinfluence and money and and capabilityDonna Brazile has never worked in asuccessful campaign in her life sheworked on the Dukakis 88 campaign shewas the she I think she was verysuperficially involved in the Clintoncampaigns in the 90s then in 2000 shewas the chair of the gore campaign forpresident and they lost and then theyjust keep rewarding her why why do theykeep rewarding her because of what Imean because she's a veteran because sheknows how to do what exactly that'sthat's the mentality the DemocraticParty just keep rewarding failurebecause it's not whether the the policyactually succeeds it's not whether it'ssomething that actually helps peoplehave a better life it's about influenceand it's about votes and it's aboutbeing able to basically shake your assand make people think that you're thatyou're really something to believe inwhen in reality there's no substancebehind it that's why I decided to walkaway in 2000 and I don't I don't feellike I'm wrong and yeah it is aboutpower it's about you know I see a cuefrom the audience but it it's it's aboutpeople who don't have the courage torealize that what we said at the timewas basically meant nothing you know in2000 there was no vision in 2012 therewas no visionObama in 2016 there was no vision underHillary Clinton and that's the way thered Democratic Party seems to want it tobe so that's about it that's my walkaway storyyouso a lot of people have come forwardwith their stories about leavingI guess the Democratic Party or I thinkin some cases the broader left I wouldsay a lot of these people do belong theybelong on the left wing side of theaisle but simply the Democratic

way thered Democratic Party seems to want it tobe so that's about it that's my walkaway storyyou
howdy neighbors my fellow globalcommunity after all and the words of thered-green show we're all in thistogether although it doesn't seem likewe are based on the current state ofaffairs not just within our own countrybut around the world seems like we'reletting politics ideologies tear usapartmy name is Dewayne and this is my walkaway story and I want to thank first ofall Brandon for making this channelavailable this opportunity to tell mystory as well as others and I only hopethat through the telling of all thesestories that others would start to sinkon their own and start to analyze thesituation and walk away my story beginsin about 1994 74 sorry 1974I first joined the Teamsters Union inthe state that I have always resided inAlaska and in those days I was notinterested in politics I was moreinterested in fun and games partying andI was looking for means to make the mostmoney I could for the work I performedin order to continue the partying justkeeping it a hundred so as a member ofthe Union I was a good union member Idid as I was compelled by my leadershipvote Democrat they said the Democratsare our friends and so I did that wasvery dutiful I did as my masters ofcompelled me to do so we had a majorconstruction project up here at the timetrans-alaskan oil pipeline and so therewas jobs of plenty and it really didn'tmatter who was in charge who was incontrol what party wasn't role becausethe project was bigger than the politicsof time but at when that ended and wewent back to the hard money jobs Istarted noticing a trend and that trendwas that when the Democrats were incharge or in control both locallystatewide and nationwide jobs were fewerand harder to come by when theRepublicans were in control are inchargeI went to work jobs of plentywell this caused me to analyze what wasgoing on and as a result in 1980 I wokeup and I walked away from the DemocratParty I joined the Republican Party andthen in 1984 I left the Union I've got areal as a result of my woke miss if youwill using the modern vernacular forthat although I will say I don'tunderstand the the usage of it todaybecause it seems to me the people thatare using it to self-identify as beingwoke really are still in a deep sleep soto be truly awake are to be truly wokeyou need to realize the truth and so thetruth is that the Democrat Party is notthe working stiffs friend that's what Irealized and then I realized as Istarted analyzing a deeper and furtherand going you know beyond just myability to work but into philosophicalthings I started realizing that theDemocrat Party was not my friend andanything wasn't a friend of the theUnited States I realized as I educatedmyself that I I was essentially aconstitutionalist because I grew up in astate that breeds independence so I meanthat's the way I grew up the way my dadwas wouldn't take a handout from anybodymade sure that he provided using hishis hands his abilities that God gavehim to provide for his family and sothat's the way I grew upand that's kind of the way I've been andthat the Union took that away from me Iwas accustomed to going out and andhaving the employer used me in any meanspossibleto get the job done and it didn't matterwhether I was crossing Union boundariesI went out and got the job done if I manI jumped in jumped into a dump truck orjumped into a piece of equipment orgrabbed a hand shovel got the job donethat's the way we grew up up here butthat was countered to the Union and oneof the the disadvantages to the Union isyou you can only achieve a certain levelbased on the rules and guidelines set bythe Union well that didn't sit well withme I was a hard worker and through meritRTI through merit I wanted to earn myway and improve my financial situationthrough my efforts meritocracy there wego anyhowwell the Union stifles that and all yougot to do is look at the for an examplelet's look at the teachers unions rightonce they get tenure you can't get ridof them and it doesn't matter whetherthey're effective in fact you're goingto look at the record and see thatthey're not effective especially up herein Alaska we are we have the worstoutcomes right so the teachers get moremoney we spend more money on educationthan just about any other state with theworst outcomes so you know when youstart weighing those things it'll helpyou wake upI will say though that as a Republican Igot involved got elected to the co-chairmy local precinct then got elected tothe district chair position and then Iwent to a couple state conventions and Iwalked away from the Republican PartyI became an independent and I remainedthat way for several years three or fouryears ago I rejoined the RepublicanParty because I realized that you knowas an independent I really don't have avoice in anything I can just go voteright for whoever seems the bestcandidate but I wanted to be able tohelp the Republican Party get on thestraight path and so that's what I'mdoing and that's where I'm at now I'm aRepublican and essentially that's mywalk away story and I hope that thishelps somebody especially if you're inthe Union to sort of wake up smell theroses and recognize that there's adifferent side of the story then you'rebeing told and instead of just being aminion a rank-and-file go on in this amost socialistic enterprise unions rightI mean think about itright you have a collective I have abunch of people paying dues to an elitesmall group of people that spend theyour dollars advancing their ideologytheir causes and you're just out therejust doing the job yes sir yes ma'amwhatever it might beread the Constitution understand thatwhat's happening today is Liberty isunder attack even if we have it anymorebut Liberty is what this country hasalways been about I recognize we've hadsome very serious problems but I alsorecognize that it was this Constitutionthat we have that forms the style ofgovernment we have supposed to have thatbrought change 600,000 young men andboys old men died bringing an end toslaverythe one party that has remained resolutein combatting that change and bringingus together has been the Democrat Partyunderstand that our Constitution wasdesigned to bring the pluribus unumright from the many one what does thatmean that we're all one thinking oneminded no what it means is that I mightnot agree with what you say or what youdo how you live your life but I willfight and die for your right to haveyour opinion now you can't say thatabout the left today they would rathercriminalize my thinking they wouldrather marginalize my viewpoints so thatthey can gain

hey guys my name is Jeremy if I had topick a political affiliation I guess Iwould say libertarian because Ipersonally don't feel it's anybody'sbusiness what I do as long as I'm nothurting myself or anyone else prettymuch it I think it's funnythere used to be a time in this countrywhere we could actually have politicaldifferences we could have open andhonest discussions about differingopinions without name-calling withoutlosing friends without losing familymembers it's kind of sad that we're atthis point now where just becausesomeone has a difference of opinion thatperson is the devil that person is justthe worst person on the face of theplanetpersonally I think it's a load of crapwe should be able to have differences ofopinions we're different people we comefrom different backgrounds we're doingdifferent things in our liveswe have so many differences and that'swhat makes us all unique none of us arethe same we we're an entire country amelting pot full of just differentreligious political everything I meaneconomic people you'd be hard-pressed tofind many similarities between a groupof 10 people anymore so when we're sodifferent and so unique why should weall fit the same mold politically Idon't I don't think that's right bothparties seem to be dead set on vilifyingthe other which that's fine they've beendoing that for hundreds of years but thedifference is when we are beingmanipulated when our viewpoints arebeing skewed not because of factsbecause keep in mind there's there's alot of stuff out there these days thattry and sway you politically try andsway how you feel in your day to daylife none of its based on factsthe left's whole argument for the pasttwo years has been based on no facts atall it's just this is what we say andpersonally I feel for too long we'vebeen following that mold on both sideswe listen to what we're told peopledon't do research anymore people don'tactually look this up these people bringno evidence nothing to bear other thanwell this is what I say so why should welisten personally I don't think weshould we all may be going differentplaces doing different things with ourlife but then we're all in this boattogether we're gonna succeed or fail asa whole and no amount of blaming orfinger-pointing or anything else isgoing to change that so if we're in thistogether why don't we start trying to dothis together we need to get back to thepoint where we can have a difference ofopinion where we can sit down across thetable from someone that we could not bemore polar opposite from but yet stillrespect that person enough to listen totheir opinion listen and what they haveto say if they bring facts to the tableawesome look at those facts who knowsthey might just change the way you thinkabout something but that's not the waythey want that's not what they want usto do they don't want us talking theydon't want us discussing this they don'twant us to be rational they wanteverything to be an emotional triggerresponse they

it won't helpyou in your day-to-day life what wouldit will do it will help them get electedit will help them get votes it will helpthem please their corporate andpolitical sponsors so they can

so uh see this my walkaway video ormosey away I'm not sure what you wouldcall itI'm smoke you know I'm also gonna drinkso I I always thought differently I wasraised to think definitely one of thefirst things my father ever taught mewas to question authority and can Ireally believe anybody and that's workedmy advantage for most of my life forpretty much all of my life I'm a prettycritical thinker but I was always underthe impression that the Democrats theLiberals were they were on our side theythey wanted free people they wanted aquality that that was that was thenarrative and uh and I believed it formost of my life my teenage years Ibelieved it and I was never political Iconsidered myself an anarchist in highschool you know I was in a punk rockheavy metal you know and I just didn'treally give a [ __ ] because oh right soswearing I'm gonna have to work on thatthat's gonna be a struggle for meso hopefully you'll let that one slide Inever really believed anybody was on ourside I never really believed that eitherparty really cared about you know peoplelike my father my mother my grandparentsyou know it didn't seem never work outthat way no matter who was president Iremember when I was in middle schooland oh god it must have been George BushSenior at the time that uh was nominatedto be President in debt everybody in myage as immature as we were and as an ageuneducated as we were at the time we weall seem to have a unanimous consensusthat there was going to be a World Warthree because a Republican was in officeand there couldn't really be anythingworse for the country than that and Iremember that pretty vividly and I don'tknow why and nobody ever explained it tous but that was just the that was thebelief in the liberal town that I grewup init was very white bread it was middle toupper-middle class you know 99% whitebut it was it was a liberal communitynonetheless which was endearing you knowthey seemed to be open to everybody theyseem to be very accepting to all racesas long as they didn't live there allsexualities as long as they didn't haveto deal with them you know typicalaffluent white suburban America and Ijust I never bought it I you know theyeverybody just seemed to be fully fullof [ __ ] the past forward many many years2014 I was I'm a carpenter I work inconstructionI work in commercial construction and uhObama was up for election and I rememberI was working on Cape Cod buildinghospital and one of the guys in the jobsite from a different trade just made upan announcementor whoever was listening you know canyou believe there's a black guy runningfor president and I remember saying youknow just to offend somebody just to bea jokerI remember saying you know I'll votewhen it's a black woman with huge boobsthat's when I'll vote because that's thechange that this country needs and I wasjoking but I was only half joking Ialways wanted to see drastic change inthis country I always wanted to seesomething that nobody ever thought couldexist that's what I wanted but I at thetime I still I wasn't political I got2014 I think I was 23 I still wasn'tpolitical I didn't really care and andhe was elected and everything was finenothing seemed to change you knownothing really changed at all it was youknow hope and change and all that andyou know i'm i don't know i'm not gonnasay if it's bad about him but nothingseemed to change for me personallynothing seemed to get worse nothingseemed to get betterit was just par for the course which iswhat I expected the politics to be andwhich is what they usually are until the2016 elections when Trump took Americaand beat it like a scrambled egg it wasabsolutely hilarious it was insane Iloved every minute of itI didn't vote for him I votedindependent but it was just amazing thethe true nature that he brought out ofeverybody the true nature that hebrought out of the Democratic Partywhich I had believed were the acceptingparty they were they were the party ofthe people they were the party of theminorities they were the party of thepoor they were the party of everybodyand all of a sudden they becameabsolutely insane they they became ahate group and it kind of blew me awayit was it was like nothing I had everseen before and I've always kind ofliked the bad guy in movies and Trumpimmediately became the bad guy and Ibecame you know uh endeared to that kindof quality that everybody hates this guyso what's he about like I I had to knowso I started doing some homework and itjust it you know the truth is what thetruth is you guys know what it is it'sinsane you know he was wildly admiredthrough his entire life through hisentire career until he decided to getinto politics and all of a sudden he'she's he's the Hitler he's the devil sothe only thing that uh that I reallywanted to share was that the only thingthat I am having a difficult timeconnecting with among the walk awaymovement is that more than not I'mhearing that you're connecting with thisgroup because of your religious beliefsbecause of your conservative beliefs youdon't believe in abortionyou are god-fearing people and that'sall well and goodI'm not I'm an atheist and I believe inabortion I believe everybody should beyou know have the right to choose andI'm with you guysand I I just want people to know thatthere are people that aren't religiousthat there are people that that dobelieve in a in a woman's right tochoose that that are standing with youand I know that's not a conservativevalue I don't have to be you know Idon't have to be what what they say Ihave to be I I can be my own person andI don't know if I would consider myselfpurely Republican but I'm definitelymore conservative than anything else andI just want to thank you guys for doingwhat you're doing andit's it's wonderful and keep it up thankyou[Music]
I've been meaning to do this for areally long time now but I'm finallygetting around to doing it so I wasraised a Christian and I was also raiseda Democrat and my mom kind of instilledin me that it was racist to be aRepublican that Republicans didn't likeblack people and like all of the stuffso I just kind of thought the same thingand I was 11 when Obama got elected andmy mom was like super happy that therewas like a black president that wasgonna be in the White House or whateverand so I thought that that's how it wassupposed to be that like that Democratsare the only people who cared aboutblack people and all that stuff I justwas too young to kind of know thehot-button issues and all that and thenfast-forward a little bit I became anatheist when I was in seventh grade andI just didn't care I was like totallyfor gay marriage totally for abortionhonestly because I didn't know whatabortion was and because when you're inmiddle school like your friends are likecoming out as gay and like you're 12 youdon't know like you think that it's okayyou really don't know and so I kind ofwas on the beginning end of all of thislike gay pansexual transgender stuff umso I just didn't really know what tothink and I only thought what peopletold me but I saw my first abortionprobably when I was 17I was curious as to what it really wasbecause this a girl and I were gettinginto an argument about it and I realizedthat I didn't know really what it wasand she kept saying it's murder it'smurder and I was like it's like it's afetus like why does it matterum so I actually decided to do someresearch look it up and I saw when anabortion was and I ditched like my viewof being pro-choice and I became solelypro-life and then I started to realizeall the things about finances and allthat stuff and how the Republican Partywas really the way to go and then I kindof like came out as a Republican myjunior year of high school after takingAP gov and I was taught and I'm orconcept through a more conservative lensthat's the first time we ever likespoken that way beforeit just made so much more sense to me wewere talking about illegal immigrationon my civics class and I just reallydidn't stand the whole illegalimmigration thing because they arecriminals and they break me in to ourcountry but the Democrats don't want tocall it what it is they just want tocover it up but then they want a murderbaby so I was like okay there'ssomething backward about that I came toknow Christ my freshman year of collegeand then my beliefs just strengthenedeven more since then because like to methe gospel kind of lays out a politicalviewpoint the Bible and the gospel arenot political but if you know the gospelthen you know how to vote becauseeverything you need to know is in theBible right and progressives don't wantyou to read the Bible and they don'twant you to know God they only want youto like rely on the government and thenwhen the government changes everythingthat they implement is just gonna betaken away anyway so I was like no so Imean I'm a very staunch like I'm a superhardcore staunch Republican voting forTrump in 2020 again the Democratstricked me how many brainwashed intothinking that it was not good to votefor Trump but keep in mind I had justbecome a Christian that year and I hadjust dinner in 2017 or 2018 I think itwas 2018 no it was 20 17 2016 1 had justbecome a Republican I just become aChristian and I didn't know like whatTrump was about and I just saw whatpeople were telling me who are like moreliberal Christians so I didn't reallyknow like what to think about Trump butwhen I got to college everybody likewho's black doesn't like me I've almostbeen punched in the face I've beenstalks I've been called an Uncle Tom allbecause I'm like following my whitemasters as I've been told so yeah Ireally don't have any black friendswhich isn't anything new but I thoughtthat since we were on a college campuswe could have more intellectualdiscussions about politics and stuff butit only seems to be getting worse butthat solidified the fact that I knowthat my views are right and I'mI'm gonna do something that God tells meto do and I just don't see God in theDemocratic side so I officially walkedaway when I was a junior in high schoolI am running now as far away from theleft as I can and I encourage everybodyto pick up a book first and foremostpick up the Bible read what it has tosay because all these social justicewarrior hippie loving liberal Christiansdon't know what they're talking aboutand it's really destroying our societybecause they're taking the vulnerablepeople who may just become Christians orthey're talking to the youth and they'retaking the Bible and they're twisting itto fit their agenda and it's reallygross but pick up a Bible and read itfor yourself don't just go by whatsomeone else says start following thenews and you'll see that a lot of it isfake I do follow like primary newsoutlets but I have to be careful aboutwhat I look at because it's fake likeDonald Trump said that we all laughedbut he's right it is fake news um andhonestly just don't be afraid toquestion if someone gets mad at you forquestioning then know that probably whatthey're talking about is not truebecause they can't back it up with anyfactsanytime anybody asks me something I canback it up with a fact in like threeseconds but the left they just can't dothat because they operate on theirfeelings and they don't have a biblicalfoundation and they're going to drivethis country into the ground but God isin control and I know that he has goodplans for the sovereign nation and he'snot going to allow it to become asocialist country where we will belawless and have absolutely no right tono freedom of religion at all so yeahthat's my story if you would like toknow more about my story I have ayoutube channel and my name is SiennaKathryn you just looked that up and lookup the why I walked away YouTube videoand you'll see it there so yeah[Music]

hi so I'm not normally comfortable doingthis kind of thing but I've beeninspired by all of your videos that I'vebeen watching on this walk away campaignFacebook page um my walk away story goeslike thisI was born into a Jewish family and mostJewish families for whatever reason areDemocrats so my parents my grandparentsall my extended family always votedDemocrat not for any other reason thanthe fact that they were Jewish andthat's what they did so my whole life Idid the same as political science majorin college and thought I was educatedbut went to a liberal arts school andwas more indoctrinated than educated Iwas a Democrat well I have to say I didvote for Ross Perot twice I never votedfor Bill Clinton did vote for Obamatwice and during the last election I wasa Bernie supporter I guess I I justdidn't get the whole socialist thing andhow bad that was I was like I said kindof indoctrinated but after I saw whatHillary Clinton and the DNC did toBernie it really started to open my eyesto just how corrupt everything was a newpolitics in general was corrupt but Iguess I didn't realize quite how corruptthe DNC was and I was never going to bea Hillary Clinton supporter never everhave I liked her or her husband and Iguess what really got me was when Bernieturned her on and supported Hillarybecause I just couldn't understand howafter what she had done to himhis supporters and his campaign whywould he turn around and offer hissupport to her I never was a trumpsupporter but after that I guess Ireally just started doing my homeworkthat I should have done years before andit really did actually educate myselfand I finally realized how theDemocratic Party has done nothing forthe last 40 years for anybody besidestry to tear people apart create divisionthe whole identity politics andpolitical correctness thing is out ofcontrol and I really finally made theconnection that they really are a partyof Communists and Marxists who want totake away our freedoms and have nointention of creating unity in thiscountry so he had a pretty abruptwake-up calland since I have been really payingattention to what's been going onI actually am fully behind PresidentTrump at this point I think he's finallysomeone who's doing something for theAmerican people whereas I don't thinkany president in the last 40 yearsreally had that intention so register isan independent I didn't even vote in thelast election because I like I said Iwasn't a trump supporter and I certainlywasn't gonna vote for Hillary now I wishI had voted for Trump and I will besupporting him in 2020 but I'm veryexcited about this campaign it's greatto see so many people especially youngpeople waking up to the reality that ittook me years to do I wish I had beenthat insightful at 17 or 18 years oldlike some of theyoung people are one of the great thingsI think about this campaign in additionto waking people up is it's really justbringing people of all walks of lifetogether and it's making us realize thatwe're not that different we all want thesame things we want to be free we wantto be happy we want you know to raiseour families and have our friends andhave our careers and be freeI do wish but I do think also that oneof the things that all of this identitypolitics has done is it's really I thinkit's created a lot of loneliness in theworld I think it's made everybody feelnot only disconnected but like we can'tvoice our opinions I've been attackedfor my views since they've changedbecause I was friends with a lot ofliberal people and they don't want tohear anything I have to say anymoreI've been called all kinds of names I'velost friends I've been called crazynumerous times I do wish there was a waythat like-minded people could find eachother and actually meet in personbecause as great as social media is Ithink that what's really lacking in thisworld these days is real humanconnection so that's something that Ikind of wish could come out of this alsohi so I'm not normally comfortable doingthis kind of thing but I've beeninspired by all of your videos that I'vebeen watching on this walk away campaignFacebook page um my walk away story goeslike thisI was born into a Jewish family and mostJewish families for whatever reason areDemocrats so my parents my grandparentsall my extended family always votedDemocrat not for any other reason thanthe fact that they were Jewish andthat's what they did so my whole life Idid the same as political science majorin college and thought I was educatedbut went to a liberal arts school andwas more indoctrinated than educated Iwas a Democrat well I have to say I didvote for Ross Perot twice I never votedfor Bill Clinton did vote for Obamatwice and during the last election I wasa Bernie supporter I guess I I justdidn't get the whole socialist thing andhow bad that was I was like I said kindof indoctrinated but after I saw whatHillary Clinton and the DNC did toBernie it really started to open my eyesto just how corrupt everything was a newpolitics in general was corrupt but Iguess I didn't realize quite how corruptthe DNC was and I was never going to bea Hillary Clinton supporter never everhave I liked her or her husband and Iguess what really got me was when Bernieturned her on and supported Hillarybecause I just couldn't understand howafter what she had done to himhis supporters and his campaign whywould he turn around and offer hissupport to her I never was a trumpsupporter but after that I guess Ireally just started doing my homeworkthat I should have done years before andit really did actually educate myselfand I finally realized how theDemocratic Party has done nothing forthe last 40 years for anybody besidestry to tear people apart create divisionthe whole identity politics andpolitical correctness thing is out ofcontrol and I really finally made theconnection that they really are a partyof Communists and Marxists who want totake away our freedoms and have nointention of creating unity in thiscountry so he had a pretty abruptwake-up calland since I have been really payingattention to what's been going onI actually am fully behind PresidentTrump at this point I think

hello everyone this is Jose and this ismy walkaway video about a month ago Ishared my written statement on thewalkaway Facebook group and I waswelcomed by open arms with everyone so Iwould like to do a follow-up video Iwould like to thank Brandon strata ifyou are watching this thank you forbeing the founder of the walk awaycampaign I came across your campaignabout a year ago if I had not comeacross your campaign I still would havebeen deceived by the Democrat Party andthe lies of the mainstream media I amNOT a Russian but and I agree witheverything this campaign stands forracism is wrong however I agree withBrandon that hostility towards whitepeople is not the answer to for endingracism labeling them them that they'reout to get people like me people ofcolor sexism and discrimination andviolence towards women is wrong buthostility towards men like myself againis not the answerfurthermore discrimination towards theLGBT community is wrong and againhostility towards straight heterosexualslike myself is not the answer andreligious discrimination towards Muslimsis also wrong but you cannot persecuteChristiansit cannot be so double standard that isjust wrong so a little about me I wasborn here in the United StatesI'm Latino I'm iguana Malin andSalvadorian descentI consider myself American first myfamily came here legallymy father was conservative and my motherwas conservative but on some thingsshe was liberal even though I hadconservative parents I was taught inschools that the Democrat Party andliberals were for people of color andpoor people and the Republican Party wasfor rich white people and that they donot care about people like myself so Ibelieve that for many years of my lifeand that because I'm Hispanic that I'mdestined to be a victim so there was apoint in my life where I wanted tobecome a police officer however in myyears at when I received my bachelor'sdegree I was discouraged by my academicadviser to not become a police officerwhy because they apparently they like toracially profile Latinos and blackAmericans and that's what I'm going tobe trained to do so I believed it and Ino longer became a police officer eventhough I've always been a supporter ofthe police I've always been a defenderof the police and supporter of ourservicemen and women I've always hadrespect and I still do to this day mayGod bless you I my passion has alwaysbeen in teaching so in a way I'm gladthat I didn't become a police officer nomore because nowadays it's hard with allthe hostility towards them it's hard tobe a police officerin addition I did during the Illinoisprimary I'm from Illinois I'm fromChicago I voted for Bernie Sanders I didnot know any better at the time becauseI was deceived by the mainstream mediaand by the lies of the Democratic Partyso I voted for Hillary Clinton in the2016 election even though I did not likeher I thought I had no other choice andbecause I did believe the lies of themainstream media in regards to presidentTrump and his supporters I did believethat they were all out to get me and Ihear and after listening to ben shapirojordan peterson in malawi innopolis theamazing lucas and many of these freethinkers libertarians and conservativesI've discovered that I was always aconservative but I just did not know itit's like I forgot so for the nextelection I will be voting for PresidentTrump and after doing my research Irealized that the media was lying andafter coming across the walk of waycampaign I noticed the diversity invoters there is members of the blackcommunity who support president Trumpthere are Latinos like myself whosupport president Truong there's membersof the LGBTQ community who also supportpresident Truong it's not only whiteAmericans it's a big diversity ofAmericans and legal immigrants so I'mfor the first amendment for freedom ofspeech which they're trying to abolishI'm for the second of menthe right to bear arms I'm pro-life I'malso a Christian I'm a believer in Godand in the Bible and I'm not ashamedabout it and let me be clear like manyof us in the walk away campaign I am NOTa Russian bot and so it and nobody elseis all this labeling is just a way forthe media to to make people think thatwe're crazy we most certainly are notand I'm for the wall because that'sgonna reduce the illegal immigrationcrisis yes I have Latino parents butlike I said I believe immigration shouldbe done legally if you want to come tothis country come legally we are notsaying don't come come here legally moreimportantly when I went to Wisconsin tovisit the family that I have there and Imet some of my cousin's friends who wereTrump supporters that's when I began torealize that they are not how the mediaportrays them they were some of the mosthonest and sincere people who I have whoI met and when I sat down and got toknow them I did agree with the reasonswhy they voted for president from andmost of their reason was because of theillegal immigration and the fact that hewas going to create more jobs which hehas because unemployment rate forHispanics and blacks is at its lowestbut the mainstream media will not tellyou that they will certainly not tellyou that them the Democratic Party wasfor slavery and the Republican Party wasagainst it slavery and racism and againThank You Brandon for starting this walkaway campaignthank you for the followers of thewalkaway campaign and for sharing allyour testimonies because you inspire meto come out and speak out so I'm notgonna apologize for being a man I'm notgonna apologize for being pro-life I'mnot gonna apologize for being aborn-again Christian and I am NOT gonnaapologize for walking away from theDemocratic Party so I'll encourage youdo some research on the history of theRepublican Party and the history of theDemocratic Party and pay attention towhat President Trump actually said notwhat the mainstream media is telling youI did live in Canada for many years andit is a completely different world butsimilarlyover there most people are liberal andyou do not vote conservative that's abig no-no it was always my dream to comeback to the United States and I'm glad Idid I'm thankful to God that I was bornin the greatest country in the world andI'm thankful for the walkaway campaignand for President Trump may God blesshim all right that's all for now I willbe looking forward to the next electionI will be voting for a president Trumpall right peace out[Music]

hello and welcome to my new channelblack is in red so for those of you whodon't know me I'm gonna take some timeto introduce myselfmy name is Rebecca and for the last Iwould say five years I have been on ajourney my journey has been that of anafrican-american woman going from leftto right and also what caused me toleave the Democratic plantation and whydo I feel the need to speak out now andwhy do I feel the need to inform thosearound this country and around the worldthat yes indeed black is the new redthat we are becoming a part of the redrevolution which is the Republican Partynow why would we do such a thing becausewe're tired we're tired of being lied towe're retired of having our ideas andour thoughts ignored by our leaders ourpolitical leaders and the thoughtleaders in this nation who take ourvotes for granted and we're tired ofbeing the oppressed mentally we're tiredof having our thoughts and our actionsand our speech being monitored beingpersecuted because we want to leave theDemocratic plantation well I'll tell youwhat there's a lot of us who will speakout and who won't be intimidated and whowon't just buckle down and say hey I'mnot gonna say anything because it mayoffend someone well I'm sorry if myideas and my thoughts offend you but I'mgonna speak anyway I'm gonna be thevoice for African American women and menwho don't have a voice who feel likethey can't speak so with that being saidI'm going to talk about what led me tothe Republican Party and actuallyquote-unquote walk away I want to justapply to walk away I would just want totake a moment to just apply the walkaway movement because it takes a lot ofcourage to walk away from everythingthat you know walk away from friendswalk away from family walk away from afake ideology so I just want to take thetime right now to say wow you are a herofor walking away and I also want to takethe time right now to just appreciatethe young black leaders who met with thepresident the president opened up thedoors of the White Houseand we had we saw recently were youngblack african-american men and womenfrom around this country took theopportunity to go and speak to thepresident and for him to speak to him tothem to hear their thoughts and to hearhis thoughts and have a dialogue andthat has never happened before in thehistory of this nation and so I thinkthe the got leaders who did thatCandace Owens for being brave andCharlie Kirk for being brave and Kanyefor being brave but guess what there aremillions of us out there who need totake their lead and learn from it and bebrave I'm not only doing this for meI'm doing this for my children mychildren I have an adult 22 year-olddaughter who was one of the first peopleto say you know what you need to giveDonald Trump a chance you need to listento him I said why would I listen toDonald Trump and she told me this wasback in the fall of 2016 she said to memom you need to listen to Donald Trumpbecause he raised his children correctlythey don't drink and they don't smokeand anyone that can raise kids correctlyif someone you need to listen to and Ibegan to reflect back on my father whoabsolutely adored Donald Trump my dadpassed away in 2014 but years prior tothat he told me exactly who Donald Trumpwas and what he meant to him you see mydad was a real estate investor he was abusinessman but he admired Donald Trumpbecause in the 1940s my dad was also acaddy when he was a young child in SouthFlorida and golf courses that were inSouth Florida area and he told me thatDonald Trump years later fought todesegregate the country clubs in theSouth Florida area or in the whole stateand so my dad admired him for that andhe also admired him for his work ethicand his business savvy and so when inthe when Donald Trump decided to run andall the news media just turned on himbecause when he was running againstother Republicans he was wonderful butas soon as he decided to run andactually win the nomination and actuallyrun against the demonic darling childHillary Clintonthen he became the devil not really seewe've been deceived we've beencompletely deceived by the Democraticplantation owners and I say for one nomore so my channel is gonna be dedicatedto facts it's gonna be dedicated toreason it's gonna be dedicated to studythis is gonna be dedicated to researchit's gonna be dedicated to free and openfire you see we are living in a societynow where your thoughts are basicallyunder fire there's a war for yourthoughts and we're also living in asociety where you can't you're notallowed to think for yourself so ourminds are being chained to a certain wayof thinking and particularly theafrican-american community why do we allhave to think the same way why do we allhave to vote the same way why we allhave to believe the same politicalideologies who told us we have tobelieve that everything the Democraticplantation owners tell us we have tojust tow the line what does it mean totow something if you tow something meansyou put it on your back and you drag itto safety when it's broken down wellguess what Democratic plantation ownershave never told anything for us theywe've been our communities have beenbroken down for decades have they putour communities on their back and toldus the safety absolutely notbut they do have what's called mentalpolicing of your thoughts and theirpolice their thought police keep you inline if you darest open up your mouth onfacebook or any type of social media andyou begin to speak exactly what's inyour heart the thought police willattack you and beat you verbally backinto line just as the former slaveoverseers that if the slaves began toget out of line they would get beat backinto line so they can do exactly whateveryone else was doing in the field andthat's the job of mental slave ownersto keep you in mind and have theoverseers to do things to do the dirtywork how dare you try to leave how dareyou try to have your own thoughts wellguess what no more I applied and I wantto be a part of the solution I want tohelpI want to be a part of Black Sea I wantto be a part of make America great againI want to be a part of itand I'm gonna take this assignment veryseriously because there's so many in oursociety who don't have enough they feellike they can't speak up but they maynot have enough courage to do it so I'mgonna do it but today keep the videosemi short as a lunch I'm going to talka little bit about my experiences andwhat led me to change what might need toabandon the Democratic mindset or theDemocrat mindset and think for myselfI'm a person who grew up in a two-familyhome mom and dad got married staymarried until my dad's passing into 2014I grew up with what you would callprivileged in a sense I went to privateschools and I really never had to wantfor anything and I really didn'tquote-unquote see racism until I becamean adult and went out into the world andbegan to work and I begin to see racismand that it's really something thatexists well way back then I decided itI'm not gonna be unsuccessful because ofracism I'm going to be successful inspite of it so I worked hard and didwhat I was supposed to do went tocollege I went to that predominantlyhistorically black institution of higherlearning populated University Igraduated and I went into the businesssector and got a job and did everythingthat you would quote-unquote do gotmarried had kids but I was still youknow politically very just veryuninformed and very uninvolved in thepolitical process it was just somethingthat other people did but it wasn'tanything that I thought about on aday-to-day basis it wasn't until of 2004that my eyes are gonna open up when acasual acquaintances that I had haven'thad her from what we thought at the timemaybe her tenth or twelfth abortion andI began to figure what is an abortion Ijust begin to think about it like I knewwas a termination but I didn'tunderstand the gravity of what it wasand I began to research it when I foundout who Margaret Sanger was and whoPlanned Parenthood who they really wereand what their agenda was and that 800big african-american babies alone die inthis country last year 330 thousandAfrican American babies were aborted inthis nation and that since 1973 70million babies have been aborted and howthat disproportionately affects theafrican-american community I said tomyself there's something drasticallywrong people just don't know people haveno idea and so I began to graduallyleave the liberal fight that I had waspro-choice I quickly switched topro-life and my views my conservativeviews began to become birth then fastforward 2015 2016I heard that Donald Trump was running Ithought he was a joke I said there's noway in the world I don't Trump's evergonna win and I'm beginning to followthe campaign and I watched him mow downevery Republican candidate that he ranagainst and I said wow that's somethingthat is certainly surprising and as theyear 2016 kept moving on I started totake him more and more seriously untilone day he came to my city I was livingin Orlando at the time Orlando Floridaat the time and I was in the library andI was studying for an exam and I happento go on my phone and it there was amessage there Donald Trump is gonna bein Orlandomore specifically Sanford Florida whichwas like 30 minutes outside of Orlandoand I said you know what I'm goingbecause I want to be able to see formyself who he was andI called my sister and I said hey if Idisappear into thin air it's because Iwent to a trump rally in Sanford Floridaif you know anything about SanfordFlorida Sanford Florida is where TrayvonMartin was killed so needless to say Iwas very nervous because I thought thatall Trump supporters were racist andwe're going to be flying the dixie flagson their big monster trucks and and allkinds of things Confederate and that'swhat I was expecting as I was driving Ikept asking myself what are you doingare you nice why are you going to atrump rally you know this is gonna be inheaven but racist white supremists thereand you're black and you're by yourselfso I went anyway I kept driving and Idrove and I drove and as I got closer tothe venue traffic was insane I mean itwas bumper-to-bumper for miles and Isaid why it isn't the news showing thisI said this is something I wasn'texpecting so many people and so finallywhen I got there I had to park a mileawayand I'm like there are so many peoplehere and when I got out of my car and Imet a man he was a gorgeous-lookingClarke Caucasian man and he walked up tome and he said hey nice car and we juststruck back on a conversation as we werewalking and he said what brings you to atrump rally and I said well I'm acurious person by nature and then Istarted talking to him about howdisappointed I was in the DemocraticParty and how I was so unfulfilled andhow I was searching for something I wassearching for truth and I wanted to knowwho Donald Trump was for real I didn'twant the media telling me who he was Iwanted to know for myself and so I keptwalking and this asian guy startswalking with us and I turn to the two ofthem and we were all talking about theForgotten men and women of America and Isaid to both of them I said you knowwhat CNN will never show this CNN willnever show how there's anafrican-american woman a Caucasian manand a agen man walking to a Trump rallythat's like a joke right so they bothlaughed and we walked and when Iout there I discovered something soamazing I walked in and I saw thousandsof people of every walk from every walkof life I saw a woman for a child I sawa gauge for a chump I saw blacks forTrump I saw Hispanic for Trump science Isaw you know just everybody andeverybody was laughing and talking andjoking and and you can feel the Americanenergy and I looked around and I waslike wow this is what America is this iswhat America should be everybody comingtogether everybody loving one anotherand just people we didn't know eachother but just the fact that we were allthere together it just was amazing andso finally Donald Trump got there and hebegan to speak and of course he did thewhole fake news and everything he didn'thold this spiel but after a few minuteshe'd be gonna talk about what makesAmerica great he began to talk about whyhe wanted to make America great he beganto talk about the things that meantsomething to me like unleashing all ofthe gifts and all of the enormous talentthat we have in this nation and he saidif you give me a chance to be yourpresident that's exactly what I'm gonnado I'm gonna unleash the power of theAmerican spirit and I just felt like Ihad gone to the best pep rally in theworld I mean as I walked away I was likewow yes I can and I remember that fromthe Barack Obama campaign but you knowwhat no he didn't he didn't do anythingfor us and so I'm like yeah wow I couldactually I could start my own business Ican go back to school what I could justdo these things and I remember listeningand hearing his voice the president orthat at that point he was just you knowthe candidate and I remember him hearinghis voice and I'm walking and literallyback a mile and something changed Iwalked away with two things two thingsthat I knew for surenumber one Hillary Clinton was nevergoing to beat him because of the massiveamount of the people that were there andnumber two he had my vote because Ineeded to vote for someone who at leastpromised to do some things that I wanteddone in Washington DCand from that day on I was able to talkto my siblings and they changed theirminds about Donald Trump we have visitedWashington we have prayed for thepresident we've gone different placesNew York and we prayed but for most forthe most part this channel is dedicatedto others who want change who want toleave the Democratic Party and who wantto be a part of what's happening nowthere is the walkaway campaign there isflex it there is so many otherorganizations that are welcoming exDemocrats and people who

people did but it wasn'tanything that I thought about on aday-to-day basis it wasn't until of 2004that my eyes are gonna open up when acasual acquaintances that I had haven'thad her from what we thought at the timemaybe her tenth or twelfth abortion andI began to figure what is an abortion Ijust begin to think about it like I knewwas a termination but I didn'tunderstand the gravity of what it wasand I began to research it when I foundout who Margaret Sanger was and whoPlanned Parenthood who they really wereand what their agenda was and that 800big african-american babies alone die inthis country last year 330 thousandAfrican American babies were aborted inthis nation and that since 1973 70million babies have been aborted and howthat disproportionately affects theafrican-american community I said tomyself there's something drasticallywrong people just don't know people haveno idea and so I began to graduallyleave the liberal fight that I had waspro-choice I quickly switched topro-life and my views my conservativeviews began to become birth then fastforward 2015 2016I heard that Donald Trump was running Ithought he was a joke I said there's noway in the world I don't Trump's evergonna win and I'm beginning to followthe campaign and I watched him mow downevery Republican candidate that he ranagainst and I said wow that's somethingthat is certainly surprising and as theyear 2016 kept moving on I started totake him more and more seriously untilone day he came to my city I was livingin Orlando at the time Orlando Floridaat the time and I was in the library andI was studying for an exam and I happento go on my phone and it there was amessage there Donald Trump is gonna bein Orlandomore specifically Sanford Florida whichwas like 30 minutes outside of Orlandoand I said you know what I'm goingbecause I want to be able to see formyself who he was andI called my sister and I said hey if Idisappear into thin air it's because Iwent to a trump rally in Sanford Floridaif you know anything about SanfordFlorida Sanford Florida is where TrayvonMartin was killed so needless to say Iwas very nervous because I thought thatall Trump supporters were racist andwe're going to be flying the dixie flagson their big monster trucks and and allkinds of things Confederate and that'swhat I was expecting as I was driving Ikept asking myself what are you doingare you nice why are you going to atrump rally you know this is gonna be inheaven but racist white supremists thereand you're black and you're by yourselfso I went anyway I kept driving and Idrove and I drove and as I got closer tothe venue traffic was insane I mean itwas bumper-to-bumper for miles and Isaid why it isn't the news showing thisI said this is something I wasn'texpecting so many people and so finallywhen I got there I had to park a mileawayand I'm like there are so many peoplehere and when I got out of my car and Imet a man he was a gorgeous-lookingClarke Caucasian man and he walked up tome and he said hey nice car and we juststruck back on a conversation as we werewalking and he said what brings you to atrump rally and I said well I'm acurious person by nature and then Istarted talking to him about howdisappointed I was in the DemocraticParty and how I was so unfulfilled andhow I was searching for something I wassearching for truth and I wanted to knowwho Donald Trump was for real I didn'twant the media telling me who he was Iwanted to know for myself and so I keptwalking and this asian guy startswalking with us and I turn to the two ofthem and we were all talking about theForgotten men and women of America and Isaid to both of them I said you knowwhat CNN will never show this CNN willnever show how there's anafrican-american woman a Caucasian manand a agen man walking to a Trump rallythat's like a joke right so they bothlaughed and we walked and when Iout there I discovered something soamazing I walked in and I saw thousandsof people of every walk from every walkof life I saw a woman for a child I sawa gauge for a chump I saw blacks forTrump I saw Hispanic for Trump science Isaw you know just everybody andeverybody was laughing and talking andjoking and and you can feel the Americanenergy and I looked around and I waslike wow this is what America is this iswhat America should be everybody comingtogether everybody loving one anotherand just people we didn't know eachother but just the fact that we were allthere together it just was amazing andso finally Donald Trump got there and hebegan to speak and of course he did thewhole fake news and everything he didn'thold this spiel but after a few minuteshe'd be gonna talk about what makesAmerica great he began to talk about whyhe wanted to make America great he beganto talk about the things that meantsomething to me like unleashing all ofthe gifts and all of the enormous talentthat we have in this nation and he saidif you give me a chance to be yourpresident that's exactly what I'm gonnado I'm gonna unleash the power of theAmerican spirit and I just felt like Ihad gone to the best pep rally in theworld I mean as I walked away I was likewow yes I can and I remember that fromthe Barack Obama campaign but you knowwhat no he didn't he didn't do anythingfor us and so I'm like yeah wow I couldactually I could start my own business Ican go back to school what I could justdo these things and I remember listeningand hearing his voice the president orthat at that point he was just you knowthe candidate and I remember him hearinghis voice and I'm walking and literallyback a mile and something changed Iwalked away with two things two thingsthat I knew for surenumber one Hillary Clinton was nevergoing to beat him because of the massiveamount of the people that were there andnumber two he had my vote because Ineeded to vote for someone who at leastpromised to do some things that I wanteddone in Washington DCand from that day on I was able to talkto my siblings and they changed theirminds about Donald Trump we have visitedWashington we have prayed for thepresident we've gone different placesNew York and we prayed but for most forthe most part this channel is dedicatedto others who want change who want toleave the Democratic Party and who wantto be a part of what's happening nowthere is the walkaway campaign there isflex it there is so many

didn't have any guns wedidn't really talk too much politicsexcept that you know it felt good likethat you felt like you're on the rightside of history if you're a democratpretty muchand the left kind of does have amonopoly on comedyand things funny because the right in myopinioni don't know maybe people just see themas uh stiff or something like thatso all throughout high school allthroughout middle school never reallythought too much about it but when ientered college i went to communitycollegesome reason i started getting moreanti-american beliefs i don't know if itwas seated in therein the education somehow but somehowsomewayi started thinking that the us was badpeople would say yeah but what about thethe fact that we bombed these people andthat people was like oh yeah you'reright you knowthe us does suck and then i think 20122014 whatever it was they did occupywall street so i decided to go downthere i was a nursing student at thetimei thought i was doing good you know likeoh yeah [ __ ] the man[ __ ] capitalism whatever umso i graduated nursing school i startedworking as an er nurseand uh did some travel nursing and wentto californiaand i met some interesting people outthere had fun and i decidedi would take a vacation i went to i wentto thailanduh for four months of my life and whilei was therei got to live under a differentgovernment governmental systemum uh on on paper thailand is aconstitutional monarchywhich means they are ruled bythe queen or the king so maybe aconstitutionalpatriarchy whatever you want or monarchywhich is just aroyal family rulethe king died when i was there and for amonththere was mandatedlimits on social gatheringsand mandated limits on what you couldwearif you were living in bangkok which idid for two weeks and you were caughtwithout a shirtlike if i went for a run around downtownbangkokand they saw me without a shirt a copwould chase me he'd be like heyyou need to go back and put your [ __ ]shirt onthere is mass gatherings in the palacesquareum where pretty much it was like thestate is your familyand they gave out food and there werethese giant vatsof a black ink and a mortar of saltand people were required to bring theirclothing there and diet blackin respect to the king that had passedso this was an eye-opening experienceand when i was there in 2016donald trump was elected president and icouldn't believe it i was like nono way this is terrible but i reallydidn't know why it was terribleand my australian buddy was like oi matetrump's going to be your [ __ ]presidenttrump's going to be your [ __ ] yeahtrump's your president did you guys knowyou have the biggest [ __ ] militaryand i was like what he's like yeah yougotta go like 18 destroyers they snapthatbit like whatever man donald trump'sterrible just because i've been fed itcame back started working again dadpassed awayyou know and i started taking care of mygrandmastarted just taking on moreresponsibility asa as an adult and i was working at thelocal trauma centerwhen i met a couple people that i workedwith some ex-militaryand some trump supporters and inside iwas thinkingthese guys they're they're just funnypeople mangood people funny and yeah theysupported trump even though i thought oh[ __ ] trumpi was like maybe these guys aren't thatbad they're funny we joke around with[ __ ] some of them are ex-militarysome are great charge nurses you knowthey're able to take a joke we can sitand [ __ ] they're nothateful people and that kind of openedmyeyes up and then um a friend of my dad'sso we started hanging out more good guyand he took me shooting for the firsttime about a year agoand when i went shooting i was scared iwas like oh my god i got i never shotagain the only kid in my neighborhoodwas a friendhis family had guns and i was like thisis crazy guns everywhere it just didn'tmake sense to meshot a little bit and this past februarywhen [ __ ] start going downi am i bought it i bought a gunuh i took to the range into indoor rangea couple timesand then i started i took a coupletacticaloutdoor classes and that made me feelmore comfortable with weapons so istarted researching laws and what thiswaswhat a semi-auto was what uman assault weapon was and i realizedthat the left has some very draconianscary very bad gun lawsum because as a jewish mannot to identify myself in some type ofcategorybut as a jew we haveour people have a precedent for whathappens when your guns get taken awaywhat happens is this we start limitingyourlittle gun rights that you have and thenweon basis that it's for community safetyand after that we're going to startconfiscating them no more buy backprograms no more bring them in we'recoming to your [ __ ] house and we'retaking your gunsand shortly thereafter after this powerdifferential was createdthey started rounding us jews up puttingus in camps and exterminating usand there's historical precedent forprecedent for this in the ussrin cuba in many socialistcountries um but this is more recentlythat i started kind of looking into thisand thinking about thisbut you know jewish people we need torecognizethat there is a precedent for guncontrol being badand this is what's kind of moved me veryfar away from the leftand uh in the democratic party umafter i posted on facebook that i wasvoting for trump i received over 800[ __ ] commentson my on my facebook post condescendingvitriolic rude hateful i engaged withthem until i was blue in the faceand i started becoming hateful myselfand started justyou know just insulting people becausethey were just so [ __ ] meanabout about me voting for somebody thati wanted to vote foryou know it i just i became so tired andi realized that the left ismore vitriolic more hateful than theythen they think that donald trump is hispoliciesare great his policies are amazing idisagree with some of his stuffi don't like his handling ofquantitative easing the fed federalmonetary policybut for the majority the most part ilike his stuffthat's pretty much my story walking awayumyou know we need our gun rights we needfreedom of speechi like comedy i like talking [ __ ] youcan't talk [ __ ] you can't say what youwantyou know i meanwhere's your freedom where is it anywaythat's my rant for the day have a goodday everybody bye
today what I'm gonna do is I'm gonnashare my testimony of how I walked awayI hope that this will help someone andencourage others to do the same thetitle of this is I did it without eventhinking about it but woke up to thetruth when I grew up I was told byeveryone around me that I was to be aproud Democrat I was coached from birththat the Democratic Party was the onlyparty that provided for and did anythingfor blacks we were taught thatRepublicans were evil day after day weekafter week month after month and yearafter year this was pounded into my headby friends and family I was even toldthat when I became eligible to vote thatI had better vote Democratic or not comehome every four years we had to sit downin front of the TV and watch theDemocratic Party convention all of itwe were not allowed to ask questions orrefute anything about the party or hisplatform even though we were never toldwhat the platform was I had questionsand I needed answers I began to speak upat an early age and question why blackswere so loyal to a party that violatedeverything that we were taught morallyand in church it just didn't make senseto me my mother taught us conservativevalues and sound biblical doctrine as achild I was taken to church almost everyday of the week and it wasn't anhour-long service either the preachersalways told me that you should nevergive people too much knowledge or theywould no longer be needed they said thatit it was necessary to keep people indarkness so that they would always belooked up to and have a job we would sitthere for hours upon hours as we heardthe Word of God and politics preach tous in a very biased wayit didn't make sense however because itwas like driving a square peg into around hole as you can imagine I got intoa whole lot of trouble questioningauthority to make a long story short Iended up with a very sore behind and alot of hurt feelings I personally knowthe meaning of the cliche a hard headmakes for a soft behind I was a target averbal discipline at home and at churchI was called a heretic and was told tokeep quiet many of the leaders told methat I had the letter but no spirit Ieventually had to leave home and thatcongregation I enlisted in the militarythings were not any better there as theblacks that I encountered with the sameblind followers of the Democrat Party wesat down for hours discussing why

hey everyone I'm Jeremy I'm the artistbehind the YouTube channel that you'recurrently watching so I'm addingsomething to the ongoing list of videosbeing made about walk away and it wasn'tmy intention to have anything to add toit because I'm not walking away fromanything in particular not that I haveany issues that don't have the bigblaring questions but I got a phone callfrom a friend of mine a couple hours agohe's trying to State at the moment andwe've been friends since high school andwe share a lot of the same friends sowhen he shared with me the conversationsthat he's been having over the last fewweeks it made me think this soundsexactly like every video I've seen wherepeople describing the reasons whythey're walking away and yes I'mfamiliar with the fact that there aresome fake accounts on Twitter none ofthat changes the fact that my friendcalled me about real things so that'swhat we're discussing the reason Ithought about making the video was wehad a conversation that I thought maybesome of you might benefit from hearingand I'm willing to put myself out thereto say it so generalities number partone I'm a conservative my friends aliberal he was always fairly liberal andI have always been a contrarian askanybody that knows me regardless of thetopic on the table I'm probably takingthe opposite of everyone else it's justhow I am I have been an illustratorsince before high school and one of myclients was a cause for like back andforth between me and my friend over theyears all good friendly stuff andrecently that client made a comment gothim my friend thinking again and justlike out of the many videos you've seenabout people describing the reasons whythey're walking awayhe began to have his own challenges andstruggles to try to reconcile what wasin his mind how we perceive things howhe perceived himself why did he thinkthe things that he thought why did hesee things the waste anyway and so as hebegan to share these with his bestfriends of decades to his surprise theystarted suggested maybe she was a Nazisecretly a Nazi maybe he was bigoted andjust couldn't you know white privilegethis went through the whole thing and myfriend is fairly progressive and he'scalled me to the carpet many times whenI've been misinformed and posted somebig rant but he genuinely tells me I wassurprised because this dynamic wereliberals sharing what they feel or whatthey're discovering is not supposed toactually really create a problem that'ssome right-wing or alright Nazi thingthat's been fabricated so he ran intothat face first and asked me what do wedo and so that's part two is why he hadthis awakening this is I'll try to bequick I've been a political cartoonistworked with a lot of musicians andcelebrities over the years I feel veryblessed in my career one of my clientsand I'm still proud to say I don't carewhat society has to say about it one ofmy clients and I consider a friend isMilo Annapolis you might have heard ofhim he's a British guy I think he'sgonna be big I began working with him in2016 as Milo said two crates andmischeif the peat one of the pieces Idid for him that really bugged my friendthe whole catalysts behind the call andin this video in 2016 in March I did thethe infamous illustration of Pepe theFrog and the GOP elephant like ghost ofChristmas future for the article ran onBreitbart called the Conservatives guideto the alt-right which then became ifyou'reyou know and so my friend always had abeef with that so some other things inthe news came up and my friend startedto go through that process then he tellsme about what our friends have beencalling in and suggesting about hischaracterso then part three he asks me what do Idowhat's it what's a conservative tell mewhat I don't know how do I become aconservative an hour what am I supposedto become and that was when it dawned onme that politics is not the answer thephilosophies beliefs that's a littlelook I could care less what you becomepolitically philosophically I don't carewho you vote for any more than I hopeyou care who I vote for so what I reallycare about though is you take thisopportunity just not to go find a

so I've been watching a lot of thesewalkaway videos that a couple days and Ithought maybe I should add my own voiceand my own story to this let's go back10 years in 2008 Bush was on his way outas president I hated bush the reason Ihated bush was because I've worked witha bunch of like blue-collar factory tugswho told me that I should hate bushbecause bush was keeping the workingclass down I played in punk bands all myfavorite punk bands told me I had tohate Bush because he was just the mostevil Republican ever Bad Religion noeffects all those tough bands so I hatedbush I was reading books by Howard kennoam chomsky reading the crime thinkbooks I was very hard like this I was soafraid that a religious Rite was goingto take over like a Nazi regime just soafraid of this religious right thing soanyhow I was basically auntie funtraining one morning this guy I workedwith came up to me and we're talking andhe said you know if these Republicansare gonna keep calling us communists weneed to call them what they are they'refascist because Mussolini said thatfascism is capitalism now me I like tolook things up so I get off work I goand I check it out on the internet I'mlooking this up I couldn't find this Icouldn't find any more where Mussoliniat said anything remotely close to thiswhat I found was the exact opposite Ifound that Mussolini was a huge studentof Karl Marxhe loved the Communist Manifestohe actually Mussolini actually spentmore money than Italy had on socialprograms and that the word fascist camefrom this word feces which was a bundleof sticks and that was miscellaneousgoal for Italy was for it to be likethis bundle of sticks that cannot bebrokenit was collectivism and it was communismso I learned that Mussolini was acommunist and fascism was a form ofcommunism so then I get to looking intothe economics of the Nazi Party and it'sgot the word socialist in the name solet's see how socialist they areI stumbled upon the nineties 25-pointprogram now in the 25-point programpoints 13 14 16 17 and 18 all had to dowith redistribution of wealth and seasonthe means of production by thegovernment point 15 had to do withSocial Welfare point 20 had to do withsocialized education and there wasnothing about universal health care inthere but that's because the not ourGermany had already implementedsocialized health care in 1880 but theNazis didn't bother trying to do awaywith it they actually took advantage ofthe government's control over healthcare to put to do their euthanasiaprograms and several things like thatalso found out that in Nazi Germany thetop four percent were taxed 50 percentof their earnings and I also found outthat Hitler several Thomson speechestalked about real socialism and whatreal socialism wasn't that over there inRussia they weren't doing real socialismso this kind of resonated with mebecause with all the same things I wassaying these were the kinds of policiesthat as this left-wing factory workerpunk-rockerI was telling people and I was tellingpeople constantly you know realsocialism and have been tried and thatthat was the same thing Hitler wassaying and it was just he was wrong so Ibacked away I backed away from all thatand I started telling people I don'twant to talk about politics I just don'twant any part of this discussion and ifpeople would talk to politics about meI'd say well you know the Democrats andthis and then I bring up the thepolicies of Nazi Germany and then I gotwhat I wanted I got left alone none ofthe punk rockers wanted to talk to menobody I worked with wanted to talk tome because I was all of a sudden talkingbad about the Democrats you know itwasn't that I wouldn't talk bad aboutRepublicans I talked bad about them tooI hated them too still but the fact thatI started talking bad about Democratsand that's the thing about punk rockthey all claim to be anarchist butthey're not they're all they're alllockstep in line with the Democratparty there is no anarchism in punk rockit's not rebellious so I got left aloneand that's cool because all I reallywanted to do was just read comic bookswatch movies and be entertained and forseveral years that's what I did and Istarted talking to people I wouldn'tnormally talk to before and I found outthat this religious right that I was soscared of was a boogeyman it didn'texist that the religious right is theWestboro Baptist Church it's a Church of50 people out in BFE who show up everynow and then to protest a funeral that'sthe religious right that I was so scaredof it didn't exist it was a boogeymanit's a boogeyman passed around by theleft that oh that's that these bigchurch is gonna come and take all ofyour freedoms so a few years ago I startnoticing that there's a lot of overtlyprogressive messages in the comic booksI'm reading and I'm talking to a friendabout this and he says oh that's whatsjw's do they'll infiltrate an industryand no use it to bully their messageacross to you and if you don't believein them message they'll say well youhave no business reading our art form orbeing involved in this hobby so I waslike what's an sjw and so he links me toyoutube video that leads to another oneanother one another one I get red pillI'm straight down the rabbit hole in twoweeks I can tell you everything aboutgamergate there's culture war and Istarted seeing with these sjw's Istarted seeing a lot of the person Iused to be and I I didn't like who Iused to be and I was so glad I grew outof being that person over the years I'dspent out of punk rock and talking tothese people because I've realized thatI was a racist person back then and thereason for this is I knew a girl and shewas Jewish and she also consideredherself conservative and I told her Iwas like dude how how could you beconservative in Jewish that that don'tgo together and I I was so racistbecause I was denying her her autonomyas a person now I don't like sexismI don't like racism I don't likehomophobia I don't like any of that andI didn't back then but I was too blindedby what I was doing to realize howracist I wasand it's really racist one of you denyit's really racist sexist or homophobicone of you denies someone their economyas a person to make up their own lineand think that their ethnicity or theirgender or their race or their sexualityor anything like that needs to dominatehow they think so I did I found out Ididn't like who I used to be I wantedthese people on the left to leave mealone they wouldn't leave me alone doneit alone four trumpets a giant middlefinger to these people now and that'sbasically the only reason I voted forTrump I don't have buyer's remorse evenI think he's done a good job as apresident so you know my middle fingerworked out in several different ways ittold them to leave me alone and we gotan alright president out that he's noCalvin Coolidge but he's alright soanyhow I read this book recently calledleft in the dark by God by this Frenchphilosopher his name is Bernard Henry lavie and it's all about neo progressivismand how it's taken over the left wing ofpolitics it was written about ten yearsago and in the book he talked about howneo progressivism is anti-liberal it'santi-american it's anti-semitic and it'spro Islamofascist and he's attacked theright because that's what neoprogressivism is and that is what'staken over the Democratic Party and thepolitical left I want people on here toanyone who sees this video to check outthe book just kind of read about thebook if you want to you ain't got toread the whole book but read about itand learn

principles instead of bowing tothe neo progressives we all just need towalk away and if the right is willing togive us a home maybe that's where weneed to beso I've been watching a lot of thesewalkaway videos that a couple days and Ithought maybe I should add my own voiceand my own story to this let's go back10 years in 2008 Bush was on his way outas president I hated bush the reason Ihated bush was because I've worked witha bunch of like blue-collar factory tugswho told me that I should hate bushbecause bush was keeping the workingclass down I played in punk bands all myfavorite punk bands told me I had tohate Bush because he was just the mostevil Republican ever Bad Religion noeffects all those tough bands so I hatedbush I was reading books by Howard kennoam chomsky reading the crime thinkbooks I was very hard like this I was soafraid that a religious Rite was goingto take over like a Nazi regime just soafraid of this religious right thing soanyhow I was basically auntie funtraining one morning this guy I workedwith came up to me and we're talking andhe said you know if these Republicansare gonna keep calling us communists weneed to call them what they are they'refascist because Mussolini said thatfascism is capitalism now me I like tolook things up so I get off work I goand I check it out on the internet I'mlooking this up I couldn't find this Icouldn't find any more where Mussoliniat said anything remotely close to thiswhat I found was the exact opposite Ifound that Mussolini was a huge studentof Karl Marxhe loved the Communist Manifestohe actually Mussolini actually spentmore money than Italy had on socialprograms and that the word fascist camefrom this word feces which was a bundleof sticks and that was miscellaneousgoal for Italy was for it to be likethis bundle of sticks that cannot bebrokenit was collectivism and it was communismso I learned that Mussolini was acommunist and fascism was a form ofcommunism so then I get to looking intothe economics of the Nazi Party and it'sgot the word socialist in the name solet's see how socialist they areI stumbled upon the nineties 25-pointprogram now in the 25-point programpoints 13 14 16 17 and 18 all had to dowith redistribution of wealth and seasonthe means of production by thegovernment point 15 had to do withSocial Welfare point 20 had to do withsocialized education and there wasnothing about universal health care inthere but that's because the not ourGermany had already implementedsocialized health care in 1880 but theNazis didn't bother trying to do awaywith it they actually took advantage ofthe government's control over healthcare to put to do their euthanasiaprograms and several things like thatalso found out that in Nazi Germany thetop four percent were taxed 50 percentof their earnings and I also found outthat Hitler several Thomson speechestalked about real socialism and whatreal socialism wasn't that over there inRussia they weren't doing real socialismso this kind of resonated with mebecause with all the same things I wassaying these were the kinds of policiesthat as this left-wing factory workerpunk-rockerI was telling people and I was tellingpeople constantly you know realsocialism and have been tried and thatthat was the same thing Hitler wassaying and it was just he was wrong so Ibacked away I backed away from all thatand I started telling people I don'twant to talk about politics I just don'twant any part of this discussion and ifpeople would talk to politics about meI'd say well you know the Democrats andthis and then I bring up the thepolicies of Nazi Germany and then I gotwhat I wanted I got left alone none ofthe punk rockers wanted to talk to menobody I worked with wanted to talk tome because I was all of a sudden talkingbad about the Democrats you know itwasn't that I wouldn't talk bad aboutRepublicans I talked bad about them tooI hated them too still but the fact thatI started talking bad about Democratsand that's the thing about punk rockthey all claim to be anarchist butthey're not they're all they're alllockstep in line with the Democratparty there is no anarchism in punk rockit's not rebellious so I got left aloneand that's cool because all I reallywanted to do was just read comic bookswatch movies and be entertained and forseveral years that's what I did and Istarted talking to people I wouldn'tnormally talk to before and I found outthat this religious right that I was soscared of was a boogeyman it didn'texist that the religious right is theWestboro Baptist Church it's a Church of50 people out in BFE who show up everynow and then to protest a funeral that'sthe religious right that I was so scaredof it didn't exist it was a boogeymanit's a boogeyman passed around by theleft that oh that's that these bigchurch is gonna come and take all ofyour freedoms so a few years ago I startnoticing that there's a lot of overtlyprogressive messages in the comic booksI'm reading and I'm talking to a friendabout this and he says oh that's whatsjw's do they'll infiltrate an industryand no use it to bully their messageacross to you and if you don't believein them message they'll say well youhave no business reading our art form orbeing involved in this hobby so I waslike what's an sjw and so he links me toyoutube video that leads to another oneanother one another one I get red pillI'm straight down the rabbit hole in twoweeks I can tell you everything aboutgamergate there's culture war and Istarted seeing with these sjw's Istarted seeing a lot of the person Iused to be and I I didn't like who Iused to be and I was so glad I grew outof being that person over the years I'dspent out of punk rock and talking tothese people because I've realized thatI was a racist person back then and thereason for this is I knew a girl and shewas Jewish and she also consideredherself conservative and I told her Iwas like dude how how could you beconservative in Jewish that that don'tgo together and I I was so racistbecause I was denying her her autonomyas a person now I don't like sexismI don't like racism I don't likehomophobia I don't like any of that andI didn't back then but I was too blindedby what I was doing to realize howracist I wasand it's really racist one of you denyit's really racist sexist or homophobicone of you denies someone their economyas a person to make up their own lineand think that their ethnicity or theirgender or their race or their sexualityor anything like that needs to dominatehow they think so I did I found out Ididn't like who I used to be I wantedthese people on the left to leave mealone they wouldn't leave me alone doneit alone four trumpets a giant middlefinger to these people now and that'sbasically the only reason I voted forTrump I don't have buyer's remorse evenI think he's done a good job as apresident so you know my middle fingerworked out in several different ways ittold them to leave me alone and we gotan alright president out that he's noCalvin Coolidge but he's alright soanyhow I read this book recently calledleft in the dark by God by this Frenchphilosopher his name is Bernard Henry lavie and it's all about neo progressivismand how it's taken over the left wing ofpolitics it was written about ten yearsago and in the book he talked about howneo progressivism is anti-liberal it'santi-american it's anti-semitic and it'spro Islamofascist and he's attacked theright because that's what neoprogressivism is and that is what'staken over the Democratic Party and thepolitical left I want people on here toanyone who sees this video to check outthe book just kind of read about thebook if you want to you ain't got toread the whole book but read about itand learn the definitions of thesethings

hi everyonemy name is aydah and this is mywalk away story the story of mewalking away from the democratic partyum this is the first time i'm ever doingsomething like thisbut i've had this needto want to say everything that i'm aboutto sayfor the longest time and it's reallysignificant because i'm recording thison september 29th 2020 the night of thefirst presidential debate betweenpresident trump and um democraticcandidate joe bidenthis is such a pivotal moment in ourhistoryand i think it's really important foreveryone's voice to be heard butespecially conservative voices who havefor so long been really oppressedand looked down upon by mainstream mediaand society today i wanted to share thisbecausei've recently in the last few years beenthrough a lot andthose experiences that i went throughhaveopened my eyes to what the democraticparty really isand has made me leave completelyum so i actually was born and raised innew york cityuh i went to public school my entirelifeum my parents are actually immigrantsum they fled communist china actuallycame here with nothing in their pocketsworkedthree jobs night and dayin order to pay to for their kids toeat and and go to school education was ahuge part of my childhoodit was part of our culture and familywas and the family unit stickingtogether wasanother another part and those thingsyou know lookingas a kid you look at those things assomething that's being really annoyingorreally overbearing but looking at it nowas an adultyou realize that those werevalues that really contributed towho i am as a person today and i'mreally gratefulum for for those things that they'veinstilleduh they instilled the values of hardwork of a strong family unit of beingable tobe productive and having rewards in lifethat come after working really hardhaving delayed gratification beinghumbleand never complaining uh never makingyourself a victimright and so those things have beenreally pivotal to my journeybut at the same time i you know when iwas youngeri had those things happen and i didn'trealize how important they wereand i thought you know as a kid ithought they were just really annoyingand i ended up just being surrounded byother liberal folks in new york city ofcourse which is one of the mostliberal cities you could possibly be inin the countryand i was brainwashed into basicallythinking that new york city is thecenter of the worldthat all the other states in the uniondon't matterso states there's basically the statesbetween california and new yorkthat whole section or just fly overstates they're relevant the people thereare stupid um or just all farmersand then everyone in the city is uhwe're just we just live in our ivorytowers and everyone in the city is justsmart and educated and we wewere progressive ones umand so i was brainwashed into thinkingthat was the case and so every type ofmentality and thoughts that an opinionthat happened in new york i just ii absorbed them as my own umeven ones looking back on it i realizedthat we're hatefulum so i went throughum public school and then iended up going to a private universityand how universities are brainwashing alot of ourkids these days that's a whole differentstory but also looking back on it now imean i'm grateful for my experience butthere's a lot ofthings that went wrong in that sensewith the culture there and then afterschool i actuallymoved to san francisco for the lastuh and where i was there for the lastthree years and i recently leftbecause of the left um so i moved to sanfranciscothinking that i would be in the epitomeof a liberal cityin a liberal state and i would finallybe of my peoplei would finally be umpart of a you know this culture thati've always seen on tvand on the media and i wentand um i discovered that all of theseleftist policies that we were preachingand talking about in new york city wereactually a failureand were actually hurting the peoplethat it's that it's claiming to helpum and it's creating way more pain anduhand and poverty in our world todayi went to san francisco to do socialworkand so as you can imagine i had thereallythe background um the the behind thescenesof what it's like uh to have theseextremedemocratic socialist type policiesum and how it really affects peopleso i was working with women in rehab whowere coming out of addictioncoming out of jail and coming off thestreets for addictionsnow of course addictions isa really sad and um really complexsituationand i genuinely hope that we can find abipartisanway to find a solution for all thosepeople that have been affectedbut a lot of these women wereafter they finished their rehab theywere coddledto an extent where they basicallywere used to not becoming productivecitizensum being able to produce or contributeback to societyso for one example there was this womani talked to who was part of the programwho was thereuh for a year and she was two years outand two years silver which is amazingyou know great for herum but then i started talking to herabout you know what are your what areyour plans now like what'swhat what do you what would you like todo you know and let me help youget to where you want to go um andfor the last two years she was living inaa home provided by the cityfrom our taxes and she was likei said hey why don't you look for a jobi'd love to help youum you know find something um there's acoupleuh you know echi level roles that areout there and it'd be really great tostartsaving up money for you to be a littlebit more financiallyindependent and she looked at me andshe's likeno i don't want to work because she wasjust so used to getting things forfree there was also this woman i talkedtowho she she saidoh you know i'm gonna finish thisprogram in three months and then after ifinish this program in three months i'mgoing to getum this free housing free section 8housing i'm going to get my free foodvouchersi'm going to get free education andchild care for my schoolfree medicare um through the cityand finally i get my free obama phoneand then i'll be set for lifeand that honestly really broke my heartbecauseshe's equating um the success of herlifeto how much free stuff she can get andto me that's just a reallymessed up perspective on how to livelife and how to be happyyou're just going to keep getting thingsand keep getting these entitlements umbut not really working for yourself orat least seeing the value of that orunderstanding like where this actuallyis coming from it's coming from my taxmoneyum people that are truly capable ofworking and again i know addiction is avery complex thing butyou know they also were physically ableif we can find a bipartisan approachto really help these people get back ontheir feet and not just giving themfree stuff and entitlements and welfarewhich is really prevalent in thecalifornia systemthat would be way more effective butunfortunately i think all of thepolicies that havebeen passed in california have done thisharm and have created this culture and idon't thinkunfortunately there's there's no turningback from thatum these are adults already that havebeen living their whole life in thissystemand it's keeping them down instead ofgiving them the financial freedom andempowerment that they needto live a happy healthy life so thatthings like that really broke my heartum i would say also from my experiencein san franciscoworking in the social work area ivolunteered for some schools um itutored some kids and taught someenrichment classesfor some extra cash plus you know youknow work in social work there's like nomoney so i was making some extra cashand one day i was in a high schoolin the city really really well off thesepeople arethis is a private high school that costslike forty five thousand dollars a yearso true granted that a lot of peoplethereum probably have some money you knowsome people are in scholarship someyou know some kids have um grants andstuff so that's great but like for themost part a lot of these kids have somemoney likea lot of money okay so and this is likea high schoolso in a freshman class these 14 yearoldsthe teacher was giving out pamphletsabout how to protestlike how to protest properly and not getarrested orlike knowing your rights when police umwhen police go to your protest likedon't talk to the police you know youdon't you have every rightto um to not say your informationyou know bring bring bring a maskbring a mace bring an emergency contactnumber in your bag seeing that for 1413 and 14 year olds i mean to me thatwas really disturbingum just the fact that they're pushingthisagenda onto our children so youngand not giving them at least the abilityto make their own decisions about whatis right and wronglike they're just telling them hey goout and protest but do they even knowwhat they're protestingor do they even know all the facts anddetails about thatit was really disturbing umso after social work i actuallyum worked in techin silicon valley san francisco okay sofor a lot of people that areconservatives and republicansthere you know there's a wholeconversation about how silicon valleyis really um is really suppressing thevoices of conservative speakersand honestly that is really true umi there wasn't a day i was there where ifelt likei was able to be myself and fullyexpress my opinionsum a lot of people were just under thisuhthis following this liberal agenda andnotletting other voices be heard um andthat was really disappointing especiallyin such a what they claim is to be sucha progressiveand uh exciting place full of diverseideas and opinionsthere was so much political correctnessthere it honestly drove me crazyand i'm not working there anymore andi'm really gladit just really made me not my particularcompany i just want to put that outthere because i don't want to put anythrow anyone under the busbut i'm just saying the culture of thesilicon valley tech world in generalit's just really disappointingwhat it has turned into um in that it'ssuppressing a lot of voices uh differentopinionsand putting the blame onon conservative speakers instead ofallowing them toexpress themselves and have freedom ofspeechum the other thing i also wanted to talkabout was just likemy own personal journey withmy faith and that also hasbeen a real big reason why i left theleftrecently in the last few years i've beenreally reconnecting with mybelief in in jesus and in godand i'm a proud christian and ihave these values and morals withinmyself now that i would not havehad a few years ago and so in terms ofmy faith journey i'm really glad that iam where i amum but as i continue down my faithjourney i realized thatthe what the ways that the democraticparty is thinkingis extremely anti-christianand in fact a lot of the things thatthey want to do involve taking awaygod in our societyas well as completely backing away fromthe judeo-christian beliefs thatthis country was founded on umso for example the whole idea of everysingle personbeing oppressed in some way except ifyou're if you're a white male then youareat the top of the food chain buteveryone elseis oppressed in some way um so for meum i'm a woman so i'm oppressed by malesum but i'm i'm asian soand i so i'm going to rank higher thanum likeafrican-american or latino personbut i'm a child of immigrants and i'mfirst in my fam first generation soyou know maybe i get a little bit of apush in terms of like my oppressionscaleit's just absurd like just having theseoppression olympicsum and comparing and and saying likeyou'reyou can't have an opinion because you'remoreyou're less oppressed than me eventhough you don't know my story you don'tknow everythingi've been through and i don't know yourstory but you're going to judge mejust based off how i look ormy external identity to me that'sthat is actual discriminationthat is discrimination um you know onthe faith-based perspectivejesus died on the cross for us to befreeand so if we not for us todo that on the cross for us to be freenot to be a victim so if we go throughlife just being victimsthen that is then jesus's sacrifice wasuh was not worth it and obviously wewant it to be worth itum and so iti noticed that a lot of thedemocrat policies is basically sayingyou knowyou are oppressed because you are fromthisgroup and because of thatwe're going to keep lowering the levelfor youlowering the bar for you not settinghigh enough expectations because you'renot going to get those expectationsanyway because you are that this type ofpersonand we're going to keep giving you allthese freethings or incentives or programs andjust throw them at youjust so that you can um just so you cancompete against you know the white manbecause you can't you can't reach themyou can't reach their levelum and you know but if you keep if youkeep tellingsomeone that they're oppressed andyou're never going to begood enough uh because ofthe oppressor and then you keep bendingthethe circumstances and the rules and theand the requirements just so that theycan reach thisthis level but they're never good enoughto get there on their ownthen this person is never going tosucceed on their ownthey're always going to go through lifelooking for the nextum like incentive or like the nextuh like thingfor them to hold on to so that they canbecome betterrather than relying on themselves and soto me that was justreally anti antichrist becauseyou were automatically judging thesepeopleum and you're not letting them havenot letting them work to their fullestpotentialit's an insult to the human potential byjust continuing to say that people areoppressedor that you are a victim you know soto me that was just really disturbing umseeing all this unfoldand then finally i would say is just theculturethat the leftists have created umi really saw this in san francisco andeven here in new york cityboth cities being very liberalbut i saw how the liberal policiesdestroyedsan francisco there's poop and needleson the floor andyou know i'm not going to i'm notexaggerating likepeople talk about this in the news allthe time it's truelike there's poop and needles on thefloor there are peoplehomeless people you know camped all outin downtownand the thing is people have acceptedthis this is not an acceptable thingpeople have become so like they they'reignoring it they justsay it's every part of everyday life andit justblows my mind that people will continueto vote for policies that keeppeople in poverty like this that keeppeople on the streets and keep thesethese streets dirty you know wordswe're paying you know in california theincome state tax is the highest in thecountrywhere is that money going okay it'sgoing into the pockets ofthe democrat politicians it's not goingto infrastructureit's not going to build mentalinstitutions for thegenuine genuinely mentally ill peoplethat are just thrown out into thestreetsokay it's being um it's not being puttowards umyou know fixing the homeless problemfixing the drug problemand forcing the police so that they cangetall these druggies and drug lords offthe streetsinstead it's being used for this bullettrain that actually never happenedand this ferris wheel in golden gatepark thatgot built halfway and it got shut downlike it'sit's absurd this this money andall these resources that we're puttinginto these policies thatthese democrat policies aren't they'renot going anywhere and i think it'sreally time for us toto wake up people are are have become aculture where they're okay withwalking past this pain and theseterrible scenesi don't understand why you know if youare a true if you genuinely careyou know you democrats like to callthemselves the party of people that carethat's why they want to vote for allthese socialist policies thatdistribute everything uh distribute thewealth to every single person and givepeople things for freebut at the same time their hearts are sohardened where they walk pastall these homeless and needles and poopon the street that their own policieshave causedyou're not going to do or say anythingabout it you're just going to ignoreyou're going to keep voting for the samepolicies thatstarted this in the first place itdoesn't make sense to me andi genuinely pray that peopleon on on the left can can seethe error of their ways um or at leastbegin tobe open to hearing the voices ofconservativeswho could probably offer a solution to alot of those problems for your citiesum finallyoh i know i said finally five times butthis is one more thing i want to mentionis just like the cultureum obviously we know all the riots thathave been happeningand the same could be said here in newyork city new york city actually justgotlabeled as um i forget the official termi think it's like aterror no not terrorist well it's it'skind of like a terroristthing but umi forget what it's called if you if youknow please leave a comment but it wasseattle portland and new york cityuh where the the three cities for likedomestic you know antifayou know all the riots and domesticterrorism there's like an officialterm for that um so just one great citythat i was born and raisedin for the last 20 plus yearshas now turned into basically a thirdworld countrywhich is um really crazy to think aboutwithin the last few years and peoplehave accepted thispeople have accepted the fact it's okaytoburn down small businesses most of theminority and immigrant ownedum most a lot of them owned by my fr myfriendsand by people i know and my neighborswho nowlost their entire livelihood and thenthe response to that isoh well they have insurance um no theydon't they haveabout a few hundred thousand dollars oflossof of lost money andthey're already suffering because of theshutdown some coventhat is completely heartless to justbrush that off completelyas a response to uman unfortunate police shooting now thewhole you knowpolice brutality thing is another thingthat i could make another video onbut the point is is that violence is notthe answeruh like to like to violence basicallylike if you look at history um like intheuh i believe is in birmingham with rosaparks andshe you know refused to get off thefront seat of the busand how they protested was through afree marketit was through capitalism it was throughnot giving businesses to the busand all the african-americans startedcarpooling or walking instead and sobecause the bus companieshad suffered so so financiallythey that's when the law finally changeduhfor them to allow both black and whitepeopleequally and different and on on the sameparts of the busand so that's just an example ofhow actual protests can be done withouthurting innocent people and destroyingthe lives of innocent bystanders ormurderingum a lot of you know peaceful proteststhat actually areriots and murders butthis left the leftist culture havoc hasaccepted this as okayas a proper excuse um tolet out their feelings it'sit's concerning i really pray that theycan see the error of their ways and theycan see thatthat is not the proper way to to goabout thingsthe proper way is for all of us tolisten to each otherum and have an open mind and open heartto bring god back into our societyand into our culture and to have a freemarketi mean ideally that would be the idealsituationanyways i'm ranting now there's a lot ofreasons but i hope i was able tosummarize thisas a long video but i hope i was able toexpress my feelingsin the best way that i could um as towhy i'm leaving the leftand with that being said this year2020 will be the first year that i'll bevoting for a republican and i will bevoting fortrump um i did vote for hillary clintonin 2016and again that was why the reason why isbecause i thoughtthat's what i had to do you know as aas a east coaster as a womanum and because i you know i was underthe impression thattrump was this racist sexistum person i meanlisten there are definitely clips of himwhere he might not have he mighthave the most he might have pretty brashresponsesbut in life not everyone's going to benice like that's just the way lifeis at the end of the day as long as hegets the work doneand gets things accomplished that's allthat matters to meand so far from what i've seen with thenumbersand what he's been able to produce he'sit looks like he's been doing thatand so this year i have registered as arepublican and i will be voting in theelectionsand i really hope and pray that we canall come together to have a bipartisanapproach to a lot of these issues and atthe end of the day just be americans andlove this countryum and and love this country that hasgiven so muchto me to you to my parents who literallycame here with nothingand worked three jobs and made a lifeout of themselvesup made a life for themselves and fortheir familyum so i hope that we can umjust really find peace with each otheranyways thank you so much for listeningand uh peace thank you
all right everyone I figured I'd make mywalkaway video no hashtag walk away it'sbasically a sub movement right nowencouraging people to leave theDemocratic Party for various reasons alot of people I think it's they'reactually further left and they'releaving it because it's led by someonelike Pelosi who's not actuallytechnically on the Left we got tounderstand you know a lot of people ifthey're like partisan Republicans theyalways make the mistake well theDemocrats are totally far left thetotally liberal well yeah they got someMarxist tendencies that's sure but youknow then there are a lot of Republicansthey're basically 95 percent the samewhat's the difference between JohnMcCain and Hillary Clinton John McCainis more of validly and unabashedlypro-war whereas Hillary Clinton's morelike hush-hush about it and then laughsabout it afterwards once genocides beencommitted like in Libya not a bigdifference to be sure both a couple ofchickenhawks basically but I figured Iwould relate for anyone who doesn't knowthis because I don't know that I'vementioned it in the in the course of mypolitical analysis in some years andover a hundred thousand people I thinkit probably joined this channel since Ilast told it I figured I would talkabout basically why I left theDemocratic Party you know in more depthbecause I've mentioned I voted for Obamain 2008 that was the first time that Ivoted I wasn't quite old enough to votefor w or John Kerry but it's like inthat election I pry this was stayed homewho [ __ ] cares they're both putthey're both old boring war mongerbasically corporate centrists where'sthe choice there is none w happens to belike a foot shorter and a little bitless coherent and John Kerry's far moreboring not a big difference if thenthey're both boring ultimately W isbasically an absentee president for thelast two years didn't want to make anyappearances because he'd grown sounpopular like sub 20% approval atcertain points and then I voted for RonPaul in 2012 you got a nurse understandI'm not a Republican I've never joined aparty in any official capacity I'venever donated to a political campaign Ithought about it with Ron Paul I alsothought about it with Rand I I backedhonestly in this last election mycandidate of first choice was Rand Paulthat's the person I wantto be the standard-bearer of theRepublican Party when Rand Paul endorsedDonald Trump it became possible for meto then vote for him if he if he hadrefused to if he had become never Trumprighta said well I trust rands instinctsand you know I like the cut of his jibbasically maybe I'll have to think moreabout this and when you gotta rememberwhen Trump chose Mike Pence leave AngeloKhan is his running mate I wasn't surethat I could stay on board for a briefmoment in time I was like log I'll goback to basically the default which isthe libertarian party at this point butthen Garry Johnson went nutso is likeyou know well now everyone else is nutsat least Trump is saying essentially andI don't think he'll start a nuclear wardo something stupid by the way I don'tbelieve in the third month third partyis a wasted vote meme because it is it'slike you know vote for a party that'snot worth governing is a memeessentially it is essentially theDemocrats so I chose to do hashtag walkaway around 2010 and the reason maysurprise some people because I've beencast off as like well you're on theright you're a conservative or or youknow whatever you're an extremistbecause you believe in free speech it'sa form of extremism now I guessbelieving the Constitution what I wouldsay is the reason why I went from votingObama in 2008 to within the first coupleof years really being like yeah you knowI I had considered myself vaguely to bea liberal kind of a Democrat at the timebut then I'm like [ __ ] this Obama didn'tdo any of the things that he wassupposed to do for a voter like me myprimary concern was hey the economy iscollapsing and I'm about to entercollege not great but really it was theIraq war government surveillance thingslike that Obama expanded thesurveillance apparatus he at leasttemporarily expanded the scope ofoperations in Iraq and Afghanistan henever got us out of either of thoseconflicts we're still there to this daythey've been scaled back especially inIraq now because some stability wasachieved well you know the goal ofridding the area of Isis predominantlyhas worked you know it's still a concernthat still exists but it's it's betteras a rule than it was before for someyears meanwhile in Afghanistan we'veactually added more troops which I'm nothappy about I would just leave thesituation entirely saying the Afghangovernment yoursnation I would be willing to payreparations for infrastructure damagethat our military did over time butultimately it's not our battle we cansend in contractors we can see you canhire mercenaries certainly if you wantto we can have an advisory position butwe're not going to fight your battle foryou you've got to do that on your ownmaybe you'd think about justslaughtering the Taliban and thewholesale and see what happens maybe youwould be better of course you get aproblem with different tribes not reallywanting to be near each other in theinternational capacity but Obama he wasan anti-war see people saying we'll usesome remarkable progressive like he wasthe first gay president no no all he didwas back off of defending DOMA that'slike I supported gay marriage before theObama era had no problem it's likethere's one thing a bush you knowearthed me on he's like well you knowtraditional marriage we need the Defenseof Marriage Actit's like [ __ ] no we don't know wedon't need anything any such thing it'sa government contract we're not talkingabout invading the church or somethinghe was never on the forefront of actualmoral progress or social progress Ishould say he wasn't really a liberaland even really the fiscal sense heraised taxes didn't health insurancemandate but that was just corporatehealth care I opposed the ACA totally Ithink it should be entirely ripped apartreplace with the system we were usingseem to work fine to me yeah everysystem has its quirks but just the factthat something is broken doesn't meanthat you know hitting it with a hammeris going to fix it yeah maybe a littlebit but another chunk might fall off whoknows the reason that I chose to walkaway from the Democratic Party reallythough ultimately is because theDemocrats walked away from me look theposition of the left in general theyoung left in the mid 2000 talking theBush era Pro free speech and governmentsurveillanceno more proxy wars that's [ __ ] weneed accountability we need a governmentthat appear at least appears to give adamn about the situation becausecurrently under Bush we didn't theDemocratic Party once it actually gotcontrol though within a few years it wasevident they weren't going to do any ofthose things they kept the surveillanceup they kept the war mongering up theykept the the censorship [ __ ] up themoral haranguingthe hand-wringing they were they werewilling to work with Republicans and getpast something unanimously if it was ashitty idea but if it was a good ideagot bogged down in committee and neverwent anywhereGitmo never closed it's a you know stillopen I believe to this day well that'sit that's funnythat was one of his main campaignpromises I will close Guantanamo hey mr.president when are you gonna get aroundto that no I don't know 20,000 yearsfrom now maybe it's rude um Obama did afew things that were okay on theDemocrats at the time as well the Cubanembargo ending was a good thing Obamadidn't get in the way of our oil boom Ithought that was good although on thatyou know if he had actually crowed aboutthat a lot of his own fans would havecried foul because it may like you sayI'm like a far-right Republican you wantto poison the whales with natural gasdrilling or something they would havesaid something like that but theDemocrats that had been when they werean outside movement anti-surveillance ananti opaque government and protransparency and pro peace they they'veentirely flipped during the Obama eraand then they dared they had theaudacity to call people like me racistfor daring to criticize Obama with thesame criticisms as we were levyingagainst Bush that's what the DemocraticParty did now they've made their bed nowthey have to lay in it they oversawyears and years of fiscal crisis andendless war mongering it was ridiculousit was totally ridiculous known betterand now they've suffered now as a resultof their mishandling of the economy anda foreign policy especially Trump is incharge and I voted for Donald Trump Ichose to walk away from the Democratsnow I'm not a dove straight ballot youknow well I'm going to vote non-stopRepublicans I'm not a Republican I neverwill be a Republican as long as peoplelike Pat Robertson and Rick Santorumexist I can never join and support fullythe Republican Party but there are someRepublicans with sense I still like RandPaul and his dad Ron Paul and probablyeveryone else in their family theyseemed down-to-earth people only like anactual you know a virgin family that hasand become rich because so many of themhave been in Congress now Trump he's amulti-billionaire business Democrat he'sone of the few sane Democrats left andhe is bighe has an R after his name that's theparty as far as this ideology goes he'snot some holy warrior oh I'm a HolyRoller now says Donald Trump and I ownten machine guns now that's not him noabsolutelyhe's a Manhattan penthouse dweller sortof like Bloomberg in that capacity ifBloomberg had more money and more IQpoints he could pass for Donald Trumpwe're never gonna hear that from themedia they delight rather cast him offis like a far-right Nazi or somethingwhich is totally ridiculous as well andthe Democrats I choose to keep walkingaway from them because they keep walkingin a very leftward direction and it'sreally ridiculous because it's not goingto work it's it's bad as a campaignstrategy they've gone way out in leftfield they've convinced themselves thatif they said talk about socialismsomehow that's going to win themelections okay maybe in New York Citymaybe in California not nationwide it'snever gonna happencountry is beginning to move in theopposite direction they've lost thattheir final issue is immigration andthey lost on it it's now marchingthrough July in August there's nocampaigning for a lot of those criticalseats that the Democrats can do becausesix of those positions they're gonnahave no August recess in the Senate sothe Democrats have made their bed andthey have to lay in it the walk awaything I saw some people yesterday tryingin vain to defend the left they're likeOh walk away hashtag is being printedspread by BOTS and I'm like hey you knowI've got a quarter million subscriberson YouTube go ahead and call me a bot myfans know better and I'm like I'mbasically part of this it's just thatI'm not walking away now I walked awayyou know from back in 2010 I had to theDemocratic Party began to shift towardscorporatism towards establishment Ariansort of authoritarianism and towardsfar-left ISM and at a high tax model andit still is right now it still hasn'tlearned it's lesson this is why I thinkTrump probably wins the second term I'mnot alone in thinking that you look atthe keys to the White House dude I'msure that by then by 2020 Trump willprobably have sealed the deal and hisestimation to be funny to see what ScottAdams says a lot of people just knew himas the cartoonist for Dilbertof course he was better on the electionalong with Manu and then Serna [ __ ] andsome others than people that they likemake seven figures here specifically tobe political analysts like 1/8 silver hemakes no money hand overhe has the penthouse and the tequilashots and stuff and he didn't know whatwas going on he doesn't know theDemocratic Party almost walked away fromme more than I walked away from theDemocratic Party I would still considervoting for them but they've got tobecome worth voting for give me acandidate that's actually worth castinga ballot for maybe you can get my votebut right now I'm looking at theDemocrats I'm not really seeing muchthere's really not a lot there is thatthere talk about who you Kamala Harrisfor president 22 Joe Biden haven't youtried this before are you nutsyou're gonna get stomped into into a mudpatch by Trump if he try to put Biden orcould' or Bernie Sanders against itpretty Santas isn't gonna run heprobably won't even be alive by 2020 thedudes in his mid-70s already he'd bealmost 80 by that point do you thinkthat an 80 year old man is capable ofcampaigning very hard now when apolitician is that old it's because theyno longer really have to campaignbecause they're a perpetual fixture ofCongress or some Supreme Court justicewho doesn't have to campaign at all theycan sit there and be demented nobody canget rid of them takes an inordinateeffort to get rid of them never happenshaven't there only ever been two SCOTUSjustices ever actually removed from thatposition in the history of the UnitedStates or something it's some insanelytiny number the number of people thatget impeached from their officessurprisingly low considering the numberof crimes that are committed in DC everysingle day mostly they resigned so theycan keep their pension that's reallywise I suppose a basic get out of ourway yeah you broke the law we'll forgiveand forget but you know you got to getout of office because you become apolitical liability so [ __ ] resignit's basically that's like AnthonyWeiner doesn't he still technically Ithink get his pension and stuff behilariousthat's about all P cell

iwouldn't be doing a videoif it weren't for the fact that ipromised brandon and i met himwhen he was in washington state and flewfrom hawaii and gave him a lay andlisten to him speakand it was fantastic so i made thispromise and i have to do it before theend of the monthand it's like so hard anywayum i came from a democrat familymy great-grandmother and my grandmotherwere washington state in the washingtonstatelegislature and senate um so growing upi was just indoctrinated as a democratalthough i really didn't know what thatmeantand um i didn't ummy grandmother uh took us to washingtond.cand um i when i was a little girl i metkennedyand i met um nixon who i really hatedwhich actuallywas the emphasis for me to walk awayand so i'm a walk with and um i neverfelt good about him even as a littlegirl i didn't like him and soi had a hard time voting democrat afterthatum and i actually as when i becamevoting age justvoted as an independent up until umup until obama andat that point hillary clinton he was sosleazyand hillary backing himup and selling her so she wasthere was so much evil to her i umi began doing some research i hadfriends that started asking me questionsi couldn't answerwhen asked me if i knew anything aboutwhat had been going onin the world and i didn't because i wasraisingmy kids and i was trying tomy husband's in the background giving mea hard time nowand um and so i didn't pay attention toanythinguntil obama ran and from the get-gomy heart just in my stomach didn't feelgood about himand i had been starting to listen toglenn beckbill o'reilly ben shapiro rush limbaughstarted doing more research and readingschweikert and others that have writtenthings and istarted to watch and listen to thethings that were being said and judgeas a mom raising a family and othersi i started to realize what it was goingto do for my taxes for my kidsand i just couldn't um go there and sowhen obama won well actually i shouldback up becausei got super involved then i was workingfor an airline i had pass benefitsi started flying back and forth to dcfor ralliesand and my daughter who was in collegeat the time who up until the time thatshe went in her junior year away tocollegeum called me on my phone while i was inthe middle of a rallyi wanted to know what the i wasdoing thereand started hassling me about it whichactually was kind of hurtful and i toldher i was trying to save her country forherbut she didn't get it and i didn'trealize because i was sobusy working and trying toresearch and she was away at collegewhat they were doing to her her last twoyears of schoolshe came out really indoctrinatedand i didn't know that because we didn'thave verydeep conversations but i knew somethingwas wrong as a mom because ourconversations weren't very deep anymoreso um that's another storyand i'll get a little bit more to thatin the end but suffice it to say i gotsuper involved withtea party patriots we got we workedreally really hardwent to dc to fight against the umhealth care bill ieducated myself went online on facebookasked people toeducate me because i was going to flyover and i calledmy legislators office from washingtonstate at the timeand i made i made appointments to meetwith them allactual appointments knewie and i wasflying into meet with them all face to faceand none of them kept the appointmentsthey staffed them outactually one of them locked the door icould hear them behind the doorand i knocked on the office door and itold them there's a constituenthere from washington state i flew in andit took three tries to get them tofinally open the doorand when they opened the door otherpatriots that were there trying totalk to their legislators also criedagainwhich i'm sure was intimidating but theyall wanted toregister their complaints right aboutand their thoughts about it theirconcerns andum and i did get into jay inslee'soffice at the time he was thereand jay inslee rushed past mecoming back from wherever the heck hewas lunch or whateverdidn't meet with me locked the door iwas sitting there on a couchright outside his door never came out totalk to meso a staff member sat down with me wentover some thingstook some notes never got back to menever talked to me againnothing none of them did and umand so there was a huge rally thathappened that dayand i went back to my hotel room and icalled after the rallyi didn't see anything on tv and i wantedto see if there was anything on tv andthere wasn't and so i calledum the local news stations and all theyasked waswho are you and hung up on me and so thenext time that i cameinto town was for a glenn beck rally andit was massive 828. it was a massive rallyand um we jammed the metro andthe freeways it was huge i mean trulyhuge people got in the day beforeand you probably never saw anythingabout it unless you were there or youfollowed glenn backand um and that's when i really learnedabout the mediabecause i went back to my hotel room andi thought surelythere'll be something and there wasnothing no coverage at allnone and um and i had filmed for like atleasttwo hours from one of the parks where wegathered to walkum from this park up to the capitolbuildingand hold this rally and i filmed for agood two hours before my battery wentoutand it still wasn't the end of the linepeople came from all over the countryso i called all the major networksall their newsrooms each one of them whoare youa mom from washington state i attendedthis rally it wasmassive i wanted to know when you weregoing to cover it so i could watchthey would hang up every single one ofthem hung upand that's when i knew we were really introuble and backi loved going back he educated everybodyfori mean the stuff that i learned from himspeaking into the future about whatcould possibly be happening all of it'scome to passwhich is shocking because his researchteam must beunbelievable his contacts must beamazingso then fox

hi my name is Courtney Harris and thisis my walk away video um I was born andraised in the Democratic Party we werebrought up with the understanding thatand I got it's like a very old timelight that the DNC has been running fordecades is that the Democrats are forthe working man and the poor and theRepublicans are for the rich the wealthywe don't want we can't vote inRepublicans never vote in a Republicanand then I started to realize probablyabout 2011 2010 2011 that my viewsweren't really lining up with the partyI was told I had to that you know wehave to vote for because I was a workingmanI was not wealthy I I had to vote forthe DNC always vote Democrat straightballot always do it straight ticket justmark that one box and you're done youdon't have to do anything else and thenI really some of their views were notreally lining up with minealthough I'm not a traditionalRepublican or a traditional Democratbecause I believe in firearms I believethat if people want to smoke cannabisthey should peel the smoked cannabis youwant to get a gay marriage going tosame-sex people want to get married goahead it's not affecting my life in anyway want to have an abortion it's notfor me it's not a choice I would make Istill have my view of abortion and acertain trimester as murder but otherthan that whatever it doesn't affect mylife okay and that's where my viewsstarted to come in is because why shouldit affect me well 2016 came and yeah atfirst I wasn't supporting Trump I wasTed Cruz that's who I wanted how am Ireally like Ted Cruz even though he's alittle kind of sneaky looking MarcoRubio was kind of cool too but what theDemocratic Party had to offer was notanything that could sustain America okayum watching everything going on behindthe scenes you know not even behind thescenes just watching it right out in thein the daylight right on the wide open Imean you have a party that stole aprimary a party that went on with theutmost of confidence that they were notgoing to lose an electionit really disgusted me even further youknow and now you see these auntie fourpeople that are part of the extreme leftand they're going to any any ralliesthat they can to fight you have Democratleadership pretty much coercing theirand you know coercing and instigatingand telling they're telling theirconstituents to find Donald Trumpadministration to find out all Trumpsupporters and to cause problems tofight with them that right there is thatwas a reason why I walked awayyou have the utmost of ignoranceimmaturity and childish behavior goingon within your party and it's at theupper echelon of your leadership and youexpect people to take you serious no onewill take you serious when you're actinglike a two-year-old child you know youyou never saw any fight or any majorissues occurring at any Democratic canany of their rallies in the 2016election but the 2016 elections everysingle down at Trump rallyanything that was Republican and basedwas met with with protest and not withjust speech protests it was met withviolent protests you had people gettingbricks thrown at them sticks baseballbats okaydestroying cars you have one one of thefreakin oddDHS employees for the government had aheadless Burt animal on their porch okaythat that is whyI couldn't stay with the DemocraticParty I was not any of the names that Iwas being called that I had never beencalled any at any other time in my lifeuntil it was foundI support Donald Trump and it was thesame thing with everyone else includingDonald Trump and that's why I believeeveryone including President Trumpwalked awayhi my name is Courtney Harris and thisis my walk away video um I was born andraised in the Democratic Party we werebrought up with the understanding thatand I got it's like a very old timelight that the DNC has been running fordecades is that the Democrats are forthe working man and the poor and theRepublicans are for the rich the wealthywe don't want we can't vote inRepublicans never vote in a Republicanand then I started to realize probablyabout 2011 2010 2011 that my viewsweren't really lining up with the partyI was told I had to that you know wehave to vote for because I was a workingmanI was not wealthy I I had to vote forthe DNC always vote Democrat straightballot always do it straight ticket justmark that one box and you're done youdon't have to do anything else and thenI really some of their views were notreally lining up with minealthough I'm not a traditionalRepublican or a traditional Democratbecause I believe in firearms I believethat if people want to smoke cannabisthey should peel the smoked cannabis youwant to get a gay marriage going tosame-sex people want to get married goahead it's not affecting my life in anyway want to have an abortion it's notfor me it's not a choice I would make Istill have my view of abortion and acertain trimester as murder but otherthan that whatever it doesn't affect mylife okay and that's where my viewsstarted to come in is because why shouldit affect me well 2016 came and yeah atfirst I wasn't supporting Trump I wasTed Cruz that's who I wanted how am Ireally like Ted Cruz even though he's alittle kind of sneaky looking MarcoRubio was kind of cool too but what theDemocratic Party had to offer was notanything that could sustain America okayum watching everything going on behindthe scenes you know not even behind thescenes just watching it right out in thein the daylight right on the wide open Imean you have a party that stole aprimary a party that went on with theutmost of confidence that they were notgoing to lose an electionit really disgusted me even further youknow and now you see these auntie fourpeople that are part of the extreme leftand they're going to any any ralliesthat they can to fight you have Democratleadership pretty much coercing theirand you know coercing and instigatingand telling they're telling theirconstituents to find Donald Trumpadministration to find out all Trumpsupporters and to cause problems tofight with them that right there is thatwas a reason why I walked awayyou have the utmost of ignoranceimmaturity and childish behavior goingon within your party and it's at theupper echelon of your leadership and youexpect people to take you serious no onewill take you serious when you're actinglike a two-year-old child you know youyou never saw any fight or any majorissues occurring at any Democratic canany of their rallies in the 2016election but the 2016 elections everysingle down at Trump rallyanything that was Republican and basedwas met with with protest and not withjust speech protests it was met withviolent protests you had people gettingbricks thrown at them sticks baseballbats okaydestroying cars you have one one of thefreakin

hello walk away community excuse mebecause I am driving in my car right nowI guess I'm making a video of why Ichose to walk away from the left I wouldsay that I did that quite a while agoright after the election but I guess itstarted before I watched the electionclosely a few years ago and even to sayhere and a half leading up to it and Igrew up in a Republican household votingRepublican well I didn't end up turninglike thatI voted Democrat over since I was 18years oldObama twice Bush's second term andpretty much like state local governmentofficials probably 95% of them we'reDemocrat rarely would I have ever votedfor a RepublicanI've known about me who hasn't knownabout Trump for 35 years he's been ahousehold name him and his family we allknow how he's made his money who he iswhat he's done the businesses the hotelsbut I mean first impression is you knowhe's Trump you know ego New Yorker richbillionaire playboy but just watchingthe left and the media and even certainpoliticians and how they treated him andyeah we know Trump is you know Trump isTrump he says a lot of dumb things as weall do you know trying to ruffle upfeathers sometimes on purpose to get areaction but just how the Left treatedhim during the election was just unrealI mean I thought they treated BernieSanders bad he was rightbut with Trump it was quite the oppositeit was almost like a vengeful thing likethey hated him like pure hatred so but Ididn't want to change my views foranything because I was stuck straightvoting blue I've always done that I'vealways believed that and then after theelection it's like wow there's eyeopener for all of us really even thosewho voted for Trump I mean think aboutit who would have thought someone likeDonald Trump would run for president andwin and beat Hillary you know the saviorthe chosen one of the Democratic Partyit was all set up for her to win and shelost but I would say that was when it'smy views of the left change I mean Ifelt it but I didn't want to believe itI certainly didn't want to admit it butas time went on kind of grew closer tothe right and starting to like TrumpI mean his policies are what hispolicies are what he said he would dohe's done a lot that what he said hewould do if he became president I meanlook at the economy look at the jobs thetrade deals wages the stock market ifyou follow the stock market look atwhere it's a compared to what it wasjust four years agobut though the left itselfthey still don't want to see that theyhate Trump because he's Trump becausehe's a Republican because he's not aDemocrat he's not one of the good oldboys the elitistthat's what they become now they don'trepresent middle America you know thehard-working middle class you knoweveryday man they don't represent thatno more stop doing that a long time agoI can tell you firsthand from where Ilive at and where I'm from where I grewup part of is predominantly Democrat theother part is predominant Republican thepart that's predominantly Democrat thathas really changed much and maybe I'llget into where I'm from in another videoif I choose to do that because it doesit's a particular particular home of acertain presidential candidate on theDemocratic side but I'll get back towhere I was talking I chose to walk awayfrom the left and I don't think I'llever go backthey just they aren't who they've alwayssaid they are they're not who they usedto be when they say the phrase not yourfather's Democratic Party or yourgrandfather Democratic Party certainlyis the case this is not you know thedays of JFK and you know the fifties inthe greatest generation that era is longgone and I don't think it'll ever comeback so that's part of the reason why Iwalk from the left the other reasonswell there's other reasons toobut probably the biggest one is just thehypocrisy that they show this thehateful rhetoric the nonsense the liesthey hate Trump so much and so bad butyet they can't stop talking about himhe's on every news channelhe's on Fox News a lot they talk abouthim a lot but I compared to CNN NBC andthe others they talk about him prettymuch 24/7 if CNN couldn't talk aboutTrump they might know what it is thiswho would they talk aboutbut I just can't stand what the left hasbecome how its run by these rich elitistthat preach entitlement to younger tothe younger generation and they and it'sabout you know hate speech it's hurtinghate you know just you have a differenceof opinion you disagree with somebodyabout something they call you a racistthey call you a homophobe they call youanti-this anti-that I mean theyphysically and verbally will attack youover anything nowadays even when I was alittle kid it wasn't like thatnow it's total opposite and let's saywhat will it be like 20 years from nowyou know how how much worse can it getso I came across this walkaway movementnot long after the election and Iwatched about the videos that Brandisjakka made and I kind of agree with alot of things he was saying and I'm youknow watched and listened to his story Iwatched a lot of other videos aboutpeople sharing their walkaway stories aswell I had most of them just did like a1 or 2 video thing telling their storyand why they chose to walk away andothers have I guess made full YouTubechannels out of it they do videos everyother day and I follow us some of themit's just a lot of people too many tofollow all of them but some of the mainones I'm sure you do tooI want to hear what they gotta say youknow I listen to videos from everybodyof all walks a lot different Ray's colorparts of the country religion I meanevery everything and we're all inagreement about how the left and theDemocratic Party which was which oncestood for you know middle working classregular peoplethey don't do that no morenow I'm not gonna give praise 100%glorification to the Republican sidebecause you know they have their faultsas well I've never considered myselfeven going to be Republican I've alwaystried to stay close to the center as Ican I have I know I did the last uhmidterm election I did vote Republicanon every single person I could in mystate but I'm not going to just join aparty because I left the other one Imaybe I will but for now I'm just gonnastay independent cuz I don't want tobelong to a certain party or a certaingroup because I've always tried tothink for myself or just hard to do thatwhen you're stuck on the left and you'retrying to do what they want you to dostow their views and their opinions andtheir way of life on you so I guess if Iever were to make more videos out ofthis you know I can talk about differentpilot about politics we all watch thenews I don't know what's going on youknow but can we really listen andbelieve much of the news anymore so youknow maybe I'll talk more about otherthings going on I never thought aboutdoing a YouTube channel or a videochannel before I don't do much ofFacebook I have one but I don't do muchwith it I don't do snapchat or Twitteror any of that nonsenseI always try to stay a littlebut I've seen all these people talkabout politics and you know their viewsand how they support the walk awaymovement and I thought well hell I coulddo that he was talk about what's on mymind you know I don't want to tellpeople what they should or shouldn't door what I think they should or should door believe in or say or what theiropinion should be and they're reallybeen about that I guess what I wouldlike I guess coming from me is you knowmaybe expose people a different side ofthinking a different way of thinking Inever try to get anybody to switch theirbeliefs or turn against what theybelieve inI don't believe in that I would not tellanybody to vote we vote for this side orvote for that side or no no you know yougot to do what you think is right votefor who you want to vote for even ifit's not who I would go forsois my first video I've ever made soexcuse me for being maybe a littlenervous I'm driving my car right now butI'm not really good at speaking in frontof the camera especially when I'mlooking at myself normally I could speakin front of a group of people that'd befine because I can do betterinteractions with them but I just wantedto give a walk away video and tell abouthow I left the left and I guess move thelittle right to the centerhow I don't how I don't really it's poorpretty much any democratic politiciananymore I mean I live in the Midwest Ihave for pretty much all my life and Iwill say there is a big differencebetween a Midwestern Democrat and aCalifornia Democrat or a New YorkDemocrat but you are we really foolingthat's like saying oh uh well like aMidwestern Republican is the same as asouthern Republican not quite so muchbutI appreciate what brandon has done Ibelieve in what he's doing all theothers that have made videos I'vewatched a lot of you there's there'sprobably hundreds out there I heard whaty'all said I appreciate it I believe init I am for it and if anybody out thereknows people who are thinking of walkingaway or thinking of making a video forthe walk away movement I would encourageyou to do that you know I think this isa this is an eye-opener for many peoplewho feel abandoned betrayed and used bythe left and I believe that in theupcoming election in about a 1 year fromnow and let's face it pretty much oncethe holidays is over it's gonna be backto politics 24/7 on TV and radio andinternet you know it's coming so I thinkthis movement and others like it aregoing to play a big role in the upcomingelection who's gonna run against TrumpI don't know will Trump win I believe soI don't see a problembut I think with movies like these thatwill definitely help so I believe whatBrandon is doing I hope he continues todo what he does all of you out there Ifeel the same way you watch my video youknow thank youI'm not making this for you no for moneyor for attention or if I do decide tomake a channel to talk about stuff likethis I'm not really doing it for money Iguess I just want to you know talk aboutwhat I think is going on my opinions myviews you know what I see going on in myarea at the country where I live at myhome and you don't gotta talk about partof the time we all like other thingsbesides politics we all follow otherthings you know so um that's pretty muchmy video of why I walked away from theleft and why I'm done with them and howI don't think I can ever vote for aDemocrat person againso I appreciate it thank you[Music]
what's good everybodyi'm uh going against the grain todaythere may be some noises in thebackgroundwhich is intentional normally i don't doit with noises but it's very intentionaltoday because umi'm actually doing a walk away video umbuteven though i walked away like 10 yearsagoum you know the importance of me doing awalk awayum is just becauseyou know i grew up like most stories youhear from you know african americans isthatum you know they grew up in a householdthat was you know typically democratand um they typically ask how theyshould voteand you know either a parent or so tellthem to you know go down a list andjust mark everything democrat you knowso umgenerally most times i'm not saying i'mnot speaking for everyafrican-americanin life but um most of timesyou're just given the ultimatum tochoose and you're notreally taught policy because the sadpart is is thata lot of people don't even understandpolicy they'll even say nowadays thatpolicy is not even important and ifthat's the case then we might as wellnot even voteif it's not about policy but i hear alot of you knowby people saying it's not importantmoving alongum you know eventuallyi got grown and followed theleader and um was just votingdemocratic not caring how not caringabout the repercussions not worryingaboutyou know the um conditions andeverything thatwe continue to go through as blackpeople and umyou know when you get older and you havekids and you knowhonestly for me um becoming a christianhad changed everything because then itbecame more about valuesand so you know i wanted to look in thelens of like what godwould um uphold righteous or notand um you know so i that's when reallywhen i gotinterested in policies and other thingsyou know umyou know but as far as policies lookingat god it's like wellyou know when we look at abortion i knowthat god is not for thatum you know we look atyou know other things are just morallyinside honestly just common sense youknowthe democratic party started slavery youknow they wanted to uphold slaveryum you know and it's just been a lot ofliesand up to this point it's just now it'sjust blatant lies and they don't eventry to hide no more likeit used to be i guess if i could saysomewhat decency in the party in a partyor a hidden decency should i saybut nowadays it's not even that it'sjust you're cut you're just gettingthese satanicvibes and that's just what it is and noone tries to hide from itno one's trying to run from it oranything it's just this is what it isand accept ityou know and you're at a point now whereyou gotta choose the sideand that's fine you know what i'm sayingjust as long as you choose the rightsideyou know as long as you educate and doyour thing you knowi'm a different type of conservativebecause i'm from the streetyou know and um really really been onthe streetyou know umso it was different for meyou know but at the same time like i wasvery versatile likei've had jobs and things like that tooand i had to deal withyou know people and you know not allgroups of people you know i come from asmall place andi was in sales for a long time as wellandthe money i had to make was really to behonest with you mostly all for whitepeopleand so i realized at that pointlike it really wasn't about umyou trying to be like someone butmore of using your swagyour umurgency sense of urgency your skill setin order to get people to conform to youyou know to build your time valuableso people don't take advantage of yourtimeyou know it's really just about you it'sabout your self-preservationabout you being able to build yourselfupand people respecting you and respectingyour timeand respecting your craft respectingwhat you doso you become valuable to yourself andeveryone else around youyou know so um i realized likei became really good at thatand very successful earlyand so from my from that point becauseyou know sometimes inyou know growing up we're taught blackpeople are taught you know thatthe white man is against you and yeahyeah yeah this and thatyou know and that you can it's hard tomake it and this and thatwhen actually in my own reality and ittook me a while to realize thatthat it wasn't you know it was all aboutme it was about my choicesit was about um my determinationyou know and it was about what i wantedto achieveand not letting anything get in the wayof achieving thati did this video straight through likethis becausei'm open to distractions i'm at home myfamily's here right nowyou know i got kids doing online schooland things like thatum even though i'm not even gettingdistractions right now but i kept itopen for that becausethe reason it's so important is that youhave to learn how to deal withdistractions in your lifeyou can't just let a distraction comeand then stop you have to learn how todeal with it and keep goingand actually making it a part of yourpresentation evenyou know so um i know i'm kind oframbling about this and i only want tomake thislaw but um you know somorally is why i moved away um from thedemocratic partyum i seen that they're becoming moreevil in a satanic spirit senseum i see thatum there's not really much tolerancefrom the side i see that they're playingrace-baiting games and i'm just not withnone of that you know like especiallylike i said with beingborn again in a christian like you knowwe're all part of justone human race and that's what it is youknow so no one's oppressedno one's this and that it's all aboutchoicesyou know um the choices you make arewill pretty much be the consequencesthat you will have to deal with in lifeso umyou know um and i got to you know andthen justtaking the time to realize that umwhen i opened up because that's thebiggest thing too you have to beopen-mindedand um you know once i started doing myresearch inthe republican party because i was likeman i can't even seedoing this but then i you know got tolooking at the partyand doing my own research and seeingthat really mostblacks are conservative their values areconservativeum and they don't even know what that'sthe sad part they're running around andthey don't even know that they'reconservativeyou know um and that this wholeracism thing that we're living off ofhas been taughtit's you know and if you're taughtsomething long enough every single dayby the sources that you have availableto youwhich is media um you knowmusic whatever you know there's alltypes of different entertainmentum you can end up believing a lie andthat's what it isis that you know you getyou end up being at 85 percent of peoplewhobelieve the lie and soyou know i'm not better than anyonebut i'm smarter than thatand so um yeah so i'm not going toramble on in this and that you knowum there also are consequences andwalking away too you know i tookthose hits too you know i've lost um youknowmy mom i lost uh family membersuh your relationships don't stay thesame people you grew up withum they look at you different you knowbecause you haveyou know in a sense self-educatedyourselfabout um right or wrongand so um there's a lot you go throughyou know like um i stand on the frontlines a lot protectingum conservative values and uhpeople don't respect it at all evenchristians you know i'm saying likechristians evenlook down on it you know and umit's weird coming from that side toobecause you'll think that they'll be thefirst ones to understandso um you know i'm just open-minded manumyou know i'm i'm proud to have taken thelosses i've takenum i'm proud to be standing on the rightsidewhich is on god's side because you knowit's funnywhen i was running with the devil andletting the devil infiltratei was good i was cool you know peoplewould stand up for me ratherwrong or right but when you want tostand up for something righteousman you don't get that same kind of loveyou knowum it's funny because you know i'ma christian but like i'm still from thestreets so like my mentalityis really still the same you know i justdo difference i just don't do the samethingsyou know um i strive on livingrighteouslyyou know i strive onyou know hand hand ups and not handoutsyou know um i strive on i canmentality you know there's nothing ican't doyou know the word can't has to be justtotally erasedso um you know i also have a channelit's called uhfees chh playlistum you know i've talked about thesethings in the pastum you know i also have segments whereit plays nothing but um christianhip-hopmusic and then i do my own dialoguetalking about these issues we're talkingabout right nowlike i said formally i'm just doing aofficialwalk away um videoyou know and um it's just it's just beena long time comingyou know but um yeah you know there'sfreedomin this you know there's um liberationthrough thisyou know uh there's victory through thisand you knowit may not be the most popular thing todobut it's the right more it's the mostrighteous thing to do hey i got homiesthattalk about you know man when i look atthe values of the policies of therepublicans man it actually really doesline upwith god but you know i just can't man iain't feeling trump i can't do this ican't do thatand it's like but so you know a lot oftimes people get caught up withyou know the personality of the personversuswhat the person is doing andon the reverse side of that if a personknows how to talk wellum or can like at least front in frontof youas if they talk well and they're doingthe right thingsthen they'll get to nod up even thoughthat they're not giving you any policiesyou know um or their policies are totearyour country down you know to usher in anewa one world government umand things are such you know there's somuch i can go into that i'm not goingintoum i suggest that you follow these chhplaylistson youtube um because i dothis type of uh contentum my biggest thing right now is dealingwith the elephant in the room becausein order for us to change we gotta dealwith deep-rooted issuesthat um are uncomfortable to deal withpublicly and um salute to everyone thatdoeshas done a uh we've had the heartto do a walk away videoand um we look all we lookwe look different we look a wholeindifferentour appearance looks different there'sso many uhconservatives now forgive me forsomething over thatbut there's so many different types ofconservatives nowthat um it's beautifulbecause people are waking up you knowblack people are waking upum latinos are waking up umyou know africans are waking up umasians are waking up you know there's somany differentgroups of people i see that are wakingupyou know especially for people who wereimmigrant you knowimmigrants who moved here legally andthey moved away fromsocialist ideas to get here to a countrylike this where there's freedomyou know because they actually know whatcommunism looks likeand they know what socialism looks likeand they don't want to bethey don't want to have any parts to dowith that they came here to get awayfrom thatyou know in the meantime this country istrying to push itthese people came here to get away fromthat so people are waking up and they'relike nah this ain'twhat we came here for you know um it'sreally a lot of common sense policiesthat people don't look at because like isaid like people say that policiesaren't important nowyou know because they're so drawn intonarrativesyou know that got them emotionallydrawn in that they really don't believein but they've been forced to believe initso i think i'm gonna leave it rightthere umyou know i consider myself a hood streetconservativeyou know i am christian umyou know but when i described otherthings it just describes where i comefromum the background of my lifeum what i know because you know a lot ofconservatives are you know the peoplelook at them as softand um it ain't that kind of party overhereyou know um we're more intelligent hoodyou know individuals who havetaken our time toresearch study and honestlyjust make a well-informed decisionsabout to differ between right and wrongso um i thank you guys fortuning in once again subscribeum hit the likes share umvisit my youtube which is vschh playlistum thank you i love youum i see you guys in the futurein

hi my name is ava greetings from Iraq Iam a professor and a researcher andwriter who presently lives in KurdistanIraq my husband is Kurdish and I wish tosay I am happy when that I have chosenin my life to walk away from theDemocratic Party my at my path to goingtowards the Republican Party were wasdue to multiple reasons number one I didnot rubber boat for President Obama andwhen I chose not to vote for PresidentObama I witnessed how many Democrats inthe Washington DC area would tend it tocall people like me Uncle Tom's traitorsto our race etc I might not be traitorto anyone and as a matter of fact I grewup and in college witnessing andspeaking to and listening to thoseveterans of the civil rights movementsome who would actually agree with manyelements of today's modern conservativeparty but the primary thing that reallydisturbs me from afar is when I seeleftist extremists ridiculing cuttingdown their family members putting downtheir friends that is not something thatis good we as Americans are better thanthat and we should be better than thatwe should agree to disagreebut sadly particularly when I lived inthe state of Washington and was doingresearch thereI witnessed many leftist extremists whowere ridiculing people who chose to beRepublicansI witnessed some of them standing inhighways to keep people from going toDonald Trump's rally and I asked myselfwhat is the problem here I witnessed onthe Westcause many instances of politicians withleftist leanings who were not helpingtheir communities with homelessness orwith the problems of illegal immigrationI support immigration but I supporttheir being rules and there needs to berulesI would undercover as a researcherwitnessing how there were problems withillegal immigrants coming up from Mexicowho were selling drugs drug usage is abig problem big problem and if we lookat the state of Washington that is anultra huge problemthe idea of sanctuary cities has nothelped anyone indeed there were two orthree Mexican drug lords former Mexicandrug lords who had told me how they feltthat Donald Trump was correct that thereare problems coming up from Mexico whena former drug lord or someone who waspreviously in the drug industry istelling you that then you know peopleshould be listening but instead thereare many who choose to mock theRepublican Party for bringing up theseissues there are far too many who wishto call them races and I feel this isone of the number one reasons whyprogress has not been made in thearena's of drug dealers etc is due tothese extreme leftist leanings and ithas got to stop and therefore I am sohappy to be able to say I am a proudRepublican I am very very proud to beoneI am moderate and I would encourage allminorities and people to not let yourfamily make you feel guilty for

everybody is bishop here and I know I'ma little late to the party I mean I knewabout this movement when it started anddoing other things as far as working notwell the channel and and you know don'tknow cream video content for MotherChallenge doctor but this this issomething I think I want to put my twocents in worth or actually it's a littlebit more than that because I'm explainedon my end where my walkaway momentstarted and mind it actually dates itactually dates back to way back in sixthgrade for me now mind you I've been outof school for thirty yearsso this goes way back and it's it openedmy eye to seeingthe mindset should say theindoctrination or whatever we willing tocall it back then dates back even thatfar and here's my story and and this isthe only store because there's a fewthings I remember about six great thingsof school and everything and what Ididn't it's not a few memories about itbut this memory here this memory sticksout to me the most enough carry it withme for forty years more and neverunderstood why but this was an incidentback in sixth grade where it was rightaround election time and this is whereum Jimmy Carr Jimmy Carter and RonaldReaganthey're running okay and this is uh whencard was elected so what we had wasgoing on was a class project that wasbasically like a collection so it wasteaching us as far as the voting processat a sixth grade level you know they getus participated in and understand whatit's about so the curriculum was of whatshe had laid out was different thingsabout you know whatever it was aboutJimmy Carter and then what he stood forand what he was about and everythinglike that as far as the Democrat andanother side the Republican side ofRonald Reagan what he stood for and andwas it he were about and we had to makea vote way to vote for you know whowould be present who would you choose tobe President okay so this was uh thiswas carried out from ok my main teacherthen but she wasn't there that day whenit was it was a substitute teacheractually not still until this day Icouldn't remember her name but she wouldhad lesson to carry out that lesson forthe day soyou know we've all went through itthrough the whole class now money thisis just an individual that this is no noindictment on my school because I lovemy high school truly do you know so it'snot that it was just on this individualbut you know we went through the processand looked and everything and everybodyvoted for who they wanted to and then Ivoted for Reagan so when she wentthrough all the votes and everything andlooked at who voted for what and had adiscussion over and then she looked atmineand then because we had to name it awayto write our names on him you know soshe know whose paper it was if shelooked at mine and saw my vote was forReagan and later to the class she pulledme off to the side and she asked me saidhoney why did you vote for Reagan and meI'm sixth grade and I said I can readyou know and I read what you wrote forher down for drink and then I read whatyou wrote down for Ronald Reagan andsomewhere along line I just reallydidn't agree with Jimmy CarterI agreed more with Ronald Reagan on theRepublican side and she looked at myother side just I said I like RonaldReagan so I didn't break it down likethat but I told her I said I'd likeRonald Reagan I liked what you were ohboy it was two floors so I like him andshe goes oh honey that's not and that'snot really good I'm looking at herconfused on what we mean and I asked herI said why not and she goeskid you not I kid you not she goeshunting he's a Republican and they don'treally do anything to help your peopleand I'm standing there at sixth gradeand I'm looking at this woman going whatlike what the hell are you talking aboutdo you mean you people have it confusedme confuse me I'm making this up I swearcarried this for for over 40 years atthe start and I'm still I'm still dyingevery once in a while we talk about theelection process anything else and thatvision that flashed that moment flashesthrough my head still this isn't a dreamso I'm like what do you mean I'm sittingthere confused going I don't know so Ilet it go I mean I'm just praying I'mstill you know I'm young and confusedeven then so I let it go you know Ididn't think of anything else about itso not also of course as you know youknow coming up to the black family youknow hard-working blue-collar family youknow my family basically voted Democratright down the line and you know Ialways kind of you know went with thefamily thing and trying to understand itone way and thought it was this way soyeah I voted Democrat for longest timethen my walk my wake-up moment was whenBill Clinton got elected re-elected andit was right after he got reelectedthere was a school shooting in Kentuckyand I think there was a quick interviewthat he did it was real flashes like areporter just you know basically askedsome question was just a flash you knowhe'd given a comment about it orsomething and when he said and I kid younot he said something his interviewwhere he said well this means we have tohave stricter gun control lawssomething how he said that and what hesaid man it went off literally it wentoff in my head like a light and I'mgoing what what waiting wait a minutewhat do you mean stricter gun controllaws it's like you've been talking aboutgun control laws for years and years yetyou still see that any criminal anybodywho's got will you know evil intentionin their heart they're gonna carry itout no matter what they're still gonnaget the hands on a gun okay I knew thisI knew this years even as a young kidand then I look back on that and I don'tunderstand why that just went off in myhead I can't Eve I still to this daycan't figure out what was that totrigger the light and make it go off andgo man I got to rethink this whole thingI got to look back on this same becausewhat I was taught you know to believe ofwhat the Democrat Party was what theystood for and now I got real curious Igot more curious and then I had like Isaid from that moment I flashed backagain back to sixth grade and I'm likewait a minute man this this this thinghad not to me this is not adding up tome at all what the hell so I starteddigging more I started looking athistory more and digging into a deeperand deeper and deeper and really startedlooking at this and one man the more Ifound out the more I got pissed the moreI got upset and the more I kept goingyou have got to be kidding me I said andI look back now from that point up andall the way up till now I'm just flatout going men Democrat I'm sorry--butbeen snakes foreverthey have been lowdown snakes for everespecially against minorities especiallyagainst minorities people color blackfolks the Democrat Party I promise youis not your friendthey are not your friend at all theyhave done everything man from fightingfor slaverywhich come on admit it even with that'swhat the Civil War was even about okaythat's exactly what it was it's whyLincoln called it out and said look thisis this is war actually about slaveryokay just a minute let's just put it outthere all right fought for slavery bossthat then came along with the Jim Crowlaws in the southokay basically to desecrate even morethan just diminished in more black punkfolks okayso then they had that they created theKlan because when they couldn't keep youas a slave anymore then you were stillfighting against the Jim Crow laws theystill had to figure out some way tomuscle you and the fear and the feartaxes keep booting mixed so they createda claim - all right then go from thatsame hold Klan didn't work so what elsewas unless what's the last thing becauseblack people were getting more educatedthey were getting higher up you know inin political offices you know this iseverything else we and blacks werecreating they're learning how to createtheir own wealth they were prosperingokay what else was there the last-ditcheffort well we couldn't do any all thatso then we had to control you withpolicy till this day it still goes onnow till this day this is all stuffgreat by the Clinton abided by theDemocratic Party all of this okay we'regonna part it it seriously voted againstcivil rightsit took Republicans to pass it theRepublican Party was started by freedslaves and abolitionists rightso with that being said it just itamazes me that black people still havenot woken up to the fact and stillbuying into the fear-mongering stillbuying into the hatred the party oftolerance in my ass because it'shonestly the party that's constantlydoing things that are against blackfolks I mean voting for the simple factof abortion and proving and andbasically glorifying Planned Parenthoodglorifying a woman Margaret Sanger itamazes me it amazed Democrats just upand down jump forward and everybody elseyou know own black people do jump foreverybody elseyou don't gotta have Planned ParenthoodMargaret Sanger created PlannedParenthood for the sole purpose for thetrue sole purpose of genocide of theblack race that she did it for but sheput it under the guise of you knowwomen's health and all this condemnedget out of my face with that crap anywhat it is look to me look through linelook between the lines of BS and you seeyou see what it's aboutso it's just in it it infuriates me somuch it infuriates me so much every timewhen I hear the BS lines that come outwith the victimhood talityfear-mongering tactics everything elsethat come out with that come fromDemocrats it drives me nuts as to whereas a conservative that and when Irealized all of this before I wonder Irealized that you know what I've been aconservative my entire life because Ibelieve in God I believe in family Ibelieve in my country I believe thefreedom of possibility of liberty andthe pursuit of happiness and all of thatbecause it was created that way okayand it was for equality when MartinLuther King told you said you know Idon't judge people by the conduct by thethe color of the skin but the content ofthe character I said that's how I'velived my entire life now mine I went toan all-white school all-white schoolokay so don't let it fool you I stillhave family I still I'm very close to myfamily so that didn't go to my school soI see it on both sidesso my experience made a little bit ofdifferent than most or then some but thesimple fact is I've never forgot any ofthis stuff you know like I said all yougot to do is do your homework people doyour homeworkwake up it's there and it's crazybecause the left is desperately tryingto erase the history of the left becausethe left has got such a big black markon American history very bad black markon American history so and they're trulytrying to erase it truly trying to denyit especially trying to erase blackhistory okayand if you think I'm lying about thattake a good look at Woodrow Wilson youcan start right there I do believe thatWoodrow Wilson was the first one toimplement as far in the the educationalsystem not the educational system butgetting the government involved ineducationhe is also responsible to putting itbasically a bug a directive as far asdismissing any kind of black historythat contributed to this country okayanything positive put it that wayand it's been systematic we've beengoing on since then I'm incorrect thereused to be a civics class back in the60s savings basically they taught youthe Constitution Bill of Rightseverything I mean hell did the patrioticcourse and then my mom told me about itwhen she was in school all of a suddenthat disappeared disappeared in the 60sand it was like required reading somecrying required study don't see that himwhy I guess you know if you keep youdumb you don't know anything about theBill of Rights and actually know yourconstitutional rights you really don'tknow how to even fight a defendant ifyou don't know about it so all I'msaying is you know I can sit here andramble about this stuff I can rambleabout this stuff all all day long youknow I got good friends of mine allcolors we all get together we talk aboutthis stuff I got friends minorconservatives and some of the LiberalDemocrats we all have a goodconversation about this you know and andthat's what people need to do we need totalk we need to have a true honestconversationnot hurling did Roger Tory comments oranything else is demeaning anybody I'mjust saying just learn the historylearning history and find out what iswhat black people learn the historyyou'd be surprised what you find you'dbe surprised at how long we've been liedtohe'll be surprised all you got to do isdig it don't take long it doesn't takelong to find out just do it ok butanyway guys this is that's mine I'vebeen I've been dying to say this andjust I just want to put this on videoyou know if you like you like you don'tyou don't I don't care but it's justsomething I had to get out I had to getout and say something about it so youunderstand where I come from not a manabout victimhood I've never played thatbecause I was never taught that and I'mtalking about my parents andgrandparents and my grandparents whocame from Mississippi the deep southduring this turmoilokay during holidays crap so they toldme first hand that's where I got a lotinformation from some of this firsthandfrom them God rest his soulboth of soul they say something here saymy family go through this I'm sure theblack folks have family from the southand Alabama Georgia miss especiallyMississippi sure you've got stories tooabout this so pay attention to what'sgoing on understand what party is forwhat and and I'm not saying a supportpartyI'm just saying support your principlesif you know what your principles arethat's what you support because that'swhat I support I

what is up Instagram YouTube whereveryou're watching this from I just want tomake this video real quick I made videosbefore about my political views but Ifeel like I want to reiterate because ofa movement that struck the internetwaves called the walk away movementwhere people are talking about why theyleft the Liberal Democratic Partywhatever you want to call it um I wasraised a Democrat I was raised tobelieve that you know Republicansconservatives who are old-schoolright-wing racists who wanted to keepAmerica like the 1940s or the slaverytimes you know I was brought todifferent political events as a kid nowall that kind of stuff I was actually atObama's very first inauguration I wasthere in the audience I was in eighthgrade and when he got elected I was inmiddle school thirteen years old so yeahI went to his second inauguration but Istayed in the hotel because it was waytoo cold and I was like I'm not doingthis again so I stayed in the hotel withmy brother other people that I was withattended the inauguration I campaignedfor Obama I can campaign for otherDemocratic politicians without everlooking at them or their track record Ijust believed that oh I'm black sotherefore I should you know be aDemocrat because black people areDemocrats white people are racist whitepeople in particular are Republicanswhatever whatever but later on I foundout about things like the Illuminati theshadow government whatever you want tocall it and the more I got into JesusChrist I noticed that my political mylife views were more so in tune withthings that people would call moreconservative and I remember back in whenI was growing up when you would callsomebody conservative it didn't mean apolitical party it meant that they weremore you know reserved about theirlifestyle and their choices and all thatkind of stuff so if somebody didn'tdrink or they weren't promiscuous a oryou promiscuous you would say oh she's aconservative girl you know but sorryguys later on it was really during thetwentyseen election cycle where I saw howmalicious the the left was being likeeverybody love Donald Trump black peopleincluded he was an idol to a lot ofblack people rappers would make songsabout him rappers and all differenttypes of people would hang out with himeverybody loved Donald Trump until hebecame a candidate for the 2016 electioncycle we're not running as a Democratthen everybody said he was a racist hewas so sexist he did this and this andthis and that and everybody was comingout of the Woodworks with an evil storyto tell when just like a couple yearsbefore people were making songs like uplike Trump and like my Donald Trumpmoney and all of that kind of stuff so Iwas on social media and this was thevery first time that I was able to votein a presidential election and I Icouldn't vote for Hillary I justcouldn't I couldn't vote for it becauseI really researched her research herhistory research the type of person thatshe was and my better conscience iswould not let me vote for Hillary Icouldn't do it so I did vote for ourcurrent president and I will vote forhim again in 2020 and just seeing howthe left has become or is extremelydehumanizing they are not into logicit's all the body or emotions it's allaboutI feel like this so therefore it's factand when you try to hit them with thefacts even basic facts like the historyof their own party like how MargaretSanger who started Planned Parenthoodwas actually a member of the KKK shespoke to women in the KKK and said wedon't want word to go out that weactually are trying to exterminate theNegro race she wasn't even excited blackwomen which she did giving black womenhysterectomies and Hillary Clinton saidthe Margaret Sanger is her idol and alsothings like the Clintons and Haiti andall of these different types of thingsand just how if you are not a Democratyou are just evil you're a Nazi you arethis you are that it's just dehumanizingabortion you know even how the Democratsactuallythe slaves and you can't tell peoplethat because they just don't believe youbut and they like I said founded the KuKlux Klan and all of these differentthings so I got off the Democratplantation and I noticed that you knowthere's a quote that says if you do thesame thing over and over and expect thesame different results that's insanityso voting for these Democrats over andover and over and over and they're doingnothing for inner cities they're doingnothing for black people they're doingnothing except turning right around youknow Maxine Waters her district inCalifornia that she's been elected in torun for so many years it's like thepoorest County or the poorest districtin California it looks like a tornadojust ran through the place like Iliterally saw a video of it the otherday and I was just in shock because whatis she doing she shouldn't be runningaround telling people to her trumpsupporter she should go and fix whatshe's supposed to fix but she's not soyeah guys I just wanted to talk aboutthe walkaway movement why I personallywalked away I don't see myself everreturning to the Democrat Party um soyeah that's that's just I just wanted tosay that if you think that you know yourfeelings towards me change it doesn'tmatter I don't really care but I'm not ahateful person I don't hate anybody Idon't hate anyone because they're gay orthey're whatever I anything like thatlike I literally love everybody umthat's just my political views like justthat I'm not a Democrat I just I'm notso yeah I hope you guys have a great dayI just want to explain that and justmake this little video and say that yoif you want to walk away don't be afraiddon't be ashamed people are gonna saywhatever they want regardless and don'tlet anybody stereotype you just becauseyou're black just because you're gayjust because you're whatever doesn'tmean that you can be a free thinker likemy boy Kanye West said and Candace Owensand ya guysstay strong and stay awesome I love youguys regardless of what you think orwhat you believe and God loves you tooso yeah it doesn't matter God is abovepolitics and no matter who's thepresident Jesus is the king of kingsanyway so it's all good anyways y'allhave a great one stay awesome peace
first let me say that I really love thiswebsite or this Facebook page and I'vewatched a lot of the videos of you folksthat have walked away and I'm so proudof you and it's so encouraging to mejust see people waking up I woke up along long time ago I was born in 1965and South Mississippi in a verytumultuous time my fat mouth I was borninto a Dixiecrat family everybody in myfamily was Democrat and my father waskind of like a James Carville of thesixties he I would come home from schooland he'd mark marks me into the livingroom and he'd say bill this is senatorso-and-so and governor so-and-so andrepresentative so-and-so from alldifferent states in my living room and Igrew up around this and at the time itmade me anti-political I guess becauseat that young age they would be sittingaround asking my dad for strategies bothRepublican and Democrat on how to getsomething done that they both wanteddone and my dad would tell thembasically from a Democratic point ofview this is how you go about explainingit to your constituents and then on theRepublican side you do it this way andthese guys got along great in the livingroom and would invite each other overfor dinner to play golf or whatever andthe next day I'd see them on the newsand they'd be ripping each other apartmy family I'm a direct descendant ofJames Madison and my fourthgreat-grandfather was gentl'man Lenoirof Lenoir North Carolina he was aRevolutionary War general and notbeen in this country since itsconception but they were all Democratsluckily my parents never taught me tohate anybody and back then of course onthe Democrat side it was all KKK youknow white supremists keeping the blackpeople down and my parents never taughtme that my father to his credit it was awonderful man but he always told me torespect everybody 100% and let themdetermine how much respect there doob healso said that if he wanted to know ifyou could trust somebody then trust themand they'll let you know how much trustthey're worthy of but he always taughtme to respect everybody but when Istarted school it was the second year ofintegration in South Mississippi and Ihad this wonderful homeroom teacher missmiss Maclaurin that was her name acolored lady and she was sweet as shecould be to me I loved her to death Ihave actually got in some of my files alittle notes I wrote her when I was akid we had a maid that raised me justlike the helps in the movie the help butbut my parents loved her my family lovedher and I certainly loved her becauseshe was like a mother to me so I I wasnever taught to hate anybody in a racistracist type way but as I got older I sawthe Democratic Party for what it was theelite part of it and I didn't want tohave anything to do with thatbecause I had I was going to school withblack children and they were my friendsand I loved themI still do I have great friends todaythat I went to school with I mean fromfirst grade andso I was the weird liberal Republicankid back in the 60s I find it difficultnow because now I'm because I'm aRepublican I'm a racist but I guessthat's what I'm trying to saybut they've confounded everything andmixed everything up so bad that nobodynobody knows what anybody is anymorethey've just turned the tables aroundanyway I I just I guess I just wanted totell this little story because of what Iwent throughfirst let me say that I

anymorethey've just turned the tables aroundanyway I I just I guess I just wanted totell this little story because of what Iwent through
what's going on everybody we're backhere in another video now I want to makethis video for the hashtag walkawaymovement that's going on I have onlyseen a few hashtags I've heard peopletalking about it I watched a few videosand I could pretty much guess what it isso I'm gonna watch a lot of people'spersonal stories and stuff you know aswe you know as I finish this videobecause I want to kind of just you knowsay this is like my initial reactionit's kind of like you know there was allthese people who didn't have a way tolike signify that they feltuncomfortable being told how to be orhow to act or you're going to be thisway you know it's like the Twitter Imean since it's Twitter and they haveelectronics and you have the internetinstead of people showing up at yourdoor they just show up in your commentsection for everyone to see like in apublic forum and say you better likethis you better be that you better bethis because you you're gay you're blackyou're white you're Chinese you betterfit into your placethat's equality we come and tell youwhere you you know were you effingbelong you disgusting worm and like Isaid we all know who these people areand you know the walk away movement Iguess it's kind of like I kind oftribute the hashtag actually likeworking now to like the when they whenthey came up when they coined the termfake news you know what I mean becausethere was like the lying media there wasa psychic on you know in fours I guesshad a had a contest I remember watchingand they were trying to trying to getthe perfect name or hashtag for what tocall all the major news networks thatyou know or publications you know art ofyou know colonists you know art articlesor whatever that you know that happenedto be you know just writing that youknow straight up lies or you know liesmixing with truths or trying toessentially guilt trip you and just likehow you better believe this otherwisewe're gonna basically get you killedlike we're gonna get your family messedup and it's like like a bunch of peopleroll up into your town with a bunch offlags and chefs puffed out like allpompous like we are the most virtuousanybody who doesn't sayor do anything we tell them to do youwill die we'd be killed and you know whoand they have like the Twitter mobs andit's essentially like they couldn'tmuster enough people that would actuallywalk you know behind them withoutactually being tricked or know anythingbecause every you know obviouslyeverybody's either you know not informedor they just tricked them or they'rejust straight up and like you knowthey're just like literally straight upjust what's the word I'm looking forbasically when people know you have youknow ill intent and you're you know youreally want to do harm even thoughyou're lying and say no we're not herewe're here to you know fight for onesfreedoms and if you don't listen to whatI think I'm gonna hit you because we'reall wearing all black and we're in ahuge mob so they finally you know I wason a walk here they got a hash tag thatworked it's hash tag walk away andthat's what this video is about and oneof the other videos I watched was a guyjust with the black background you knowjust talking and I'm assuming he was gaybut I mean he ended up saying that intwo videos I mean because he was likehey I mean obviously he's making thevideo because he was really stressed outand angry and I mean I guess it had tobe him I had to be someone like himbecause you know somebody like anybodyelse you know obviously they're not theperson who's up on the banner for youknow I guess it would be all thediversity types of movements he's notmuch diverse it says everybody thinksthe same they just looked different Imean that's not really that's not reallydiverse you know what I mean it's justnot this is mean you know you're justgonna force people like it's almost likebasically if they had you know thesoviet union that had hitler in the headthey studied all those people andthey're like what did they do wrong ohwhen they were killing all those peoplethey didn't have colorful and funny likefunny colored hair not that that's youknow wrong or anything but they usedthat as a cover so that you won't thinkthat they're hurting you or making youdo things that are hindering yoursuccess or are you know actually givingyou brain damage like mentally damagingyou you know there's a lady who pouredbleach or Drano in her eye because shewanted to be oppressed I mean look whatthey're doing to these people this isnot how you doingit's not okay you know what I mean andit's really sad that it had to comethis but I mean I guess I guess it didso they have the hashtag walkawaymovement and the guy was talking abouthow you know there is all thesedifferent types of people who aresupposedly you know supposed to be youknow cheering for you know certainindividuals of the Democratic NationalCommittee or any other political groupthey just retired of it you know they'rejust tired of you know you're supposedto be you're supposed to be socialistbecause you're brown you should lovethis you should love that you know whatI mean and it's like but but theirideology is not socialism how come theyget to have all this stuff but I have tohave this you know and it's like peopledon't it's not fair for them and they'rejust they're starting to finally figureit out like maybe they weren't evenpolitical at all because like I wastelling somebody the other day I was onthe uber guy livestream and people weresaying that you know it was half thecountry because everybody likes to sayoh it's half the country fifty-fiftyit's not it's really notthere was like 50 55 or not 56 millionpeople voted for Hillary 56 million orso people voted for Donald Trump becausethey had all the illegal votes and allthis stuff so I'm not gonna get into thebreakdown of what her actual vote countwas as we know but you know it was onlya hundred and twelve 110 million now allthe people that voted there's like threehundred and thirty million people inthis country so only a third of thecountry voted so people say oh it's50/50 people I know it might be 5050people you ask you don't you're notwalking around to all the cities talkingall the people you're there looking theyusually get people at political eventsthat they show up to specifically voicetheir opinion are totally see what'sgoing on because they know of it and soyou still haven't gotten all the otherpeople know maybe they had an opinionand they just didn't vote but I meanthat's a different story it's like Isaid only a third of the people in thecountry voted in the election so like Isaid this time is gonna be a lotdifferent and especially when you'rerunning around beating people up tellingthem you better it's like the mobessentially it's like the feeling drivenmob it's like like I was saying earlierthey found out what Hitler and all theseother horrible dictators like you knowstyle and random people in Asia orAfrica they're just warlords it's likewell what if we dressed them nice andthey were like really into music and hipstuff so that like whenever you're likehey are you like you know come out withgenocide playing oh Jenny from the blockoh and people like oh you're not killingme yeah that's cool they're just stupidyou know what I mean and like and thenit's like almost like Mars Attacks whereyou're or even if they you know pullsome propaganda stuff on you and you'relike not falling for it like how dareyou not fall for the propaganda and atthis point you're just like I mean youjust go have to start swinging onbecause like what are you what do youget like so ivory quality you have to doit like okay no that's what it is hashthey walk away when people are tired cuzlike I said what about like okay whatabout people who were abused as kids andthey grew up being different thaneverybody else and they already feelabused and used and like a lot of peoplereally had messed-up lives and you knowit's kind of messed up that they'll sayoh well I'm super super you knowdiversity feeling and driven and ifyou're not with me you must be a bigothe must be this or that which is kind offunny because that's the that's theexact opposite of a big is somebodywhose wants to think and do their ownthing and you know is willing to hearwhat other people have to say butthey're not willing to hear it otherpeople have to say so they're like ohyou better do what I say otherwiseyou're not considered this you're abigot like no you you're the definitionof a bigot like that's unbelievable it'slike I was sayinghashtag walk away movement like you'rejust rubbing people the wrong way andthen like they're intentionally seekingpeople attacking them and rubbing themthe wrong way on purpose it's justreally it's kind of embarrassing towatch you know like I said I was neverlike I was never like fooled by theirpropaganda even as a child I alreadyknew that you know the government didn'tthe politicians didn't run anything itwas all military or you know there wasother people I mean he you always knewlike I said I didn't grow up watchingpoliticians or live group watching likeyou know documentaries and you knowscary stuff so I mean even to me itwould just be like you know that doesn'tmake sense for like oh we're gonna votefor this one guy and is a child I'd belikethere's still too much stuff going onfor that one guy he couldn't even talkfast enough to cover all of the thingsat the time even as a child before likethe internet was really popular Ialready knew that but like I said so Inever I really then I go I guess youcould say like red pill moment was Iguess my grandmother used to called mewhen I was a child and tell me you knowthe government they're listening to yourphone calls they're gonna get you I'd belike what the hell you know she wasright and so I was like oh grandma Iguess you are right because you wouldalways stop the phone call and beyelling at the people listening for likea 2 or 3 minutes like y'all better getoff my damn phone call I'm trying totalk have you listening and you know andthen you know more stuff you talk aboutand then you know that's a differentstory but I mean even it's so you knowthey've always I guess these people whoare hip and cool wanna like forceeveryone to be like all politically oneway or whatever yes I've never reallyliked me I didn't really know who thesepeople were growing up I just knew thatthere are certain types of people Ididn't like and lo and behold they'rerunning around with they've all gatheredtogether and they're running aroundattacking peoplewho don't you know who don't believewhat they believe how dare you not be acommunist like even if it was likeanything how dare you not be a you knowa fan of this team like ok well ifyou're coming around time enforced menot only do the exact obviously did youpiss me off it's hot outside it's like Isaidhashtag walk away movement I had to cometo this it had already been to this butthey couldn't find a like a hashtag signyou know a thing that actually you knowstuck like I'd like to have the fakenews when people heard that you knowthis busts out laughing Wow fake newsyou know what I mean so the hashtag walkaway is here and people are doing itthey're tired of being told that theyhave to you know essentially to me I'mgonna be honest with you it's like thebasically watch all this TV be all hipdon't learn anything that makes anysense and give me your kids that'spretty much what they're what they'rewalking away from people are not okaywith thatand I guess you're just gonna have toliterally spark this off to getwhat you wantlike that's what it's coming to you'reseeing people all around America and allthese you know these these politicalgroups and these these ad your proptypes I mean like I said I have nothingagainst them personally as a human beingor blah blah blah but like I said if youcome and try to I don't know thempersonally so I can't person anythingagainst them I just have somethingagainst them fundamentally because whatthey're doing is anti me and it's racistand they're trying to exterminate blackpeople among all the other people in theworld so yeah I have a problem with thatand I don't care like what would youbecause like I said if they they even intheir mind they're sick crazy weird youknow underdeveloped still the same sizebrain mind it wouldn't even be fun ifpeople didn't resist so I mean I woulddo that anyway but I guess they justwant to go around and be like you know Iwant to rule the world and just liketouching on their self I mean whateverme it's weird that's what they're gonnado people are walking away and I'massuming like one more things happen youknow more elections don't go their waymore things happen but they're going tothey're gonna have to you know kick offsome really ignorant stuff and as youjust saw in Portland they stilloutnumbered you know the prayer vigilindividuals which is really awesome atUnited America first they outnumber themlike five to one and they still got beatdown and it was like they were throwingbombs and came with sticks and peoplejust weren't having it man and they'regetting angry like why aren't peoplehaving our takeover plan cuz no go toEurope and go do that stuff over therego somewhere yeah cuz you won't we knowthat it's like I said hashtag walk

guys my name is Mike a lifelong New YorkCity resident I've been living inBrooklyn New York for most of my lifejust about 40 years I've been aregistered Republican so I am what theycall a walk with not a walk away but youcan call me a walk away because I amwalking away from the GOP establishmentin New York State who is corrupt thereason why I am making this video it'sbecause I joined Brandon this week atthe New York City walk away at the LGBTevent and the Harlem events I am new tothe walk away organization I signed upas a volunteer and not as a event goerthe reason why did that is because melike millions of other Americans are fedup with the establishment and thecorruption and politics so a little bitabout me again I was born in BrooklynNew York raised here my entire lifepretty much the election in 2016 2017was a wake up call because just likemany other New Yorkers majority of ourfriends are liberals because we're in aliberal state especially if you'reliving in New York City I was a vocalsupporter of the president from day oneI had lost 95% of my friends and at thattime talking about politics with yourfriends while going out going out for adrink just was it was you needed therapyin its own after that it was very toughit was a lot of arguing back and forthemotions and not even hugging it outafter so needless to say I decided todistance myself from socializing at allI stopped going out stop dating it justwasn't worth it at that pointI became so reserved and anti-socialNew York City wasn't home for me anymoreI started thinking about moving awayjust like the other million every yearNew York State is actually losing abouta million residents to Texas in Floridayou know what made matters worsewasn't 2018 the New York state governorselection when the New York GOP nominatedmark Molinaro as their nominee forgovernor it pissed me offand the reason why I pissed me off atthe last 20 years the new state GOP thecorrupt New York state GOP hasn'tnominated any viable candidates yes youcan say it's New York City to blue stateyada yada yada but you want to knowsomething look at Trump Trump has wonand he won big time so stop telling meit's a blue state stop telling me theGOP has no chance in the 90s it wasstill a purple or even a blue state andwe had one of the best mayors whileMayor Rudy Giuliani and we had one ofthe best Governor Pataki and they alllasted for several years several umelection cycles but after thateverything went downhill as if the NewYork State GOP are I'm not even gonnacall them rhinos I think they'reactually Democrat in disguise they havedone nothing nothing if you asked aquestion for Mark Molinaro like I have Iasked him when he ran for governor if hesupports the president and he said no Ido not and he wasn't even shy about itso people would come up with this excuseno vote read vote read you know if youdon't vote read then what's gonna happenvote read I'm like I'm sorry I am NOTgoing to vote for a candidate that isnot the that does not represent myvalues now I'm not ultra conservativeI'm actually what they used to call acentrist but now is what we call alibertarian conservative we aresome social issues and ride on physicaland economical issues mark nellen RL notonly did he not stand the chance in anystate you know definitely not New Yorkwhich is a blue state like hello a guylike him should easily be able to winrighthe doesn't have not only the charisma hedoesn't have the the way he doesn't havethe talk and he certainly didn't garnerany attention whatsoever a friend ofmine who happens to be just like me he'sactually a walk away he was a lifelongLiberal Democrat who decided I think itwas like after we had severaldiscussions and he started doing his ownresearch and I took a tug gun rangewhich ironically switched him into alibertarian Republican he went shootingfor the very first time and his mindshave changed gum gum gum laws and stufflike that it was amazingstanding in line of the shooting rangewe were the only two white folks thereand everybody else was either brownHispanic or black and he was shockedhe's like up until now I thought it wasonly Hillbillies and white people thatour own guns in yada yada yada and herewe are and it's all minorities anywaysmy friend called me up and he said yoyou gotta check out this guy Larry sharpI'm like Larry whoo you know I didn'tremember Larry the Cable guy's a lot ofsharp like who the hell's he had neverheard of him you guys like he's the guythat's running for the libertarian partyI'm like libertarian party like dude ifyou're not running under a major partylike the Republican conservative partyor the Democrat Party you stand nochance whatsoever he starts arguing withme dude just check them out check themout check them out and you so excitedand it's not like he's trying to sell mean Amway product this is a friend ofmine is calling me upI mean for those of you that rememberEmily you know so hung up the phone andI just forgot itabout a week later I saw Larry sharpsname online and I said let me check outthe guy I watched some of his YouTubevideosthis guy sounded like a conservative Iwas like shocked I mean first of allforget that he's a businessman he wasnever about he was never a politicianyou can't just have every you know I'llsay that every businessman is is gonnabe good I mean as you see a New YorkState and New York City we had MayorBloomberg who's a multi billionaire butit was a commie a communist he was badfor New York but Larry sharp resonatedwith me for many many reasons he remindsme of Trump a lot without the rhetoriche's a very smart wooded type of guyhe's not boring and he looks like hesays what he means and means what hesays so I found out my friend mentionedto me that he was doing a town hall inthe city I should come and join him likeI don't know as much as I like the guythe guy's not it doesn't stand thechance in New York City it's a liberalblue city and just I mean it's alibertarian he's just not gonna win he'slike dude just come just trust me comemeet the guy and talk to him he's adown-to-earth guy I'm like yeah rightpoliticians down-to-earth I ended upgoing I fell in love with Larry sharpyou know what I was able to interactwith him on a personal level not onequestion did he try to like sort of notanswer the question everything wasdirect he didn't blink and satisfiedsatisfied my every reservation that Ihad about him except for the fact thathe wasn't the Republican andconservative nominee some of the thingsthat resonated with me about LarrySharpe is he spoke about how dad's inthe family court system in New YorkState don't stand a chance I myself as Ihave two children with my ex who lostevery single right to my childrenin New York State even in America ingeneral now dad's don't have rightsfathers do not have rights custodyautomatically awarded to the mother nomatter what and I am 100% a believerthat it should be 50/50 unless there arelike really really circumstances thatare harmful to the kids of course buthere it's automatically I mean you don'tstand a chance as a man as a dad as afather and and you know people complainhow come fathers and dads are not intheir children's lives and this is thereason people choose to walk awayhashtag walk away because mentally youbreak down after a while after fightingin courts of so long and we're nottalking here about having full custodywe're talking here about 50/50 and LarrySharpe was very very I mean he talkedabout that that was one of his mainthings he didn't talk about programs hedidn't talk about you know trying tosway people to vote for him over thisprogram I'll give you this I'll give youthat I mean this is real stuff themillions of dads in America are goingthrough and then we were also at thatpoint at the time of the Kavanagh lynchmob the me to lynch mob and I asked hima straightforward question what do youthink about the fact that we lost thatwere losing an America due processinnocent until proven guilty and he'slike that is absolutely wrong and as anation we fail to exist at the moment wetend to forget that people don't havedue process anymore and what happenedthe Kavanagh was despicableanother thing we touched upon was thefact that a million people are leavingNew York States every single year forTexas and Florida the reason is becauseit's the most taxed one of the highesttax states in America it's not friendlyto business it's not friendly tofamilies it's not friendly to nobody andpeople are leaving one last question Ihave to him before leaving the event theTown Hall I asked him in front ofeverybody did you support our presidentpresident Donald Trump he didn't blinkhe says if he is doing what's best forAmerica I am absolutely 100% behind thepresident unlike mark Molinaro who saidhe doesn't support the president andthis is a guy that's not even aRepublican he's a libertarian and hesays he supports the president I made onmy mission to try to reach out to theNew York State GOP and see if we can geta meet up a meeting this is already veryclose to the primaries it was like MarkMolinaro wasn't even garnering anyattention whatsoever and certainly notwith the GOP base I may have a missionto reach out the via Twitter to the NewYork State GOP to try to get a meetingwith Larry Sharpe and them and see ifthey would back him as the Republicanand conservative nominee for governorafter for you back and forth on Twitterthey blocked me now you think this iscommunist Russia communist China theyliterally blocked me on Twitter nowwasn't cursing at them or allows tryingto do is to open up dialogue and bringawareness to the fact the mark Molinarois not going to represent us and LarrySharpe has a real chance to representthe GOPafter they blocked me I became a vocalcritic of the New York State GOP and Iannounced that I will not be voting foreven though I knew that Larry sharp doesnot stand a chance as a libertarianalone in New York State I made it veryclear I will not be voting for the GOPnominee and I will be voting for Larrysharp even though I knew that he's notgonna make itand everybody was screaming red wave redwave howdy how do you vote for alibertarian you're ruining it how dareyou this is the difference betweeneverything every other organization thatsprung up in the last couple of yearsand hashtag walk away walk away is notabout voting Republican it's not aboutvoting red it's not about always alwayssticking to a partyit's about being informed and making theright choice in the right decision theright decision was not to vote for aperson that is not going to represent usmark Molinaro was not going to representus in New York State so yes my vote wentfor the libertarian knowing that he'snot going to win after the election Istarted to make plans thinking that I'mgoing to move I have to move out of NewYork State and that's my only way ofmoving forward I started to think aboutthe South just where am I gonna go I dida quick road tripNashville Tennessee New Orleans I wasgonna go on to Texas I just a littletired came back to New York on the wayback to New York I found out that thepresident was doing a rally in JohnsonTennessee and I said the heck with itI'm goingI met thousands of people the linesoutside was a mile long people didn'tget inthousands of people stood outsidesharing to a TV screen with thepresidentthese were Americans white brown blackHispanic Asian every walk of lifereligious atheists agnostics I waspumpedI came back to New York I started makingplans to move to Texas at the

see we're not box I know the signsbackwards this one this one did it thisis MIA this miss me and Macpherson sayhello say hello anyway my name is Susanand I was never a liberal it was neverthe new in alignment with any of that Iwas raised in a household that was veryvery progressive I have experienced therage of a progressive that feels are notin alignment with them from the time Iwas my earliest memories and growing upwe had a live-in housekeeper /babysitter a lovely woman named holylove I love that name I'll never forgether and she was black and my mother'sthing with you know attitude towardsminorities as I was growing up alwaysseemed to be like they can't make itwithout us meaning white people and Iremember you know as a small child Ididn't have the ability to articulate itbut I knew something was wrong with thatand then as I started getting a littleolder it was very confusing to me but Icoined the phrase that it was reverseracism I'm sure I'm not wasn't the firstone that said that but I don't know inmy mind that was the termI came up with I don't know where Iheard it or if it was whatever butbecause it just didn't make sense to meso fast forward to I don't know a whilenumber of years ago when my motherrealized and I don't know she's prettysmart woman which she really she reallyis but fast forward to the point whereshe realized that we were not inalignment politically and I remember oneday she just tore into me she was soangry it was scaryand so I've experienced progressive ragewhen you're not acting right not notdoing what they think you need to do butthe truth of the matter is based on mypersonal experience with people likethatis because they're so angry there isnever enough they'll always findsomething so if you accommodate themin the way that they're complainingabout that day it's always a movingtarget so you may accommodate them youknow one day with one thing and thenit's gonna be another thing and thenafter you accommodate that you knowthey're gonna be on to the next thingbecause I believe and I live in AustinTexas so what I've observed and I can'tsay that this is everyone but I can onlyspeak about my experience is the peoplethat are really progressive have youknow they've made their religion ortheir politics and their belief systemtheir God and so they're disconnectedand there's a big hole inside of theirheart their soul and they have to fillthat with something and it usually comesin the form of somethingof this earth that isn't right and ifthey only fix that then everything'sgonna be okayand it just goes

this is why I may never ever return backto the Democratic Party I was once aDemocrat ignorant to it because I didn'tknow I was raised Democrat you just voteDemocrat you know if you vote go voteDemocrat they're there they're there forus they're the ones that care about theinner city they they care about theminority you know they're gonna be theones that stand up for injustice and allthis other stuff is the fuel that thattriggered my mind to decide on the orthe way on the side of the DemocraticParty but I'll tell you what and this isunscarred truth I voted for Barack Obamahis second term I looked at all of thedebates and I said you know what thisguy's killing Romney I mean Romney'sarguments are very childish and Obama istalking real good and he's saying whathe needs to say and it sounds convincingto me you know and I voted for Obama andI thought that I made a good decisionand I thought that it was gonna turnthis country around because the guycould talk he's very smart he's veryarticulate he knows how to talk veryconvincingly he's charismatic I mean hegot all of the signs of a manipulator athis hand man and that's exactly what hedid to a lot of people that voted forhim the first time is he manipulatedsituations to talk real savvy and andreal smooth and and and he warned thehearts and minds of people but hispolicies were were hidden corruption Imean I have never seen so much you knowdiscourse in division amongst blacks andwhites in this country since I've beenalive I was born in the 80s I wasn'tborn back when you couldn't drink out ofsaying water fountain and all that stuffbut you know I have never seen so muchdivision this this guy has reallydestroyed the country and for others toagree with his methodology for others toagree with his planto move this country forward by HillaryClinton who's a crook in and ofourselves makes me feel like theDemocratic Party is is it's more of acancer and more of a manipulated forcethen they are doing goodthere ain't nothing improving in theminority community whished there's stillissues there's still drama going onthere still ain't ain't a lot ofequality going on and some of theseminority communities some of these lowincome communities the schools stillsuck you know there's not a lot ofeducational you know benefits there'snot a lot of programs that are helpingthese young minorities come out of asituation of you can say systemicoppression if you will you know some ofthese people behind the curb they can'tget out of the curb if you keep lying tothem lying to them and keep making themfeel like that they're victims of afalse narrative minorities are notvictim of police brutality it's not truebut they push it so that you can feellike they're protecting you when they'renot they creating false narratives sothey can protect you from somethingfalse and you don't even know it theytrigger hate towards police so they canmake you free the police because theyknow the police are in minoritycommunities a lot is heavy in therebecause a lot of crime happens inminority communities a lot of crimehappens and the low-income communitiesit's that's where it go it's not boundby race it's bound by economic positionsdispositions it's bound by you knowparental responsibilities it's a cycleof bad parenting it's a cycle of badfinancial decisions it's a cycle ofpeople who haven't had goodopportunities and they just squandergood opportunity to end up in a badplace it's a cycle and the DemocraticParty and some of the leadership that wehave in place right now aren't going toget people out of that situation byfeeding them food stamps by telling themthat the council against them by tellingthem that they're facing some type ofmysterious oppression when they're notyou know you should tell you should tellpeople the truth and not manipulate themtell the minority community that if youwant to make a difference then you needto get on a police department the policedepartment isn't your enemy but if youwant to make a difference then you needto infiltrate the police department andthen you need to patrol your owncommunities that's how you make itsuccessful if you want a riot no wedon't we don't you don't justify blacklives matter as the the the negativeorganization that the world can see somepeople may may be thinking somethingvery different than the mainstreamapproach in the rioting and theprotesting and the hate and the divisionand the racism that everybody in Americaand everybody around the world can seedisplayed on national TV from thisorganization instead of placating to theorganization what they should do is theyshould say you know what let's let'sgear this organization to focus on morecommunity introspection let's get theblack lives matter to go in thecommunity in protest and make it let itbe known across the world that we arenot letting criminals behave the sameways and I ghettos anymore or in ourneighborhoods anymore it's not happeninghomie you gonna have to come off thecorner for selling dope you ain'tselling it today you're not sending tomy kids no there ain't no dropout ratewe're gonna get together as communityfinancially and psychologically andwe're gonna motivate our children we'regonna get hundreds and thousandstogether instead of blocking the roadwaywe're gonna go into these schools andfind ways to volunteer to make sure thatall of our kids graduate and you knowwhat we could get a thousand so peopletogether and say if the police we needto get a thousand so people together andput money together to make sure that wecan scholarship some of these peoplesome of these young people that's comingout of college that don't have anopportunity don't have parents therethat are financially stable these arethe things that the Democratic Partyshould be preaching you don't sin youdon't you don't send staff from theWhite House to the funeral of a personwho's a criminal a person who knocked onfor a convenience store and then triedto fight a police officer for hisfirearm and in of charging at a policeofficer and if he if the situation wouldhave been reversedhe may have killed a police officer orhe would have been going to jail anywayfor multiple felonies been in prisonthat's not the representation thatthat's not the ideology that you want toextend to young people in these minoritycommunities to think that that'sglorified that that's acceptable if youdon't like what the police did okinvestigate it but that ain't acceptableas well that's not acceptable for you toact out a character and try to fightwith a police officerwe don't need leadership in this countrythat's going to placate to that we needleadership that's gonna focus on who weare I just watched a I looked at anarticle that said that we're given over$20,000 per um refugee $20,000 I meangive me give my family 20,000 I'll givesome of these people that I see on whileI'm on calls they can't eat and it'sliving check to check give them $20,000get them 2,000 give them a thousand givethem a job those things are gonna make adifference instead of bringing peopleinto a country and we've fallen apart wecan't even get along with one another westill dealing with racism and you'retalking about helping other people andbringing other people into this countrythat's not bedded we got terroristattacks happening all over the world inthese European countries and you thinkthat all of a sudden they're gonna digit I mysteriously not want to come intothe United Stateswe've already had plenty of them that'snot the leadership we need in thiscountry we need somebody's gonna standup and it's gonna say enough is enoughwe're not gonna be divided raciallyanymore we're gonna be one nation andwe're gonna focus on our nation firstand we're gonna help everybody elsesecond we're gonna we're gonna we'regonna be responsible about the rhetorictowards police we're gonna beresponsible responsible about endorsingyou know whether or not we're gonna dois criminals or going for presidency orcriminal organizations who callthemselves activists that's nothappening in this country and as thepresident United States we needleadership that's gonna stand up andit's gonna fight for American peoplethat's gonna stand up and fight for theAmerican police officer that's gonnastand up and provide assistance and notjust running their mouth about thecondition of the minority communitythat's what we need that's why I won'tbe a Democratas far as I know I won't be any moreunless they come out with a Democratthat's that they don't have the sameideologies is this I really don't thinksobecause I'm finding out that theRepublican Party is more along the linesof what most of the people that I knowmost of the people that I grew up aroundthey have the ideology of veryconservative Christian faith ideologymost most african-americans are veryvery strong in religion and the friendtold me this long time ago and I'mstarting to see it now that theRepublican Party is geared more towardsmy own personal beliefs pull yourself upby your bootstraps get get the job doneI don't have time to worry about peoplebeing racist towards me cuz I'm too busygetting it done you know saying youcould be racist towards me today you'llbe working for me tomorrow I'm not gonnacower down and tuck in the corner so allthese people don't like me because I'mblack no you keep up with that thatback-in-the-day mindset you'll beworking for mebe racist if you want to you're gonnayou're not gonna win this battleso I'm gonna get our first already byten minutes but I want to extend thatand say that and I hope that theAmerican people look at what they'revoting for take an evaluation don't votefor a crook and don't vote for somebodyain't gonna help your communityyou
okayso it has been difficultto record this video for a number ofreasonsi could probably spend all day listingoutwhy i'm leaving the leftall the instances in which i've wantedto all the timesi decided not to umthe back in the fourth i i could go overitfor days probably um but i will trynot to do that secondlymy friends have no idea how i feelpolitically speaking i've made it apolicy not to speak about politicsto them it really doesn'tseem like a good place to do that um andi just i guess my third reason is is iwork in a corner of publishing whereit'sparticularly unforgiving to holdunpopular viewsum career-ending kind ofunforgiving the mobs will come for youand burn you and anyone else that youum well that supports youand so to say that i have feltsilenced and afraid and quietlydisappointed i guess it's a good goodway to say itwould be an understatementto make it simple i'm leaving the leftbecausei can no longer wrap my head around thesenselessviolence that comes out of iti do not believe that whites areinherently racistany more than i believe that blacks areinherently racist or um asians areinherently racistor you know any other group is racist inany capacityi think when you start to believe thatsomeone is borna certain way is when you're starting tocommitthat racistyou know you're passing over thatthreshold umbecause people aren't people aren't bornwith those sorts of beliefs and ideasthose are things youyou learn umbut the left right nowhas all manners of people believing thatthey were bornbadi cannot wrap my head around iti have sat back and watched my friendshave conversationsamongst themselves where they all wantto get together and havewhite supremacy in me meetings you knowlikelike it's some book club except you'rethere to address your inherent racismand i've declined multiple timesum because i don't believe in thati don't believe the left understandspeople anymorei don't think they want toit reminds me of a time when i wasgrowing upi had a lot of emotional problems i wasin foster careand all i remembered for a short time ofmy life was feeling ragei was mad at my mom for abandoning meandi was mad at the world for even makingme if i was going to suffer and i wasmad and i was mad and i was mad and iwas so madi broke my things and ii destroyed things in my house i was somadthat i really did thinkat times that destroying and startingover was the only wayand i was a kid um i didn't reallyunderstand my own feelings and i didn'tunderstand how tocope with them or discuss them withother people and soi was ruled by them and i truly believethat the left hastaught its base to be ruledby their emotions their rageinstead of logicinstead of reason instead ofunderstanding the full picturedid i have a right to be angry i diddid i have a right destroy things overit probably notum but that's how i see itwhen i'm sitting in the left and i ijust feel likethere's so much rage that's directedeverywherethere are always problems but there arenever solutionsthere are always perpetratorsum and victims there are neverperpetrators who were probably victimsandthere are never victims who areperpetrators andeverything is very black and whiteto speak personally of somethingrecently that has just been pushing meover the edge andi'll again i'm trying to keep this shortso i don't want to go on foreverum again i work in publishingwe all talk about book burnings and howhorrible it is to havethose ideas scorched fromexistence butpeople were able to read them andpeople were able to make up their mindsabout that literatureabout those ideas that were in thosebooks but i can tell you with certaintyin publishing thereare dozens of books thatyou never know about every year becausethe left makes sure that they never getpublishedthe best way to ensure that people don'thave ideas can't express ideas is toconvince them that having them in thefirst place is wrongand to never write them down imagine ifanne franknever wrote her story downhow would you even knowi sit there on twitter and i watchpeopledestroy each other i see things abouthowwhite writers aren't as good at writersaswriters of color and white writers areinherently racist andwhite people are evil white peoplearen't wearing any masks andthere's so much rage everywhereand in publishing in particular there'senoughrage that people are umjoining to snuff out ideas beforeamericans can even see them beforepeople like you and me can even make upour own minds anddon't even get me started on the bs withthe mediaas of late i guess you can say that i amultimately leaving the left becausei don't see value in controlling whatother peoplethink what they say what they do howthey feel idon't think that that benefits societyat all i thinkhaving opposing views and being able todebate them make us stronger peoplei think the left has made itsfollowers weak followers who can't evenhearcriticism without succumbing to thei'm a victim of something mentality andi don't understand that i cannot wrap myhead aroundwhy beyond nefarious reasons you wouldeven want to haveyour followers be so ignorant andchildish and incapable of actuallycoping with the worldyou want trigger warnings but they'renot actually going to help youbecause when life actually happens toyou there'sno one there that's going to police itand make sure that you feel comfortablewith it andthat's what life has taught me and thatthat's life in general and ii can't wrap my head around the left andit's obsession withbubble wrapping and red tapingeverythingand i'm scared i i am scared to actuallysay that to peopleum in my field and say that to peoplebecause i have seencompanies being actually ripped down anddestroyedfor not even saying it explicitly likejust subtweeting or something andit's insanity but ii can't sit here and pretend anymorelikestripping people of language and thoughtisn't something that i consider to beabhorrent and cowardlyand really just childish soi am walking away
[Music]get my thoughts together and trying tosee if I could break this down and tryto see if I could bring Prince Wu senseinto some people I've been uh I've beena bit limited the Bronx for half of mylife I was born in Puerto Rico and Icame here I was raised back and forth Iused to live in Puerto Rico come to NewYork I wouldn't even lived in Chicagofor a little bit and my deal has alwaysbeen Democrat liberal and I recentlystarted moving more to the right and forthe reason is that uh I see that as alot of toxic negativity going on in theDemocratic Party and then the liberalside everything bothers them they wantto abolish everything everything willsoon and everything is racist and theydon't really see what it's straightthey don't really district and why I saythat is that all this thing going onright now with the police oh one ofthese phone please accusing everywheremen are being racist accusing everybodyyou know it's just a whole bunch ofnonsense that to me it really needs tobe addressed and really needs to be weneed to sit down and talk about this Isaw as a country because I see thiscountry going down the hill and it'sparticularly the Democratic Party thatis pushing for this and accusing Trumpof being the one that are is actuallydestroying the country when there'sactually dumb pushing to the straightestcountry and as we and it's crazy it'slike everything they do they actuallydoing everything they they actually pushforward and everything they always blamethe other side or being the ones doingit when it's done is doing it it's likeit's crazy and for example they like toaccused Trump of being a pedophile arapist when is the Democratic Party inparticularly this big mostly there'smostly evidence of that and also theelection Madelene there's all anelection fraud they always accuse thoughthe Republicans are being the ones towin it when it's done there's moreevidence out there that they actuallyare the ones that always do this fraudsin elections and it's just reallygetting out of hand are we at me as aPuerto Rican I had to sit down thinkabout this because we are black and weare white and we are Indians and we haveall these combinations in our in ourrace that I feel that we are the onlyones that can clear have a clear voiceand unite the countryI understand people have different viewsof economic systems some people withsocialism others love capitalism I usedto be a socialist I used to be I used tobe a Fidel Castro fan check about a fanI used to have I follow that that thatvision I used to participate a lot inall Puerto Rican Nationals activities Iused to be very anti-american I used toalways hate America and everything wasracism the government was the most evilbut it came to a point in my life that Ireally had to think this throughthere's America that back this is thegreatest country in the world why I saythat because we have the best freedomswe have the best Constitution created byman now are we gonna sit here and blameour founding fathers for what the [ __ ]they did hundreds of years ago itdoesn't make any sense to me it's likeif I want to destroy it we have it wehave a monument in Puerto Rico it'scalled a car dealer motor it's abeautiful castle and all someone andit's a very touristic place I usuallyevery time I got out I go to Puerto RicoI have to stop by and be in that areabecause it's just doing so much peace tome and I don't know it just I just loveit and it's a beautiful infrastructureand I just appreciate it I appreciatethe history I appreciate everythingabout it and I think about it so wedestroy a guardian immortaljust because slave owners created it arewe really gonna go down that road are wereally gonna go down the road the strongalso have one the hole or someone justbecause Spanish slave owners createdit doesn't make any sense to me it's ourhistory we need to love it and Iappreciate it regardless of whathappened it's over with it doesn't existanymore why can't we just move on as acountry and just face the issues theyactually access right now we're fightingagainst things that doesn't even existanymore we don't please seem slaverywe're not facing any oppression stop itstop crying like a baby you're stupidand you're silly you see everything Idon't know what kind what kind of Idon't understand how can these peoplethat think they are smart they actuallysome academics think this way it's justus thing I don't get it how can you beso dumb and so ignorant and so miss themfor are we gonna go down the roaddestroying this country just becausewe're fighting a ghost literally we'refighting bossesthis is doesn't make any sense to meit's just crazy a human family hey myfriends your people that I know for solong talk like this he just it'smind-blowing it's just how the hell doyou even fight a ghost how you fightthings that happened hundreds of yearsago that doesn't affect you anyway howyou want to bring it up stashes doesn'taffect you at all and oh it doesn'taffect you and kills me shows like itdoesn't make any sense to me why youcancelling shows for just because youdon't like it doesn't mean somebody elsemight not like em I like it you knowit's if you don't wanna watch it

country we have both paths alot of issue there's always gonna beproblems in our system cops are not allracistI see listen when I used to live in theSouth Bronx I still live in a bras butnow I livethe Northside but when I used to live inthe South Bronx but one third year youbroke Avenue there was an officer callRamirez he was a Puerto Rican officer heused to abuseeverybody everybody used to be scared ofthis [ __ ] he is so abuseparticularly the PO Regis that's thecrazy part I seen black officers killblack peopleI seen white officers killing whitepeople I see Indian officers kill peopleof color it doesn't matter the problemwith this country is that police got toomuch community their abuse their powerand since they know they could get awaywith it most of the time they using andabusing that's the problem with thiswith a situation right here right nownot that you're all cops are race is notthe old way people are racist we have aproblem with this country that policethink that they could get away withanything that's the problemand we that's what we need to addressnot accuse everybody not not go crazynow casually now just by destroying thecountry we need to address the

good afternoon everyone my name isRichard bit Nick I am from New Jerseyand I am a proud the new member of thewalk away group I think that this is anamazing opportunity for so many peopleto come together from many walks of lifeto stand tall for the things that makeAmerica so special a little bit about meI'm a single gay man I have usuallycentered my attentions toward theDemocratic Party up till about 2016 whenHillary Clinton was you know pursuinggetting the nomination and I wasviolently against Hillary Clintonbecause I felt she was a liar and shevoted for the Iraq war and she hadinformation knowing that that war was afraud and she went ahead and voted forit anyway and I just knew that she wasno good so I was searching around and Iactually had contact with Bernie SandersI was living in Vermont several yearsago I was the CEO of a large nonprofitthere and Bernie and I kind of like cametogether because I had an issue with myfather he was in a veteran's home andthe senator and his staff are wonderfuland they helped me very quickly resolvea problem that had been ongoing foralmost two years so I thought he was aman of his word and I owe the greatestrespect for him and then when theelection thing was going on and theDemocratic conventionI was quite appalled by the events ofthe convention and I was shocked thatBernie caved in and just gave up andjoined Hillary Clinton when quitefrankly WikiLeaks gave him thenomination on a silver platter but heweek and he didn't really want to bepresident I'm assuming and it reallyupset me in a great way and I knew themthat I would never vote for HillaryClinton if my life depended on it andI've been searched out and I voted for athird party candidate quite frankly as Ithink about it my whole life I've alwaysbeen somewhat of a libertarian and avery independent person with my ownviews of the world and I've seen a lotin my life I lived abroad I am welleducated I have two masters degrees Itraveled all over the world I've been toevery continent except Antarctica andI've seen a lot from in third-worldcountries to you know first worldcountries and so you know I just feltthat you know I couldn't vote for anyonewho didn't represent my values andHillary Clinton does not represent anyof my values of Who I am as a person andI'm proud to say that and so on electionnight when we watch the Returns comingin and we saw that Donald Trump wasbeating Hillary Clinton one state afteranother a friend of mine and I werechatting online and we were justlaughing about it with glee because somuch of the fake news had said all alongthat Hillary Clinton was gonna win by alandslide and I was so thrilled to seeher defeated I was not one of theseDemocrats who was crying my eyes outthat you know Trump and one I thoughtwow he's an independent man he's run alot of big businesses and he's going toshake everything up and just as Ithought he would he's been shakingeverything up in Washington and a lot ofgreat things have been happening and I'mvery excited about what's happening inthis country because I was so afraidthat people like myself who areindependent thinkers we're going to bewashed under the rug and wewould you know we wouldn't be able toeven exist in this country anymore soI'm thrilled to say that I thinkPresident Trump is doing a great job andI really believe he's trying to makeAmerica great again and yes there's beena lot of saying that you know he's acorporate man and everything else but hehas a great understanding that if themiddle class doesn't survive and thrivethe people who are wealthy are going tothrive either because the country as awhole can't really succeed if everyonedoesn't succeed and he's a businessmanand he understands that so I like histenacity I like the way he negotiateswith things it's very very different andyou know I read an article the New YorkTimes just the other day from theirarchives from 1984 where they werequoted as saying that Donald Trump wouldmake a wonderful and great presidentwell that is one truth that we know thatthe New York Times has written about andso it's kind of like exciting to see andI'm just so happy to see so many peopleon this site and reading and listeningto their stories because so many of ushave very very different upbringings anddifferent experiences but in the end wehave a common goal and that common goalis that we want America to succeed andwe want America to be great again and weknow it's going to be great again andyes there's a lot of nastiness andinsanity going on on the left sadly butI came up with a a logical term formodern-day liberalism modern-dayliberalism is emotionalism - any logicand when logic goes out the door chaostakes over so everything I see from thenew Supreme Court nominee and theinsanity that's already starting it justgoes to show that these people aretotally unfit to rule this country Imean they basically believe in anarchyand the terrible ways that people arebeing treated who don't agree with theirside that I'm seeing day in and day outif you're not a politician a young manwho was a restaurant getting hiscoca-cola thrown in his face and havinghis half taken away from him at the timeit's just so horrendous I mean so I'mhoping that we as a group will just keepgetting larger and larger and larger andthis November I'm just I'm predictingthere will be a great red wave that'sgoing to be flying all over our countryand I'm very excited about thatso thank you again Brandon for thiswonderful opportunity for so many peopleto come together it's just truly amazingand I really want to do something withthis group to make a difference I havethe time the energy and the passion andI'm very excited to be here and thankyou again for giving me this opportunityto tell you a little bit

opportunityto tell you a little bit about my story
my name is Nicole fabu and I walked awaya little over a year ago got myregistration card in officially aRepublican I did my walk away video along time ago with last night I waswatching Brandon's video and Brandon Isaw your frustration I feel yourfrustration and I am there I have aneight-year-old son who his politicalviews aligned with me a lot I'm sure my11 year old son's does as well but myeight year old son had wanted to do avideo a while back about a cause II Ohgorgeous because she gets on his lastnerve too and we were watching the newsone night we were watching one Americannews I actually have it on right now andbless his heart he saw when the littlegirl's family had too many AOC familyhad to take down her page and all ofthat because she was getting deaththreats and they were getting deaththreats and all of a sudden my veryoutspoken vocal son didn't want to sayanything he had wanted to do a livevideo I turned it on I didn't want to doit he didn't want to do it at all it waslike he was terrified to say a word andit made me so mad that these people onthe left and I say it like thatthe far left that are giving deathrights to childrenthey're already silencing the generationcoming

the dominican republic my parentsto this day are not u.s citizenshowever as a child i was just trained tobe a democrati went to the public school system innew york city iwas born and raised here but i did livein the dominican republic for four yearsso you could probably say that i justbeen you know a new yorkerall my life right so then like i toldyou guys alreadyall i have ever known is the democratparty if you're born blackor latino all you're taught is just tobe democratic there's no questionasked and if i was to randomly go aroundthe streets here in brooklynand ask people why do they like thedemocrat party so muchyou can best believe there will beabsolutely no answerregarding policies you're just trainedto be democratic with no train ofthought no questions no reasoningwhatsoever when obama became presidenti was highly upset why because i wasunderagei graduated high school in 2008 and iwas only 16.um as the month went by i turned 17so i was still unable to vote but i washighly excited because my sister is acouple of years olderand she was able to put in the vote forobama so i was really excited so wasso were my parents right until i startedto notice somethingthat was kind of creepy and disturbingwhat i started to noticewas that anytime anyone dare to questionany policies regarding obamapeople will say with your racist peoplewho label youpeople who say that you were a traitoror self-haterand i thought it was very disturbing ialso thought it was quite disturbingwhen obama was put in office there wereplenty of videos all over the mediaum social media platforms with peoplesaying that oh we run the white housenow we can do whatever we wantpeople were going to stores robbingother people and again i thought it waspretty disturbingas time went on and with the recentevents that have taken place with donaldtrump becoming presidenti started to notice the trend on socialmedia of people insulting other peopleof people calling white people racist orcalling youyou know saying that you want to bewhite if you are black or latino oryou're an otherand you voted for donald trump pleasekeep in mind i did not vote for donaldtrump righti didn't but at the same time myconsciencewasn't sitting well with me i realizedsomething is wrongwhen you cannot speak your mind as anamerican and people want to label yourracistsomething is wrong when we just want togo around labeling every white person asa racistbecause they support trump i don'tunderstand thatit seems like everyone just won thewhole world in america hereto just be democratic and i don'tunderstand it we have different partieswe have independentwe have democrat and we have republicanhow is it possible that people onlyexpect everyoneto just vote democratic it doesn't makesense it's not though adult things to doand if this is supposed to be aso-called democratic nationwe all have the right to exercise ourvoices and our votesso it just really freaked me out and istarted to see the trendon my social media page i have familymemberspeople that have known from high schooland othermiddle school classmates as well thatjustliterally the whole day they will postthings aboutif you support trump you want to bewhiteyou will never be white and it doesn'tmake any sense why becausea lot of the democratic politiciansthey're whiteand you still vote for them and you'reblack and you're latino rightso i don't understand how we'll considervom and do this kind of nonsensewe could not have an effective dialoguewithout people living you aoh self-hater i don't understand and ithink it's quite dangerousand i personally do not like thedirectionand which we're heading to so i startedto do research and i started to realizethat people want to silence youpeople want to sign it to you becauseyou do not agree with the majoritypeople want to silence you for having adifferent train of thoughtand it's crazy to me that no one seeksto see the policies in place from thedemocratic partyand how they really affect the blacklatino communityit's crazy to me that if you darequestionthings that are going on in the mediapeople come and attack youpeople screenshot your post people lookyou up in linkedinpeople make you go viral and peoplewrite to your jobso that you can get fired and guess whatthey do they do get you firedit seems like to me that we're headinginto some kind of comedy societyand quite frankly with you i don't likeiti don't like it i want to use my braini want to be able to exercise my rightand i want to be able to speak my mindfreelyon all social media platforms withoutbeing attacked without being called aself-haterwithout being called a withoutbeing in fear possibly losing myjob and my reputation because people donot want to accept that i have adifferentpoint of view it's quite sad and it'svery scaryand it seems like no one wants to takeany time or any kindof accountability okay we cannot gothrough all our lives sitting here andi'm speaking this as a black personokay i am a black latina we cannot goall our livesjust labeling everything is racismthat's not the correctway to do it where is the accountabilityand then when you do actually want tospeak out against the issuesin our communities nobody wants to hearabout it they don't want to talk aboutit everything has to be racism this andracism that and i'm sick and tired of itbecause guess what i have to be honesthere and say thati have been treated better by whitepeople than have ever been treatedby other dominicans and other blackpeople and that is just my reality i'mspeaking from my point of viewand this is not to make this a racialmatter i just want to be honestand it really bothers me that i feellike i'm being sun so all over the placebecause of fear of retaliationi've also seen some of my social mediafriendsturning people saying you know i'm gonnablock you if you don't support blacklives mattersi don't want to be friends with you ifyou don't support black lives mattersbecause automatically not writing astatus about black lives matters oranything like thatmeans that i'm a racist means that idon't care aboutmy community regardless of the fact thatyou don't know what the hell i'm doingbehind closed door for my communityno one wants to take accountability fortheir lives i've never been oppressedi'm sorry to say that but this is truei have created my own youtube channelsto talk about my childhood traumaand the things that i've gone throughbut hear me out i am no victimokay i grew up in a household with nolove okayi was told by my own mother in spanishthat i would never amount toshe told me that i was dumb even told meaboutpossibly how i was almost averted as achildand guess what i don't go through ourlife treating people like crapbecause of what i want through there'sno excuse for thatnone that's like me having a child andtreating my child like crap becausei was treated like crap so they have topay for it that's not the correct wayi am now an adult so i do have to takeaccountabilityi do have to reprogram myself to becomea better personand become very self-sufficientand basically you know learn the ways oflifebut i did not go throughout my wholelifejust saying you know oh you know i don'thave a better job if it's because of myparents i cannot do thatyes it has affected me deeply but at thesame time we're not takingaccountabilityfor the many issues that are in our owncommunitiesthat are caused by our own our own doingso i don't understand that yes my sisterwere oppressedmy ancestors i don't know oppressionbecause i can go get a jobi can go live where i want to be i cango travelwherever i want and that's what i'vebeen doing for years now traveling allover the worldnobody's stopping me nobodyand this is beyond the democraticrepublican party it's about the factthat in americasupposed to be a free nation you can'teven speak upyou can't even speak of your own truthwithout people leaving you a kind ofracism self-haterwe have people literally destroying ourcity destroying black owned businessesin the name of so-called justice andwhen you put outthe hypocrisy people want to get upsetwhen i pointed out the hypocrisyat the fact that we were locked up formonthsand told that you're gonna kill yourgrandmother if you go outside and you'reselfishfor wanting to open up theeconomyright you recall type on him idiotstupid selfishbut all of a sudden it was okay to goprotest and do large gatheringand no one care about coronavirusanymore and when i'm pointing it out onmyfacebook i was tell well people have todo whatever they have to dono common sense there's no logics juststraight up acting out of emotionand that is very dangerous trust me i'ma very emotional personi'm a very sensitive person but at thesame time i do exerciselogic and emotion i mean logic andcommon sensebecause i have a braini have a brain and people need toutilize it properlyso here's my story because i am sick andtiredof people telling me that i just had tovote democrati'm sick and tired people telling methat i'm a racisti'm sick and tired of people not wantingto accept the many issues that arearound our communitiesbecause everything just wants to be ohif you vote for trump you're a trumpsteruh how could you be a republican sochildish it reminds me of narcissism youknow what narcissist people dothey never take accountability for theirissues everything is alwayseveryone else's fault by themselvesso that's my story andlet's see what's your story

for longesttime I bought it without question and myjunior year of high school I ended uptaking journalism and ironically Ireally valued the integrity of trueauthentic journalism of hearing having abalance of both sides and so even thoughI live in a extremely liberal householdI actually have a dad who is a devoutconservative Christian Republican whowas actually from El Salvador and cameto the states when he was 18 enlisted inthe army and currently works as aphysical therapist and the Coast GuardAcademy so one evening I was inConnecticut and I sat down with my dadand I basically asked told him I want tohear your side of the story I willlisten and I want to know your thoughtsand all the various topics and so I satand listened to him and the longer Iheard his side of the story it reallyshook up my world because I all myarguments were based on the emotion andillogical conclusions and I it reallyshook me to the core and I had to goback home and really process it and thatfollowing summer I started doing my ownresearch on various political andcurrent eventsonce I realized how wrong everything Ibelieved in was I had to really look into myself and realized that I had tomake a decision between what myreligious and morals are the beliefs areand where I stood politically at thatpoint and one side really took a lookinto myself that's when I knew I had tomake the

ever tell anybody aboutand i just kept pushing that down wellwhen my marriage fell apart i just gotto a point where i was like why am ieven doing this i justi'm trying to live this life that it'snot me i need to i need to be me so icame outand i was so worried that all of myconservativeand my my fellow catholics were weregonna turn their back on meand and shun me and they and they didn'tum i think they were surprised you knowand um and it was okay and i was soexcited i was so excited to like finallybe a part of this community thati had been an outsider looking in forall of my life and i felt free i feltliberated and i was like i can finallybe myself i can finally be with a personthat i want to be withum and so i joined the gay community andi was i feltme for the first time in my life andthen as i started spending more timewith these individualsand you know the elections start comingaround and issues on politics startcoming upi found that i umbasically stepped out of one closet sothat i could walk into another onei i guess i'm more afraid ofcoming out as a conservative with myfriends than i ever was coming outas a gay woman in a mostly conservativecommunity and that's really sad to meum i was lucky enough to actually findprobably the only other conservativelesbianwhere i live in my city and we'remarried now and it's great and it'swonderful and we're happyi don't i don't know how i got so luckybuti actually am authentically afraid oflosing my friends and it's so hurtfulbecause i see all the things that theypost on facebookand twitter and instagram and if theyknew that i was a conservativethey would know that they're basicallyattacking mepersonally and condoning harassmentand and violence and hateagainst me umone of my best friends is transgenderand he wasn't when i met himhe was a she and she was a lesbian andyou know and i've supported himhis entire journey i was there for hisfirst tee shot i was a backup dancer inhisfirst drag king show and i've beenvery supportive of this and i will gotake care of him whenever he has topsurgery and i'm afraid that if i tellmy friends i'm going to lose my friendsbecause i can't be who i am and i can'ti can't be honest with this thistolerant and loving andum love is love communitybecause i don't feel the same way thatthey doabout killing unborn babies orabout just having open borders or aboutour presidentand and it makes me really sad so i'vei've really struggled with making thisvideoum because i've never felt that in therepublican or the conservative communityi've neverfelt that kind of animosityum and soi guess i'm finally coming up to saythat if i lose some friends because ofthisthen it is what it is because i spent myentire life living in a closet and ican't do it anymoreand so i've decided that i have to walkawayyou
hey walk away family I wanted to make avideo uh detailing some of the objectiveexperiences that I had when I wasworking along the us-mexican borderwhile I was living in Arizona I wantthis to definitely be objective butbefore I get into my objectiveexperiences I wanted to first let youknow on how I stood when I was workingthere in Arizona um at that time I wasvery liberalit was 2015 um I may have been asophomore in collegeduring that time I actually registeredas the Democratic Socialist of Americamember and they sent me their awesomecard a little red card and the may ormay not have given me voting rights I'mnot sure you know I don't even know thatI still have it I wish I would look forit so I could've showed it to youbecause it has their platform on it andat that time part of their platform andI'm sure that it still is and probablyabove and beyond part of their platformwas the elimination of borders and whenI was there working along the border myfeelings towards Border Patrol bordersecurity were very mean I honestly I wasme and even told my boss that I didn'twant to speak to them that if they comeup to me and talk to me I did not wantto talk to them how was the kind ofperson it was like if these people wantto come across our border they shouldcome across our border and we shouldn'tbe stopping them and that's how I feltabout itinvented I know it's a little it's notas black and white as the situation isnot as black and white as that but I'mone let you know where I stood at thattime very liberal very democraticI registered as a Democratic Socialistof America said into that elimination ofborders let's have all the migrants comeacross that's where I was at that timein 2015 so now what you know how I stoodat that timeum I do want to preface this with um alittle bit of tidbits if you look andthe little doobly-doo below this videoI'm going to provide some newsinterviews where Obama opens up hismouth and you can see him talking we canhear him talking about some of hisimmigration policies how he felt aboutimmigration and then you can see someother articles and like snopes.com forexample about some of the track recordsthat Obama had as president dealing withimmigration just a few things to pointout if you have dissenting opinions goahead and watch those videos like I'msaying I don't want to beat up on Obamahe's not the president the moment Idon't want to beat up on trial I'm gonnagive my objective experiences but it'sunfortunate that the last has developedsome sort of cognitive dissonance evenprobably conveniently forgotten Obama'strack record on immigration it alsoseems that the left or the generalAmerican public is ignorant to the factthat the concentration camps Oh see thatstupid narrative that's being pushed byuneducated people quite frankly Obama'sthe one who built those concentrationcamps let's not forget that he's the onewho built them so I want the last justwake up and realize that as much as youwant to criticize Trump and granted whenhe messes up he should be criticized youknow but let's not forget that Obama wasguilty and exponentially more guilty ofsupposed immigration crimes then Trumpwas that's all I want to point outbecause it seemed that the leftdefinitely has forgotten that andpoint-blank period I'm not gonna leftI'm not gonna let the left forget it sohaving said that please do watch thoseum news interviews down at the bottomyou'll learn some interesting facts I'llgo ahead and spit out a couple there fora whileObama averaged a thousand deportations adayit's quite a lot he's deported morepeople than any other president in UShistorythird one what I think of mm-hmm some ofthe magnet children that come across didyou guys remember the hundreds ofthousands of migrant children that werecoming across which I think may havebeen the catalyst for building thoseconcentration camps Obama said that hecould not guarantee he's go watch thevideo could not guarantee their safetycould not guarantee that they would makeit back home alive so he told theparents through the news do not sendyour kids here some of those kids hesent back ended up in the hands of childtraffickers crazy by but we want to puta sighs trap okay anyway having said allthat please do watch those videos butnow that you know how a stirred while Iwas working in Arizona I want to goahead and provide to you what Iexperienced some of the things that Isaw some of it very sad some of it Ican't even elaborate on very well justone of those things that touch that youcan't just form words about very verysad very sad situations so we do knowthat something has to be done and at theend of this video I hope that you canresearch and form your own opinions onwhat you think should be done you knowmaybe it is that a wall isn't the worstidea we shall see I'm no expert on youknow border issues and neither are theleft who are perpetuating thoseconcentration camp narratives neitherare the Democratic socialists who wantthe obliteration of borders we are asovereign state we are a sovereigncountry I want to say stakes that's thetechnical term we are a sovereign statewe will have definable borders that isthe way that it isso yeah I'm trusting in the governmentenough to hope that the higher upofficials will know what to do to fixthis this humanitarian crisis thishumanitarian crisis by the way for awhile didn't exist in the DemocraticParty remember well there's nohumanitarian crisis there's nothinggoing on at the border and thenmagically overnight they changed thenarrative and you know the right hasbeen saying that since I don't knowsince forever - something going on atthe border we need to stop it so I don'tknow the leftists Oh was she watching onthe issues I don't know what they wantto do was very confusing and they needto make up their mind but anyway here weare so I was working in Arizonasophomore in college is around the Year2015 I was near the towns of why Arizonaand Ajo Arizona when I first got cha hoeI was like why in the world wouldsomebody want to live in a town calledgarlic you know very beautiful townthough so I was working in organ pipeNational Monument there for a while thisNational Monument was the was the mostdangerous National Park in the countryit was closed off for I want to say 11years the majority of the pop was closedbecause a park ranger was actuallymurdered by a drug cartelit's very sad shocked and killed and inthe park today there stands a monumentto honor his memory now the park is backopen visitors if you've never been Idefinitely encourage you to go verybeautiful if you've never seen a saguarocactus let me tell you they probablystand taller than two or three NFLplayers stacked on top of each othercraziness so anyway I was working innational organ pipe National Monumentwhat I was doing did not actuallyinvolve hot border security I wasactually working in conservationI was restoring restoring theenvironment that have been messed up bymaybe social trails or or people gettinginto the environment through ATVvehicles I was trying to restore theenvironment make it look natural so thatwas specifically some of what I wasdoing there I also got rid of invasivespecies that shouldn't have been thereso he had his general conservation workso that's what I was doing them there soit was not part of order security oranything related to the borderon however while I was there doing thisconservation work and I'm being veryliteral when I say this I literally wasat the border directly at the border atone point actually stuck my hand underthe fence and my right hand was inMexico we were that close to each otherit was very interesting also to be ableto wave at the people who were livingacross the border knowing that I'velives were so different you know ourlanguages were different our cultureswere different our religions wereprobably different but I mean we shareda common humanity but it was very coolto be able to you know wave at them andyou know just say hello and I'm surethey thought it was very cool to waveand say hello to us or work in there aswell this is very sobering to know thatthis little fence just an inch across ofit towards Mexico and an inch acrosseither towards the US things wereprobably completely different uh crazyto think about - right um so some of thethings that I saw when I was there it'sbeen a little bit ago um so my detailsmay be a little bit fuzzy but while Iwas there working I saw bicycles so manybicyclesum I guess migrants ride these bicyclesover and occasionally pop workers willfind all these bicycles scatteredthroughout the desert I mean they keepthem - I remember seeing a big pile ofbikes in the park and they becomegovernment property actually so manybicycles I've never seen so manyarticles of clothing scattered around inthe most remote random places throughoutthe desert shoes my muscle shirts and Isaw bones near clothing articles whichwas crazyum I don't think it was but a questionmight get help but to be like oh my goshdid somebody die here umdon't think so but I do remember hearingfrom these MPs workers that every sooften they would find a dead body of amigrant coming across who unfortunatelyhad died from maybe heat exhaustion ordehydrationwhich is very sad you know I'm just verysad in general but not unheard of tofind dead bodies scattered throughoutthe desertwhat else did I see that's all blackwater bottles um that's that's the thingwhen it comes to the illegal immigrantsthe migrants coming across and blackwater bottles are a thing I saw so manyscattered throughout the desert I thinkthe thing is that if they think it'sblack maybe you won't be seen um maybelike camouflage in but black waterbottles scattered throughout everywhereshoes shirts bicycles water bottles justrandom places all throughout the desertand so you know people have been comingacross like obviously people have beencoming across I will say I found mygroup found a cellphone how thecellphone survived the desert heatbeyond me was it melted don't know howwell I do know how long it had beentherewe got the cell phone and we charged itI was looking throughout the textmessages the text messages were inSpanish vernacular Mexican Spanish thelast text message had been sent over ayear ago so that tells you how long thatcell phone had been sitting in thedesert that was first of all just tomake the South all messed up that longbut that was also very sobering you knowwho you have to think who had the cellphone who was calling on it did theymake it would it they go - are theyalive are they dead are they are theystill here you know it would be amazingto know the stories and the people thatare attached to these items I don't wantto determine eyes than evaluatedehumanize these items obviously but nowsomething very interesting to find andso here are some of the more highlightsof what I saw and experienced these arethe good ones while I was working oneday there were there was some BorderPatrol I think we were just getting offwork I spend in 10-hour days and thesein this desert I don't think we quitework ten hours just because theexhaustion we would wake up real earlyin the morningson come up and try to be done by noonjust because the heat um think it waswhile we were leavingI specifically remember seeing childrenI cannot remember if it was two or threebut there were children children acrossour border in the middle of the desertBorder Patrol was giving them water andI don't know what these children weredoing across the border and they weretrying to I think maybe they were justplaying and ventured across or maybethey were actually trying to make itacross because you know June 2015Alana was president and there was youknow all those illegal migrant childrenhundreds of thousands it was it was abig deal coming across and he didn'tknow what to do with all these childrenI don't know if they were a part of thator notbut maybe they had a house just rightacross the way and they were playing Idon't know but I just specificallyremember seeing Mexican children acrossour border in our country in the desertin the heat getting water from ourBorder Patrol I was like oh my gosh ohmy gosh these poor children these poorkids thank God for our Border Patrol whowere out there helping them and givingthem water wherever they are definitelyup there safe but that's a point that Iwanted to make mention another point Iwant to make mention one day by weregetting off work we were um debriefingFriday putting things up cleaning upgetting ready to head back to to ourbase and we were approached by a migrantman I don't know that I ever got hisname but he asked us for a ride he toldus some of the story this man was on aMexican man I do not recall if he toldus what country he was from him notbeing Mexican he was either from CentralAmerica a country in Central Americawhere he was from the continent of SouthAmerica what country found I don't knowbut he had made his way into Arizona whowas whether crossed the borderhe made his way into Arizona and I wasasking you know for a ride granted inthe nature of the work that I was doingwe could we could not provide him a ridethere are checkpoints all throughoutlower Arizona in these areas where theystop you and they can assume if theyhave reason to believe that you have anillegal immigrant in your car I don'tknow the rolls behind it but I assumethey can search your car I neverexperienced that but I do did experiencethese stopping points and obviously youknow they were like okay go ahead and gothrough but I saw this my good man evenif I hadn't been on the job I don'tthink that I would have been comfortablemyself even though my heart went out tohim I don't think that I would have beencomfortable giving him a ride as acivilian not to say that he wasn't anice man just from my conversation butthe fact that he walked and hitchhikedhis way into our country and to behonest I don't know where this man is attoday I don't know if he found a safehaven I don't know if he made it I don'tknow if he was shipped back where hecame from but truth be told I hope thatthis man wherever he is at his livinghis best life I hope that he's blessed Ihope that God had his hands on him but Idid I ran into an illegal migrant whoasked me for who asked us for a ride tosay I guess safety someone who wanted togo and the man was not Mexican he'd madehis way up from Central America or SouthAmerica which is crazy crazy to thinkabout whyso besides seeing the children and beingapproached by a migrant man who was notMexicanwe saw drug smugglers we were advised onthe radio that there were people thathave been seen and that we needed to becautious we just carried on about ourwork later on we ended up seeing BorderPatrol on ATVs to have them a man oneach making their way back into Mexicodid these manif these men get their drug smuggledinto the countrydid they make their drops I can onlyassume that they made their drops withtheir drugs and they accomplished theirmission and we're being sent right backinto Mexico but I did I saw drugsmugglersI saw those with my own eyes drugsmugglers being carted back into Mexicoby Border Patrol on ATV so these thingsthat I saw these things that Iexperienced and this was a very briefsummary of the things that I saw andexperienced when I was there but youcannot tell me that there isn'tsomething going on at the border thereare drugs coming across our border thereare people coming to our border and theyare dying there are children at ourborder there are people dying cominginto our country from dehydration fromheat exhaustion there is a humanitariancrisis going on underwater and I don'tknow what the solution is I don't thinkany of us watching this video know thesolution is the hope and pray that Godcan enlighten our government on what canbe done but I will say that you know thesocialist ideas of eliminating bordersand just having every Tom Dick and Harrywho wants to come in to the country it'snot the way to go about it we have lawswe are a sovereign state even Obamahimself said one of these YouTube videosthat you can watch that you know even hehimself admitted that there was lawsthat were passed and that he was goingto abide by those he himself said it andTrump has echoed some of the very selfsame things that Obama has echoed so Iknow that the issue is not entirelyblack and white there is gray andespecially being a Christian your hearthas to reach out to these people who areliving in such poor conditions that theywant to come into the country to make abetter life for themselves make a betterlife for them family live the Americandreamwhich is what we are all living you knowwe are we have won the lottery you guysto be living in this wonderful countrythat's where my heart goes out thesepeople you know it's so sad to hear thehumanitarian stories that keep happeningat the border so something needs to bedonemaybe there's no perfect solution wedon't know but I hope that you can takemy experiences and some of the thingsthat I saw and add those to yourrepertoire towards your argumentwhatever it may be I wanted to beobjective about what I saw flash-forwardto 2019 obviously I have nothing to dowith the Democratic socialists obviouslyI'm about as conservative as they comemostly and thanks to the abortion issuehaving said that I don't take I justdon't take too kindly to listening toleft as people lecture or pretend to beconcerned about the people at the borderpretending to be concerned in that theycan't even protect the babies in theirown backyard from being murdered in thewomb or vote to protect abortionsurvivors after they have been bornalive they want to kill them how in theworld can you kill the children in yourown backyard and still pretend to careabout migrants at the border I don'teven let you me on wolves don't evenpretend to care about it becauseanything that comes out of your mapespecially under the guise of humanrights what I know that you are in favorof killing children at that pointanything that comes out your mouth Icall BS I don't even tell me hellohow many be able to accept that hello aslegitimate having said all that I don'tknow what needs to be done but you knowmaybe it is that a wall may not be theworst idea because some of the placesthat I saw at the border the fence waslike a rickety old fence you could crawlunderneath it you could crawl between ityou could jump over it it was and someother places it was falling apartliterally that was our border that typeof fence because as I told you I stuckmy hand underneath the fence and myright arm was in Mexicoif I were to took a running jump I couldhave jumped across the fence if I wantedto if we slid by between this fenceliterally in some places that was ourborderhow can people not get across you knowand other places the border was veryhigh-tech very tall little guard towerlooking things and then other places notso much so having said all that maybe awalls not the most terrible idea if itprotects people if it keeps people fromdying that keeps people from trying tocross if one person doesn't die becauseof this wall then the billions ofdollars that will have been spent on itwill be worth it because human peopleare so valuable you cannot place valueon a home on a human being I will gladlyrejoice in the billions that are spentif it keeps people from dying granted Ihope that as Christians we can find away to obey the laws of our nation anduh have the heart of Jesus to givehumanitarian effort and to come to somekind of solution they may not happen inour lifetime it may not happen ever inthis world that we live in but Icertainly hope that something what canbe done to help the situation at largeand to decrease the death and to did youknow just make this situation better soI want to say thank you for listening tomy experiences at the border I hope thatyou learned something hope it waseducational I encourage you to look atsome of the news interviews from Obamathere are down here below this video andyou can like you can comment you canshare what you need to do but anywaythank you for listening if you'velistened to this almost 25-minute videogod bless you and hope to speak to youguys more in the futuregod bless[Music]

little bit of my story is thatsorry we're kind of watching all of ourdogs out here on the property at thesame time I being in Texas born andraised definitely had Republicanconservative parents came I'm 49 yearsold right now had a very conservativereligious background raised in that cameout when I was 20 21 years old I didnatural push back from that my parentsdid a natural push back from that but Istill remained conservative I had a sonwith I had a son with my firstrelationship that I was in for 10 yearshe's now 21 years old amazing guy andI've lived in small-town Texas nowraising my son for pretty much hisentire life about thepast nineteen twenty years no issues nono discriminate oka no discriminationthank youuntil I voted for Trump and then when Istarted and then when I voted for TrumpI began to be shut down and not so muchfrom somewhat from gay friends butmainly from straight liberals probablybecause most of my friends being in arural Texas town are straight and notgay so I'll give give that credit wherecredit is due so I'm I'm very excitedabout this movement because Cait and Idiscussed frequently everyday politicalhappenings and and and and Cait is 30years old I'm 49 years old so we ofcourse come from you know very differentvery different backgrounds age gaps allthat and in in this movement that hasbeen happening so most of the pushbackthat I have been given is from straightliberal friends because most of thepeople that I associate with because weare in rural Texas I have more straightfriends and I have gay friends and Icome from a large city I come fromHouston Texas where most of my friendswere gay so anyways that's been aninteresting dynamicand I'm from Chicago my family is veryDemocrat and raising that CatholicDemocrat and I was a history major incollege

far and I'm thirtywe'll be voting for Trump in 2020 thisis also isn't meant to be a hugeendorsement for Trump video but we arejust really excited about this movementbecause I didn't vote because I mean Icalled Obama winning by a landslide inthe first election just seeing the mediacoverage and so we're really justexcited about people being able to talkabout more diverse ideas without beingit constrained to just liberal or justconservative or just kind of breakingaway of what the perceptions of thoseare because that's you know somethingthat I couldn't you know jump onto whenI became a legal voting age I justreally had distrust for politicians atthat time and knowing a you know bit ofhistory about like the internationalbanking systems and things like thatit's like well this is still kind oflike status quo whatever and it wasn'tuntil you know Trump where I really wasreally interested I didn't vote for himbut the subsequent actions that arebeing taken not in you know a purelyselfish way but there is this idea ofbeing self sustainable in general as amovement and I think we kind of alsohave to do that as a country to even beable to facilitatehelping other countries or other peoplewho are really in need but we just havea lot going on here that can be sortedthrough you know there's so many systemsand you know this you knowadministration and this leader is reallystarting to break away some of thosethings that we considered norm and Ithink that's kind of what the walkawaything is more about of the status quoisn't this desk whoa anymore like gayrights yes you know that all there donethat and there done that you knowwomen's rights and they're done thatright right your content of characterhas no basis on the color of your skinlike as Americans we've kind of gonethrough that and kind of seeing a littlebit of the manipulation of theDemocratic Party in particular is is ahit's that you know there's amanipulation of those things where ifyou're any sort of minority whetheryou're you know a woman or of adifferent different ethnic race orsexual orientationthey kind of like own you from the womband that's not a dichotomy thatAmericans are comfortable with anymoreand nor should they be and so we're justso excited that this movement came aboutright and kudos kudos to you Brandon weare well I personally I I can't speakfor for Kate my partner but have

everyone its Asia again back at the walkaway campaign I'm a lot of you asked meto finish my testimony and so I figuredI'm going to start where I start torealize I was conservative and not verymuch liberal there's nothing to it beingRepublican or Democrat this is aboutbeing conservative or liberal right soI'm gonna start for where it startedfrom me word got out about thisaltercation between candidate Trump anda journalist and Fox News megyn kellyand so I started watching megyn kellybecause I couldn't stand Trump sosomeone something said well if you don'tlike him and you respect this woman onceyou start watching her on Fox andironically watching miss Kelly did itmake me dislike Trump more it made medislike Hillary Clinton more which isironic considering they started watchingmegyn kelly while the Kelly file so Ican get more facts as to why I wouldn'tlike Trump the irony is hilarious rightnow for me she was my candidateCleveland Clinton was my candidate sheis who I wanted to win and then Istarted getting more information inregards to her Clinton the Clinton emailscandals and finding out more aboutwhat's coming off from the left andpeople were asking for transparency fromDonald Trump but not requiring that fromHillary Clinton I started seeing thedouble standards and the hypocrisywatching the Kelly file I havetremendous respect for megyn kelly Ienjoyed her book a heck of a lot settlefor more it resonates with me and mycore I don't really like what'shappening with her show on NBC you don'treally care for the network NBC but shedoes have my respect watching Kellymegyn kelly on the Kelly file iteventually led me into watching anotherwoman that I already known from earlieron in her career but on a different showjudge Jeanine Pirroand there was one particular openingstatement that stuck out the most to meand still does to this dayI want to say was either week before ortwo weeks before the oh that waselection night and in her open shelisted out all of the Clinton scandalsbetween for Bill and Hillary there wasone part in the open and I quote andfolks I haven't even got into the 21stcentury yet end quote she listed out sixdifferent scandals before she hit the21st century and that is saying that theClintons were an issue that weresupposed to be dealt with before I waseven bornthis is a problem for me because we'restill dealing with the Clintons and someof the residue that they've left in oursociety so starting from me megyn kellyis what kind of had me shift moretowards the right I can't say I'm fullyRepublican but I do know I'm notDemocrat and I'm not liberal and whenyou start really learning what it meansto be conservative and you were raisedlike I was and had a deacon for a fatheryou know and church and faith wasembedded in your bones and in your bodyyou can feel your creators no just justhis presence you can feel him be keptyou can feel him and I was raisedknowing that he was present if youbelieve that then that makes youconservative it's not liberal youbelieve in God you believe that youshould move in faith and in love andthat you should respect and toleratethose who you don't agree with that isconservative and I realize that oh snapI'm conservative that's not very muchDemocrat is it and then you realizeyou're not the issue aren't Democratsit's liberalism and this idea that wehave to be free from our traditions nowdon't get me wrong some traditions inthis country we had to get rid of butour judeo-christian ethics are somethingthat we need to keep as a society thatis what we need to keep saying and tokeep from breaking out into chaos everysingle dayI found myself in a cooler situationwhen I was 22 years old this is aroundthe time that's 21 turning 22 excuse methis was right after the election Ifound myself entering the real world andwhen I say real world I mean when you'removing out in your parents house andyou're starting to be on your own nowgranted I did have support of my motherand my stepfather when we moved out bothme and my sister but in hindsight Irealized that that decision wasdetrimental to me and my core values doyou guys remember yesterday I wastalking about emotions okay now keepthat in mind keep what I said yesterdayin mind my sister and I made the choiceto move out we moved in to an apartmentin Jersey City with another young womanI was a very nice apartment rent wascrazy but then again what isn't thesedays as far as awareness concern and thereason why we did it wasn't because youknow we wanted this apartment wasn'tbecause we felt like we were ready tomove out it was because I live in ahouse filled with so many people and myparents were just ready to you know forus to move move on with our lives and wemade the decision based off of not allwork emotions which is already bad butwe did it because we thought we wouldmake our mother and our stepfather happyby moving out not recognizing that thewoman that we were moving with moving inwith didn't share the same values thatwe shared and when I say that I meanthis woman not to put out on blastbecause I do know her she's not just afriend she's family so I can't go intotoo many details you would think that wewould be able to get along that thiswould be great when we were younger youwere luck we were very close but thething is something in my gut said don'tmake this choice some people it's calledtheir gut instinct some people like tocall it intuition I like to call it Godokay either my gut instinct or God andI'm feeling like that was what it wasthat's whoGod was telling me don't make thischoice it is not the best one it's notthe best choice to make for you for youto make or for your sister to make andyet we made it I already knew that Icouldn't trust this person she's alreadybeen she's already put both me and mysister in situations where it was notjust detrimental to our core values butdangerous okay this is this is a womanwho throughout our childhood has put usin very bad situations that's because ofthe lifestyle that she leads now as agrown woman she works a full-time jobthey're a great full-time job bringshome great pastries making more than meokay and my sister and she's in anindustry where money should be justmoving right she sells Broadway ticketsthis is my sister but again this womanthat we moved in with she was making ahell a lot more money on top of that shewas married to a man for the wrongreasons with great credit giving her anallowance so she was able to get thesecredit cards and buy whatever she wantedwell at the same time being ongovernment assistance so the perfectperson who wouldn't need assistance fromour government was still on assistancebecause she was finding a way to gameour system where she could beself-sufficient while also being adependent this is this is what she didmind you she had all of these things ather disposal and she still chose toleave the night life okay now those ofyou who understand what I mean you knowwhat the night life is okay and thatlifestyle makes me and my sister guiltyby association and that wasn't okay byme and the thing is we had fan thatlived upstairs from us and we asked themto assist us in kind of keeping thatworld out of our household and you knowwhat they told me and my twin sister ohI don't I don't want to hurt herfeelings I don't want to tell her thatour company has to go because you don'twant her to be mad at me you don't wanther to be mad at youhow about what she's doing downstairs isjust flat-out wrong it's morally wrongand legally it is just unacceptable Idon't care I don't care about herfeelings what she's doing is wrong I'mright she's wrong get this dude out ofmy apartment this is what we weredealing with in that place on top ofthatshe was more prone to violence than shewas to a conversationsound familiar people the left get veryviolent and it doesn't have to be aboutpolitics could be as simple as we livetogether and she doesn't would have aconversation this is what I have to dealwith that is what I had to deal with andI find and I realize that when you makedecisions that aren't best for yourselfyou unconsciously start to self-sabotagesituation that you are in because I didthat i self-sabotage that entiresituation because it wasn't best for meand I didn't know how to get out of it Idid so I was making the wrong choice nowfrom the jump-off I made the wrongdecision so every decision after thatwas the wrong one the life that I wasleaving wasn't matching what theDemocrats were saying saying that I haveto be ready to sacrifice my needs mywants my happiness for that of othersnow I'm all for being sympathetic forpeople and I'm all for you know tryingto help someone get off off on their getup on their feet but I'm over being selfsacrificial I'm not doing that anymoreyes I can be christ-like that is myright and my privilege as Lords creatorto become christ-like everybody has thatright and that privilege but you don'thave to be self sacrificial and Randsaid it best you do not have to do thatto be christ-like to be close to yourLord to be close to our Creator youdon't have to be self sacrificial and Irefuse to do that anymore I will nolonger abide by the ideology of theDemocrats never againI am liberated in my conservatism and Iam proud to say that no I'm notRepublican no I'm not Democrat and to befrank I don't think the American publicshould be either I think we should gobased off our gut instinct or based onour faith and listen to the facts thatare coming out of the mouths of thosewho are running for public office anddetermine which one is bestfor our society who is going to governus the best way and I don't want to hearthat hogwash about how this is the bestperson because he's black or she's awoman that is simple-minded and we can'tbe making decisions based off ofsimplicity this is some complex stuffand adults should be built and raisedand be prepared for that kind of choiceand if you are not ready to start makinghard choices in your own life then youare not ready to be making decisions inthat ballot box you were just not youneed to start opening your eyes like Idid okay because it's not just

which is the personal and often deeplymoving testimonials of people in thewalk away movement makes me depressedbut at the same time very happy strangeisn't itlet me explain the depressing part hasto do with the fact that I had been tothis before you see I was born and spentmy formative years in a communistcountry Poland believe me I know quite abit about lying media propaganda attackson those who dare to question the dogmathe profound disdain of the power leadstowards ordinary people all that werewitnessing in America today in thesummer of 1980 after long strike in thelargest shipyard in Poland the communistgovernment government agreed to thedemands of the workers which includedfreedom of the press it was a shock tothe system probably greater than theelection of Donald Trump was to thepolitical establishment in the US butthen in the months that followed somecosmetic changes were made but at thesame time the establishment got towarddiscrediting and destroying theopposition that had emerged -provocation violence in the barrage oflies the dissidents were called enemiesof the working-class traders of Polandand of course paid Stooges of the u.s.meddling in Polish affairs sincefamiliar doesn't accept meriteddissidents are rational thoughts as youmay know in December of 1981 thecommunist decided that they they hadenough playing games and imposed martiallawarresting thousands of dissidents andreversing all the reforms implementedafter that successful strike dark yearsfollowed with propaganda in overdriveand opposition moving to the undergroundthere is a part of me that dresssomething like this happening here maybenot exactly the same but now historyusually happens first a strategy atragedy and Dennis part thisstablishment the media the power leadsthe deep state are hard at work tryingto do undo what happened in the electionof 2016 they may yet succeed what fillsme with optimism and happiness is thatwe seem to be living in compressed timewhere everything happens more quickly soit may be that we are stepping over thatdreadful face and already moving to thenext one people walking away becausewhat finally broke the spine of thecommunist monster was tens of thousandsof young educated intrapreneurial polesliterally walking away escaping toWestern countries later tens ofthousands of East Germans whole familiesboarded overcrowded trains toCzechoslovakia where nobody stopped themwhen they crossed the border to WestGermany on footfinally ordinary people ridiculedoppressed threatened manipulated tooksledgehammers and smashed the Berlinwall that was one of the happiest daysof my life and frankly I never expectedI will get to relieve this in the UnitedStates I really thought that the deadlyviruses of Marxism and comewere eradicated like smallpox but itseems that they have just mutated intonew strains cultural Marxism globalistmulticulturalism the left's dream ofunifying the world into a totalitariansystem under the red banner had beenrevived the words being used havechanged somewhat we have a newvocabulary and new slurs for dissidentsof course but the approach remainedlargely the same lies distortionspropaganda political violenceintimidation the left at the moment doesnot have the state apparatus of violenceat their disposal thank Godthe king sent people to gulag confiscatetheir cars or evicted them from theirhomes because they found copies of allof us 1984 in them though those thingsactually did happen in communistcountries but they have other softermeans you may lose your job and thusyour livelihood

inrestaurants your children will be kickedout of daycare the clerk in the storewill refuse to sell you things you mayalso be physically assaulted by the wayall those things I just mentioned areactually being done to people today inthe United States of America and that'swhy this movement is so powerful itremoves a big part of the narrative thatthe left would have us believe that thisis just a bunch of crazies because whitesupremacists you know the basket of theclaw rolls or the people from MiddleAmerica whoclinging to their guns and their Bibleswho are standing in the way of theleft's total victory to see theincredible diversity of people heremen women black white brown young oldAmerican born immigrants bravelyannouncing the supremacy of reason overideology he would have to be totallybrainwashed to cling to your delusionthat these are Russian boats that'sactually an important pointwhy are otherwise intelligent people notable to see through the lies thatthey're being

in ahate fest this country had not seensince the Civil Warand Tifa the self-proclaimedanti-fascists are using the same tacticsand had the same goals a storm of tilingas are the brown shirt violent goons ofthe Nazi Party to intimidate silence anddestroy the opposition why doesn't thatstrike them as odd I blame it onideology ideology you see is falseconsciousness you do not see reality forwhat it is you see only what comes toyou through the filter of your ideologyit is like having implants in your eyesor your brain that allow you to seeeverything only black and white everyonewho tries to tell you about all thecolors out there you perceive as a liarora threat to your identity you want tosilence them by whatever means let mefinish on an optimistic note we have adifficult journey ahead of us andpowerful forces allow me to stop ourMarch but if history is any guide weshall overcome as Polish people say lieshave short legsthey can go only so far eventually thetruth catches up to them or walks awayfrom them I believe that we will emergehealthier and stronger as a society andthat the cancer of totalitarianismbut whatever name will again be inremission I bow before you by fellowworkers

hey internet people from the group Irecently joined the group and but I'vebeen part of the walk away not amovement but of the sentiment just likethree years ago a little bit aboutmyself I am a proud member of the LJ FGt vq p ia+community and also recently I found outthat I'm Latin eggs I didn't know whatit was but apparently it does that's mynew it's my new big team car and so I'mreally proud to be a member of this newmiddle term I try to wear it with prideI used to be a Democrat like most peoplehere in this group and mostly when Ilived in New York I lived there for fiveyears and you know as usual you live inthis bubble and and and it's so easy tobe a Democrat because everybody is andyou know at the time you know when Obamawas president and whatever you agreewith his politics or not it wasn't asobvious you know like the bias orwhatever they're doing right now itwasn't as obvious before so he didn'tfeel wrong to be a Democrat and now itjust feels completely wrong and and alsoat the time you know I wasn't a sportypolitically involved I didn't care muchand I realized that what you don't careor you don't know much it's just justthe easiest route because you can agreewith everyone everybody will agree withyou and you don't have to get into theconversations you just say however youfeel and you'll be fine so about threeyears ago a leader you know when thepresidential campaigns were going onI wasn't obviously I wasn't a fan ofHillary Clintonnever ever bought it for her and nevernever bought for her and I'm so happythat she didn't win but I I was not afan of Trump because again because ofhow Emilia was truly in a good time andbecause I not been as involved as I as Iwanted to be I wasn't as opposed to hispolitics and all I heard was hisrhetoric and so I wasn't convinced youknow it's like a magnet for someone justplace when they're saying cause itdidn't feel very convincing to me so I'ma I don't want to see the mistake but Ivoted for this this is my first timeactually voting in u.s. presidentialright and then I didn't want to not voteso I decided to vote for a third party Ibelieve for the cream pie for this timeand it wasn't because of herspecifically but just because of whatshe represented like I wanted to startearly supporting an alternative to thetwo parties that we have and you knowhopefully they eventually at least onthe local level that would create somesort of noise and open that ourpolitical environment for for a thirdoption which i think is going to happenespecially after Trump and so that'swhat I bought it for but when Trump gotelected I wasn't mad I wasn't you knowas dramatic suppose people were and infact I decided - okay fine so now he'sthe president now let me know what it'sall about and I started doing researchnice and look it exciting to look ateven his previous interviews like formany years ago and about his life andyou know he was I know it was acelebrity but I wanted to know what hispolitical views were before he even wasrunning for president and when I startedto look for information I realized likewait this doesn't match what the mediasays to be saying sosomething off here and which I cannotalways suspect it but but it was justnow so obvious and that's when I startedto not necessarily walking or being proTrump but at least being more aware ofthe situation and the manipulation andeverything that was happening and andit's like I'll is so funny because whenyou start like digging I need to getmore addicted and more interested in andthen you changed her the way that youlook at the world and they looked in theway that you look at everything in youwell I always been a cynic just bynature that's always been I always beenlike that I never I never you know whenI said I was a Democrat I wasn't reallylike a hard-core Democrat I'm not Idon't have that personality that we geta hundred percent behind something justbecause I'm always questioning I'malways like trying to to figure out whatthe secret agenda he's so pretty much acynic and that's the way that I look atevery aspect of the world so for me itwas a little bit easier to make thetransition and I did it very early I didit almost immediately after Tom gotelected and again I wasn't a how to playdoctor behind him but I was underpresent aware of what was happening andand so lately I and I always said youknow give it time give it time a lot ofpeople are gonna come around and a lotof people are gonna be exposed to thetruth and they're gonna wake up and Iactually was but I was a little bitworried because it was taking too long Imean it was been like two and a halfyears and I haven'tseeing a lot of change but I think thelast year or so I noticed more and moreyou know I noticed like with the blackseed with Kathy's Owens and now it iswalk away and I see a lot of people morewaking up a little bit so that'sexciting and I was like I feel like youknow when you have like a favorite bandand like you're a person that knows itand now it becomes popular and that'show I feltthree years ago and now I feel like ohmy god now everybody's like in my artistso it's very encouraging and that's whyI decided to finally make oh I nevermake it either I never talked about thisso jus like this you know I'm just not avery social media person and thenbecause I always say like you know who'sgonna be interested in whatever you haveto saybut for some reason maybe because my ACis not working and I'm dying of heat soprobably having his truck and I need torecord this video I and also because youknow I feel like it is important becauseI've seen a lot of what you guys havewritten in the in the group and yourvideos and in and I appreciate you knoweverybody like commenting on thesituation and I think it helps ifanything he helps me because to behonest it was pretty funny to talk toabout these things because I live inMiami now and even a lot of peoplesupport strong it's not like a lot of myfriends most of my friends are gay soobviously I automatically Democrats andthese are conversations that I did noteasy to have within I mean it doesn'tstop me from having them but I don'twant to become like like am i GOIwitnesses trying to convert into myreligion so it because it'll be limitingwhen the things that I want to talk toabout with them and which is a littlebit frustrating because sometimes I seesomething and for me it's obvious andthey defendwhatever their point of view and whatand the melius point of view and I'mtrying to like make it understand likewhat happened and it is a lost causeso I learn with time to to know my placeto know where I can say what I can sayand what people open to hear about thesetype of things and not push it and Ithink it's happening slowly but surelythe program more welcoming I want to beback to New York or world Pride so I metwith a lot of my friends from there andthey were they cannot believe I meanthey're very good friends and they werethey not for Tony I having had likethings happen like most people to theirfriends the song them and they lostfriends I never had that issue and Ithink this is part of what I wanted totalk about is because when you come onstrong when you feel like they know youif they're through with your friends youknow who you are they're not racist youknow that I cannot be a homophobic I'mnot as far back or not any of thesethings and so and they seem to talkabout certain issues only submitoffending some things that trauma saidor when they see me going against themedia narrative they know that itdoesn't come from like a place of hatetheythey don't understand it they lookat me like looking into my eyes liketrying to see if I'm still they hirecome on you because like the real Danielis there we can see it and they trulyare very confused but they're nice aboutit you know we talk about here and Ialways yeahSudama races or whatever horrible personI'm an [ __ ] fine and they respected Imean inI'm not trying to change their mindthey're not trying to change mine so Ithink it's very important it's havingthese type of conversations with peoplethat even that you don't agree with youdon't agree with them and but again justif they can see you're doing attentionthat's what helps them change their mindor release to to try to open the doorfor say like okay I I know Daniel and ifhe's interested in this really saying isthere must be a reason so let me try tofigure it out and and I had presidentagain they haven't come over to thenormals I took a common sense eyes thatI call that it's an active lab right nowit's like common sense and and someothers and more questions and we havelike a different type of conversationthey understand that on board with againthey're not gonna be hardcore contrailsanother Trampas main here but at leastlike open their eyes you know it's likejust understand the funny pollution thatis happening around you so okay this isvery long and I'm gonna try to learn howto edit so hopefully won't be as longand I'm not even sure if I'm gonna postit but if I do you obviously wouldn'tnotice and another thing that I wantedto talk about not necessarily going intopolitics into specific policies but oneof the reasons why when I talk to peopleabout for example about Trump why Isupport it at the moment and I say thatthe moment is because I'm not gonna 100%go behind him and and if tomorrowsomething horrible happens if he sayssomething that is it doesn't go with mybeliefs I'm not gonna defend it and thenthey're gonna pretend that I was never afan and that I was always a guy like I'mnot gonna just you know blindly supporthim you know I'm always aware of likewith any politician or anyand power you always have to bequestioning you know tilt what to beyeah just wear so I said now yes Isupport him and I like him and Iactually love everything that he saysfor some reason sometimes I wonder ifI'm a bad person I know if I'm brilliantnasty but besides all of that what I tryto tell people is that I like what he'sdoing to the culture like his his Ithink looking into the future 90 yearsfrom now we're gonna look back in 2000is seen as a pivotal moment in thehistory of the United States andpossibly the worldbecause I always tell people he's likethat like a break that we need it youknow everything was going towards onedirection like the way he really harlike to that and and he was gonnacontinue that way if Hillary came to waselected and then comes from and upsetand says okay you know when it's up alittle bit you know we are in thistransitional period instead of going onwith technology it opened up a whole newworld that as humans we're not evenprepared to barely understand and itbrought us all together and now we have87 genders and we have and we know whatsomeone in Africa it's doing whensomebody nations two wins and now wehave like we as empathetic how it'sgonna be we want to feel bad for someonethat we don't even know who they are inparts of the world that we didn'tunderstand so all of that creates thislike this imposition of ideas offeelings that humans were created toaccept yet so so I think Trump is like alittle bit stop in the road and and andin a disruption that will make us willevaluate everything and say ok finalistslet's see what's going on and then seehow we can move forward let's see whatwe can take let's see well come wait andwhat everything has to be happening awaynow nobody has to be upset till I had topresent you know like let's see let'stry to educate people was going on andsee how they react right so I thinkthat's one of the the biggest reasonwhen I like what was happening with himwhether I like him or not or would likethe police is not I think what he'sdoing I love what was happening in theculture in the political establishment Ihave a feeling I was telling my friendsthat is like you know but I was lookingat the Democrat debates which nobodyelse was like everybody's a Democrat andnobody watch the things I don't evenknow who they can buy and I'm supposedto be another possibility I'm a pepper Ifollow in everyoneand there are some candidates that I seelike you know and that is crazy and thehave some potential but I told them notto the candidates but to my friends it'slike ok so you had these people theywould be perfect for 2024 and it's likeknow why we need to get rid of drumright now it's like I'd give it anothermore four years with you we haven'the started destroying this is in a wayright now you know he has to dismantlethe Democratic Party as it stands rightnow he went the Republican Party as heused to be as a feeling now is changingand he's bringing a lot of people I canwalk to the center and I think that'sthe future of a third party like youwanna call it like a powerful party whenthe best of both parties we cometogether and now we're gonna have we'regonna have something that is races likeif you wanna agree with some fiscalpolicies and everybody can you erase itbecause then you have to agree witheverything else or vice versa you wantto care about some socialbeneficial ideas I mean you're like aprogressive a communist you know therehas to be like a common ground I thinkthat's gonna be there in 2024 we wouldprobably have the best question that wewill ever haveother than Trump and so I always saidlet's just wait look this way and bepatient and just enjoy the ridehopefully I'm not wrong I hope that Ilike in a year like he becomes the nexthipster and I will look like a fool andI will not need it at the time it'ssomething bad happens I would have madeit I was you know what this is what Ithought this is my opiniontoday in 2019 and it will change 2020based on what happened it's like youknow not gonna do what a color orDemocrats do now but even if they seethe truth even if they see whatever it'sgoing on and they don't accept itbecause they don't want to look likefoolsyou know after you criticize somebodyyou're even a group of people probablyclean how do you take that back and saylike oh you know what you were right Iwas behind I was stupid I wasn'teducated enough it takes a lot ofcourage to do that and that's why Iunderstand why other people who left orDemocrats are not doing it but I feellike it's gonna happen eventually itslowly but surely and hopefully so yeahso I think that the Trump camethe moment that he needed to calm andhe's well the country needed and it'sjust gonna be greatafter 2024 especially after 2020 becausethat if it gets reelectedwe pretty much proved that it wasn't itwas a fluke in the system it wasn't justpeople that didn't want a boat forHillaryit wasn't just people that didn'tactually vote because I persisted topeople didn't go both so if in 2020 thisreelected I think you would help peoplepay a little more attention is okay Ithink the country is trying to tell ussomething which we all listen well is Ihope that's the message that andespecially because moving forward thenthey're gonna have any platform as theelect in the common elections in 2020for their platform won't be I'm not fromso what for me they actually had toactually try and talk about Pollypolicies so I'm I'm excited to see whathappens you know with a were like yeahlike you watching I feel like I mean Iwant to sound like like we're I don'tknow how to call it but like I feel likeI'm always a little bit ahead of thetrend and I saw this three years ago twoyears ago and this is what I'm seeinghappening in the futurezoom thank you i solid for creatingwhoever forgot the name of the guy thatcreated this group the the walk awaymove manI think it's gonna help a lot especiallyof gay people and I let's see let's seeI don't know it feels really good totalk I wish I had some points beforehandor something like a little bit moreorganized way of doing this but this isliterally my first time ever recorded avideo and I feel very uncomfortabletalking to myself in the camera andknowing if my accent is too strong youthisit's gray but I I just wanted to try itI facili really leave a rating and I'mreally want to try to learn how to editand just live like so you know when youdelete YouTube videos if they do theseweird things that I need to learn how todo that but yes you know I'm reallylooking forward for everybody else'sstories how they work why why they thinkabout the world and I'm interested morethan in politics I'm more interested inlike the culture the culture and theimpact that all of this has in in eachof us and I try to look at positiveweight even though sometimes it's veryfirst slide him to see ends up likeanything yes yes I can I don't know howto like it just infuriated when it'ssomething I like for example whathappened yesterday with the tweet thatTrump will you know tell him thisCongresswomen to go back to thecountries in everybody saying that it'sa super race is and and again going backto I literally read it to you like 10times with differentglasses on you know like differentperspectives trying to see the racismand trying to see the bad bad you knowlike didn't yet I interpreted completelydifferent I mean it's a stupid to it inthe sense that he had from the UnitedStates which comes rather going back tobut I understood what he was trying tosay and especially because today's theday before yesterday I was having theexact same conversation with somebodyelseI have a business I have a restaurantand I was talking to somebody about howit annoys me when someone that it'snever hired restaurant does not have arestaurant I have never worked on arestaurant comes in and tells me how torun my restaurant and I always am a liardon't say anything I listened better Iwas telling this other person I was likeyou know open a restaurantimplement your ideas in that restaurantin Italy they work come here and shareit with me and I will be willing morewilling to listen I think andcoincidental you know today after throwntwist is that with this comment andthat's literally exactly how I put itwhich is like saying you know go back toyour country there again they're fromhere but let's assume like you can'tlike go to another country needs yourhelpand fix it and and then we talk we'd saywell your social is or whatever ideasyou spewing words in that country thatwas correct and unmanageable and in thelives away what we can begin the u.s.that's how I interpreted that commentI'm doing i didn't ENT races I didn'tsee any sexist and I thought nobodywould but I didn't see any media goingcrazy even people from there write acondemning andlike this is not this is inexcusablethis is whatever and I'm still thinkinglike okay maybe I am a bad personbecause I don't see anything wrong withthat comment um so yeah so if I'm a badperson for that please let me know thecomments because you know I'm alwayswilling to learn to change to be betterso yeah anyway I mean this is grataforever if I keep talking aboutdifferent subjects and my mind willstart rambling and doing many things soup to date a lot of you guys and you'rethe testimonies and keep in touch thankyou for having me in the group and thisjournalist let's change minds alltogether[Music]

well hello Patriots this is not quite mywalkaway testimony but today is November3rd which is considered as all survivorsday and as a victim advocate forsurvivors of human trafficking here inSan Diego California and also a survivorof abuse myself and as well a survivorof a cult I thought it would beappropriate to share this since today isthe day and also because as a walk awayyou know survivors or victims ofdemocratic party I thought it'll beagain appropriate to share thistestimony or this revelation rather thatI had so in one of my trainings twoyears ago for human traffickingmentorship training that one of thetrainings that I did as part of myvictim advocacy we learned about thisformula that dictators use to controlbasically their people and we use aformula to apply to also humantraffickers or as we know them on pimpsso when I thought about that formulakind of stuck with me and when I wasthinking about that today I realizedthat that's exactly the same formulathat the Democratic Democratic Party hasbeen or the Democrats have beenoperating based on and also calls youknow cult leaders abusive you knowpartners abusers and all those categorybasically use the same same formula andI thought about sharing that with youand and that's obviously hearing yourthoughts on thatso as I've listed on the caption herethe first thing they do to basically gettheir victims hooked they create aproblem so that problem is usually iffallacious a fallacy based propagandabase problem of the Quaid and which alsocreated some sort of confusion in theirvictims andthe next step they do once they createthis problem they immediately also offeror create a solution for that problemthey have this completely made upthemselves and then the third step is tocreate that confusion in the victim sohow that works is that basically let'ssay what Democrats we've seen them usingthis race car the racism or poverty youknow or things like that and this is thehistory you look back on all thedictatorships you know in the world theydo create this problem that's you knowmade-up problem and then they makepeople depend on the solution that theyonly have the exclusive holder of thatsolution for that problem and basicallycreate this you know confusion in thevictims and the people of thinking wellwe have a dependent them the classicexample with a lot of us have I've seenis in the classic book Animal Farm bythe author the British author GeorgeOrwell that basically it is toillustrate oh the dictatorship in theworld and all the revolutions that takeplace is to you know make this creatureas he calls them I think of this likeproblem with with that with the humanand we have to go at war with them allthat stuff so that's an example of howthe Kidder's create a problem soDemocrats for example have been creatingthis problem with racism look how theRepublicans are doing this and look atall this guns and all this shootinghimself so now we're gonna tell you thesolution is you know you got your kidsgonna be killed in school so we're gonnacreate the solution the solution is totake your arms away take your you knowfirearms away so they create thissolution and people get confused enoughwell you know we can see the problemexist because they created the problemto begin with we just found out therewas a training camp the Muslim you knowthe compound that was training this kidthis extremist Muslim kids to how to doshootings in school so you wonder who'sfunding this thing so anyway that's oneexample and racism another exact classicexample they always used look they'reracist and we have a solution you let usyou know rule and and we will get rid ofthat raceand that problem that fallacious youknow problem that I've created and sothe same way again as a victim of alsosurvivor of a cult culture it was thesame thing you're in this so-calledChurch and they're saying you knowyou're there's a problem and if youdon't follow this you know solution thatwould give you you're gonna go to helland your salvation is at risk and allthat stuff so again they they make youdepend on their their this solution theyhave created in you and let's mix withthis confusion that you struggle withbecause you're trying to figure out wellthis yeah I can see the problem and itmakes it you know believable anyway soI'm saying way abusive mentally abusivepartners use the same thing you have nofriends you need help sweetheart and I'mthe hero for you so as I've listed of acaption here the result of this formulais is that the victim becomes dependenton the exclusive solution that theseabusive cultish you know Democrats youknow dictators all of this categoryoffer and they think of the abuser as ahero which that's kind of the most thesaddest part about this this dynamic isthat they create they become actual herowhich you know often we call them asalso Stockholm Syndrome the left isstruggling with that well yeah let's letthis you know it's Seamus or illegals inand and despite knowing that they'vebeen harming you but you let kind ofconfuse you look with us there's aproblem and they're Democrats aretelling us that we have to take them inbecause if not it's not so anyway but wenot only we see that they're actuallyhurting us we actually see one of thoseheroes kind of help our communities andstuff so they actually promote that ideaso I thought about sharing this todayand hear your comments and your opinionsbut so it is a all survivors day and forour walkawaysI just want to encourage you to go outthere and vote at that you know I lovehow Brandontalks about you know the unsilent youknow a minority I think we're actuallydid the silent majority who has notbecome on silent um so we are majorityand I would encourage you to go out ontwosand you know exercise your rightsexercise your voice and and do not seeyourself as victims even though thesecategories that I've listed here aretrying to make us feel like we'revictims and they are the only solutionand help for us out there have it lastnight and I'm glad to be part of thisgroup
okay guys so this is this is my walkawaystory so I walked away from theDemocratic plantation out last year thebeginning the beginning of last year andwhen Donald Trump was first elected youknow I was just like everybody elsearound me you know I was just talking[ __ ] you know I was saying that wasgonna be a nuclear war you know he wasgonna round up the blacks and minoritiesthrow us all in the concentration campyou know I said you know I was justtalkin all type of ridiculousness matterof fact when he won I was in Cairo Egyptat the time and you know I was on mylaptop and I saw the news headline thatsaid president-elect Donald Trump when Isaw that I flipped out I just ran off Ijust started running all around the mallscreaming and young and so after thatyou know I you know I started to reallypay attention because I thought that youknow America was just going down thedrain right so I started a little payattention to what was coming from whatwas coming from top right and so he didsomething I can't remember specificallywhat it was but he did something and Isay you know what this is actually goodyou know say you know I could see howthis could benefit you know our nationour country I said you know I actuallythink this is really good and so I wentto someone who you know who I highlyrespected someone who you know I thoughtto be an intellectual someone who Ithought to be a rational thinking personand you know I basically pointed outthis what Donald Trump did and thisperson you know she just yelled at merelentlessly for our strength justbecause I pointed out something greatthat he did and so when that happened Isaid you know what I think that athinker I think a lot of people may bedoing the same thing I think a lot ofpeople aren't actually paying attentionto you know the positive aspects of thispresidency and what he's doingI think that everybody she's just sooverly concernedwith the negative aspects and if you saythe name Trump they having a whole panicattack a whole meltdown and so you knowI say you know what let me go trying todo some research on my own because a lotof stuff just wasn't adding up to meright and then one thing in particularlike you know they kept trying to tryand say that you know he was a racistbut I can recall you know then-double-a-cp giving him a rewardmultiple awards for you know for fordoing up for actually providing jobs inthe black community you know I canremember him sponsoring a lot of blackathletes and black events you know Imean back in the day he was our favoriteguy and you know also the you know theytried to tie him to the KKK but you know[ __ ] I'm from the south and I've neverknown of the KKK to like Jewish peoplenow mind you Trump's daughter is marriedto a Jew and the same Jew as advisingTrump's awesome hmm you know I've neverseen a KKK member that would allow a Jewto advise him let alone declareJerusalem the capital of Israel and saythis is one strange racist boy you knowso you know I was born at night but notlast night you know so I started toreally think about all that this type ofstuff and so I started to do my littleresearch and I saw it to look intoTrump's policies and the first thing Isaid to myself I said you know what Iactually agree with them but with themajority of these policies I think is Ithink he got some really really greatpolicies I think that these policies canbe a really good for our country and sobeyond that I started to really payattention to - you know - Trump himselfand you know how he was conducting forme he's a businessman like a businessmanand I saw him like conducting businessnow saying you know what this guy's he'sjust moving through every single policyall his campaign promises he's keepingit I mean this guy's literally he saidhe's gonna do that boom he done it hesaid it's gonna do this boomand we gotta be honest Barack Obama liedfrom the time he came in office to thetime he left out I mean he barely tookhe kept a few promises for a few peoplewho would look like they paid him wellbut Trump you know Trump had no in sensenobody was paying him he already had somoney you know he came in this thingshe's really ready to take care ofbusiness really working for the Americanpeople and that's when I started to seeand so I said you know what you knowthese guys are attacking him even evenwhen he was a you know about to meetwith Kim Jong hoon from North Korea Isaid wow you know this is this isabsolutely amazing you know it's likesurely like no but no one can findsomething negative about that and sureenough they could find everything theypossibly can or we don't think themeetings gonna go well thank you fineeverything they could say to try anddisparage Trump try and disparageanybody for me to support Trump and soyou know I did a lot of research Istarted to look into the history of theDemocratic Party I started to considerleadership of the Republican Party and Ifound out that there has been a hugehuge effort to hide the true history ofthe Democratic Party and you know Iwouldn't even deeper I've started tostudy you know the Soviet Union era andthe propaganda that's attached to theSoviet Union era and how they were ableto effectively you know subvert people'smind you know they use psychopsychological subversion of techniquesin order to and they do this through themedia through the education system inorder to completely change people'strains of thought in order to completelychange your mind and so I saw how thisassault liked the correlation with thesehyper tactics from you know from fromfrom the Marx I study the Marxist linenlinen philosophy socialism communism youknow where was socialism at andsocieties how effective was it you knowwhy did it why did it not work I studycapitalism I studied the wholecorrelation I could see directcorrelations between a lot of this stuffthat the Soviets with the propaganda andNazis are doing within the DemocraticParty which absolutely blew my mind andso then I said and another thing thatreally struck out to me was the the thedestruction of the black family due toliberal democratic liberal policies youknow prior to the 1960s less than tenpercent of black homes had a father in abowl and he look at modern day Americanow toast in 1960s post lyndon b jumpsliberal welfare state there's a there'sclearly a decline within within theblack family structure over seventypercent of black households do not havea father and it's all directly linked toliberal policies and when i reallystarted to look at because at this timebut prices I had no clue about politicsI didn't really understand nothing aboutpolitics but now when I go back and Ilook at all of the major cities you knowDetroit and all these things that shouldhave all these things that I ran downbaltimore these these are alldemocratically ran seats so you knowclearly the people who are run thesecities either they don't give a damn orthey're not capable of producing youknow of cities that's you know that'sthat produces like functioning peopleyou know it's and so for me you know ibecame clear that you know these peoplethey don't seem to have a care ofactually lifting minorities or anyoneout of poverty they just seem to have acare of assisting you while you areactually in poverty and so for me thisbecame evidently clear and it caused meto completely walk away i didn't evenwalk out ran my ass away ran my ass awayquick and so uh you know and of courseyou know when you come out and you sayyou uh you know you support Trump ofcourse you get a lot of backlash but forme I'm free baby I'm a thousand percentfree I'm not walking around thinking atthe white man's holding me down you knowI'm not walking around with these uhwith this liberal mindset I'm notwalking around seeing division andplanning to these identity politics andcolor and all that it's that we Americanstraight up and down American and Iremember at a time when it was it was itwas prideful to be American and now wesee people you know want to disrespectthe flag and all thisstop trying to say and you don't evenrealize like a lot of these cases thaty'all whooping in Ireland about I getthe same whooping and hollering and I'mtelling you I calmed down and I went andlooked into a lot of things and I'mtelling you we have been duped we havebeen hoodwinked to the highest order tothe highest order and so you know Ireally encourage you guys to you knowreally take it upon yourself do your ownresearch really look into the history ofthe Democratic Party because they arenot true they're betraying themselves tobe these are the people who wannaslavery these are the people who do notwant blacks to vote these were the KKKmembers and these are the true races sothat's my story that's my input again Ihope you look at it I hope you not justwalk away but run your ass away peaceyouokay guys so this is this is my walkawaystory so I walked away from theDemocratic plantation out last year thebeginning the beginning of last year andwhen Donald Trump was first elected youknow I was just like everybody elsearound me you know I was just talking[ __ ] you know I was saying that wasgonna be a nuclear war you know he wasgonna round up the blacks and minoritiesthrow us all in the concentration campyou know I said you know I was justtalkin all type of ridiculousness matterof fact when he won I was in Cairo Egyptat the time and you know I was on mylaptop and I saw the news headline thatsaid president-elect Donald Trump when Isaw that I flipped out I just ran off Ijust started running all around the mallscreaming and young and so after thatyou know I you know I started to reallypay attention because I thought that youknow America was just going down thedrain right so I started a little payattention to what was coming from whatwas coming from top right and so he didsomething I can't remember specificallywhat it was but he did something and Isay you know what this is actually goodyou know say you know I could see howthis could benefit you know our nationour country I said you know I actuallythink this is really good and so I wentto someone who you know who I highlyrespected someone who you know I thoughtto be an intellectual someone who Ithought to be a rational thinking personand you know I basically pointed outthis what Donald Trump did and thisperson you know she just yelled at merelentlessly for our strength justbecause I pointed out something greatthat he did and so when that happened Isaid you know what I think that athinker I think a lot of people may bedoing the same thing I think a lot ofpeople aren't actually paying attentionto you know the positive aspects of thispresidency and what he's doingI think that everybody she's just sooverly concernedwith the negative aspects and if you saythe name Trump they having a whole panicattack a whole meltdown and so you knowI say you know what let me go trying todo some research on my own because a lotof stuff just wasn't adding up to meright and then one thing in particularlike you know they kept trying to tryand say that you know he was a racistbut I can recall you know then-double-a-cp giving him a

[Music]hi guys so I've received lots ofmessages from friends who seem to be abit worried about me first of all so I'mfine I'm very goodand I don't know why they would beconcerned I mean I've only made like2032 posts in the past 72 hours nothingnothing unusual there right no it's beenthis past two weeks has been like anincredible learning experience that I'vekind of taken by the horns andit's been Wow like super interesting tosee some stuff that I'm seeing I wasalways this guy who's like I can't standto hear orange man speak he's a racisthe's a homophobe he's nasty and why didI think that because everyone said thatokay everyone repeats that over and overand over again and to think anythingdifferentlyoutside of that narrative is you knowyou are accused of being in the Klanpractically and so I started getting alittle bit suspicious when everythingwas happening with the current protestsright especially on the heels of twoweeks ago when people were trying to getthe economy back opened and all of myliberal friends were going psychotelling basically saying that thosepeople were like the worst humans on theplanet okay despite the fact thatthere's a 12% unemployment rateso then the black lives matter stuffstarted happening obviously we were allworried in terms of our concern aboutGeorge Floyd and the police brutalityissue and wants to address it so twoweeks ago you had everyone on boardreally wanting to address it and thenquickly things in places started turningturning violent okay so you have likethe 2/3 percent of people that were kindof messing it up for everybodyand I was pretty outspoken at that timeabout that I think probably some of youmight remember that and I am verystrongly against any sort of violentactionI only support peaceful protestnonviolent you know it's the only way togo and then like all of my liberalfriends are basically saying well youcan't tell black people how to mourn youdon't understand the black struggle yourwhite love a blob of a lot and okay likeI can understand that perspective Ithink because I've lived out of thecountry for so long now five years thatI can see things from a differentperspective because every single personI interact with is not white almost andso it really caused me to really startquestioning things and so then I startedreally exploring the other side to seewhat was happening on the other sidebecause I became a bit suspicious rightbecause suddenly you have theseDemocratic politicians who are basicallysaying take to the streets take to thestreets and Hillary Clinton Joe Bidenand all this kind of stuff and then youhave like Joe Biden essentiallyexploiting the dead body of George Lloydat the funeral in the campaign speech wehad a five-minute speech that he cameover the during that funeral and it isit selects election season and what I'mseeing is that the narrative that I livethrough and the lens that I saw ourpolitics happen through is really it's abogus narrative it's completely yes thatand that narrative suggests thatliberals or Democrats have a monopoly ondiversity and and that liberals are muchmore open-minded and I cannot say thatthat's the same anymoreit possibly used to be the case and I doknow that there were many liberal causesthat were supported by the DemocraticParty a marriage equality and thingslike that that we won and perhaps for aseason that party was more open-mindedbut I think we're seeing a big shift andI think it's happening among youngyounger voters so suddenly you have allthese people on the Left who arebasically saying you know you reallyhave to analyze your whiteness and allthis kind of stuff and they'repractically leading themselves for beingwhite which i think is well hasn't kindof think that's gonna help anythingthey're assigning each other readinglists and all sorts of stuffunderstanding their whiteness and justkind of silly stuff that's not necessaryand if you even say if you even pointout that there wait there's a lot ofdiversity on the other side people arelike working together and they're theylove their country and all this kind ofstuff they will basically call you aKlan member at this point and I've beencalled a Klan member this weekand what they're doing I think on theleft is living through this imaginarynarrative that everyone on the right isjust a bunch of clan members that's justnot true you know if you look at theunemployment rate for black Americait doubled during the Obama years it hasdipped to a low point now if you look atwhat if you look at the LGBT community Ican't say that Trump has done anythingthat is very homophobic or anything likethatyou have a couple of stories that comeout that the Left exploits such as theadoption thing you know that gay couplescan adopt no that's not true what he didwas he supported religious charities intheir right to make their own decisionsand that's freedom right that's howthings should work and I support that aswell and there have been in a coupleother instances like that as well andI'll tell you how the left ismanipulating the narrative so if youtake Trump's speech that he gave and Iguess it was the Rose Garden aboutGeorge Floyd and the protests that werehappeninghe gave this it was really nice speechum probably didn't write it mostpresidents don't write their ownspeeches but it was a very muchsupportive of peaceful protest and thisissue and we're gonna solve it no onedeserves to do it this kind of thing andit's a problem and all this kind ofstuff right but he said that he wouldn'tlet the few violent people distract fromvoices of the people who are working tocreate change and that's when he came upwith curfews and things like that andbringing a military cuz he doesn't wantit to turn into this you know thingthat's gonna destroy the wholeinitiative well next that day thensuddenly there are articles coming outthat saying that Trump you know GeorgeFloyd would be proud of the job numberswhich was something that Trump mentionedat the very end of his speech as like anaddition kind of thing right because hewas reporting other a couple of ourthings that happen as well so you lookat the speech you can see that the leftis creating these narratives and at thispoint I can no longer support themadness that is on the left you knowthey have you basically the the languagecontrol the lack of free speech the lackof honest and respectful discussionsbetween the twinning groups and at thispoint is incredibly patronizingtoI think to black Americans it'spatronizing to just in general becauseon the other side you you you see thatthere are lots of people workingtogether already waiting for people towork together right but you have thesepoliticians who continue to drum up thisthese narratives you know that allRepublicans are racist folks and allthis kind of stuff finis it's just nottrue it it seems that the DemocraticParty has founded itself in the pastseveral decades on identity politics andit continues to kind of fragment itselffurther further within those identitypolitics and a lot of it is just likethis imagined reality that people areliving through but if you go on theother side and I've had so manydiscussions this week with you knowLatinos and black Americans and womenand LGBT people and regular straightpeople who support Trump and they'repretty much welcoming anyone to likework together you love your countrygreat let's respect each other let's putdifferences aside you know all thesekinds of things that I'm not seeing onthe left at all and in fact they're justpushing more and more people out soanyway so I want to get on here and saylike what I've been seeing I think we'reseeing a real generational politicalshift happening in our political historyI think we could potentially be settingourselves up for 12 years of Republicansparticularly if the Republicans becomemore and more diverse which I think it'shappening the Democratic Party can no itcan't really they're they're campaigningon something that is unsustainablebecause diversity and acceptance and allthis sort of stuff really is happeningat this point on the right and you knowparticularly among young voters theydon't care about young young girls don'tcare about marriage like that's finea marriage equality anybody gets marriedyou know whatever we love you know we'rehappy to support you regardless of yourrace in terms of immigration it's likeyou know everybody's forward immigrationbut they just want a legal path toimmigration but I'm seeing happen I'mseeing way more respectful discussionshappening and then like you haveliberals right now particularly mygeneration who are bashing each other'steeth dead over how you talk about blacklives which is what like why are youcontrolling the narrative to begin withright and ultimately I see most of thatis being involved with them and theiregosso anyway so it's been a reallyinteresting couple of weeks I've heardI've taken a lot of heat and ultimatelyit doesn't matter because I think thathad to be like honest about what youfeel and what you believe and all thatkind of stuff but I think that we'regonna see aa growing sense of inclusion on theright you're continuing to see that it'shappening and what that means for thefuture of the Democratic Party I don'tknow like it seems um what are theygonna do they're gonna run on democraticsocialism you know what do they want todo and you can't continue to explainexploit race race politics ororientation politics at this pointbecause those are kind of worn outthey're done in the sense of you knowequality is never going to be achievedhasn't been achieved but we're workingtowards it and there's much more of asense of harmony on the other side atthis point and respectful discussionshappening and I've looked into all thecases where people will say you knowlike Trump is this race that's both andall these kind of stuff and I started todig behind the narratives that are beingconstructed on the left because this iswhere they repeat themselves over andover and over again until they believeit that's like an echo chamber that theylive it and I lived it too I did it foryears I assumed I bought into it Iassumed if that was the case maybe itwasn't that time I don't know but I'mjust not seeing the I'm not seeing theclosed mindedness all right so I'm happyto take a switch over anywayI wanted to explain this kind of stuffbecause I kept having people reach outto me and like do to you have you lostyour mind you know all this kind ofstuff like no it's like it's been asuper interesting learning experienceand honestly it feels like quiteliberating because you don't feel likeyou know you don't have other liberalsscreaming at you like your whitesupremacy is a problem like whatseriously what no like that it's justabsolutely nonsense you know I'm happyto work alongside anyone who loves theircountry and respects one another and allthis kind of stuff and more and moreblack Americans are starting to turn itover to the right you're seeing a lotmoresee people as well you're seeing manyLatinos at this point who want torespect the legal immigration processthey don't want to open a border becausethat's a slap in the face to them whohave done the thing do have doneeverything correctly and properly Iagree with them I mean I've livedoverseas for five years I've had all mydocuments checked like once a month youknow that kind of stuff so anyway superinteresting stuff happening I think it'sexciting and I think that we're at areal political shift in our history Idon't think a lot of people are seeingit yet I've been studying this kind ofthing ever since my dissertation yearsthis kind of social shift happening andso it's starting to kind of cometogether at this point which is why I'vereally jumped on that train so all rightI hope you guys are all doing well Stacy

hi everyone my name is mark mark MontanaI'm an artist I made portraits and I'm agay man I'm 53 years old and that meansI sort of and I knew I was gay threeyears old so what that means is you knowI was attending school in the 70s whenit was still quite fashionable andcommon to you know the word wasword regularly I personally was deemed amy very first day of school andmy talent for art made me kind of highprofile so that everyone knew who I wasand they hated me and I sufferedunspeakably during my school years beingbullied every single day of my lifehaving students as well as teachers callme you know it's just it was itwas painful I you know got migraineheadaches and threw up constantly it wasI was awful but all this to say that Iunderstand what it's like to feelmarginalized and ostracized I know thatfeeling and I don't wish it on anyone soI'm very sympathetic to that playsimilarly and this sum what matters isthe you can't really see but I guesslike that's a drawing I did of my motherthat's a painting I'm working on of mymother my mother is was a very verybeautiful woman who had polio shecontracted polio as a child and eventhough she was as strong as an oxand could you know sort of I literallysaw her up through the tree one timebecause she didn't like where it wasplaced she just dug up a huge a big treelike a Christmas tree kind of tree dugit up and just moved it yet she claimedshe could not work or hold the jobbecause of her polio and so I saw whatpeople would refer to as the entitlementmyand how it warps the it sort of corruptsthe character because my mother had thisarrogance that she remember one time shehave to be recertified and she kind ofhad this fit saying you know how darethey make me go through this where's mycheck and I thought even as a teenageryou didn't work for this money how dareyou think that people owe you somethingand so I based much of my character andopposition to that what I founddespicable about that so as an artistfor example it's very common manyartists pursue grants they almost make asecond career out of grant proposalwriting trying to get money from thegovernment or corporations to fund theirtheir work I am offended though that fora living she offered me her services forfree and I refused them because my ownfeeling about it was I do if I cannotmake this work on my own with my talentwith my drive and I you know can work 18hours at a stretch no problem I I worklike a pack mule myself have a very goodwork ethic if I can't parlay that intoyou know financial independence I don'twant to be subsidized by the governmentthat's my own failing and I should beheld accountable for that so I've alwayshad that kind of an iron Randianlibertarian bent about that kind ofthing on the personal level even thoughI might have been more sympathetic towhat other people need help I will saythis again forgive me for all thetensions I had to go back to Florida in2016 to help my mother through a sort ofdifficult time she was hit by a car andbecause I didn't really have financialmeans myself I was scrapped I tend tobuy a car and get new partner all at onetime I found myself living in what hadformerly been low-income housing eventhough it was right onHillsborough River in Tampa and what theview was astonishing you know like aten-foot ceiling with a 14-foot glassswirling purse like this proscenium thatsort of looked out on the HillsboroughRiver it was a stunning view which wouldhave been you know a lot of money in abetter market but because it was in aneconomically depressed neighborhood therents I think I was paying $1,000 amonth for a one-bedroom and the womandownstairs to me where the identicalview was paying 500 a month and she hadlived there for seven years it had beenlow-income housing and like let's say atleast one third of the tenants there gotwere on government assistance of oneform or anotherand what I discovered was that it's veryeasy to sort of have this idea of thosewho are in need and on governmentassistance when you look at them from adistance but when you actually seepeople sitting on their balconiessmoking cigarettes and just sort ofpassing the time while watching TV whenthey are fully able-bodied and choosingnot to hold jobs because someone else ispaying for it and I was killing myselftaking care of my mother and working ajob and I think one week I paidsomething like eight hundred dollars intaxes and I thought I just paid thiswoman's rent and my own for her you knowit's just the way that that breaks downand she had no sense she had anarrogance about the woman downstairs forme that you know how dare they try toraise for rent she'd been there sevenyears and I even said I was like wellyou know you've had seven years in arental property someone else has boughtthe building now they wanna they want todevelop it and turn it into somethingyou know maybe it's time for you to moveon no there's no guarantee that youshould be allowed to live here for therest of your life at low at $500 a monthso I really started to see you know Idid I was already having this separationthen I had an up unto red pill momentsand again my walkway story could beabout you know the failings of theDemocratic Party but instead I choose tolike it's really about these personalinteractions I had which I've now founduntenable with people former friends ofmine on the left and the far left who Ithink have just lost their collectiveminds and none of those retro momentswas in 2015 I believe it was and they'rejust woman we had to mealyshe is the woman Sandra Bullockportrayed in the film The Blind Side thewhite woman from I think Texas orsomething like that who took in a blackyouth who maybe was an orphan I don'tknow but he ends up being very well forhimself we became like a footballsuperstar under the tutelage and sort ofshe taught him her more she gave him hermoral compass supposedly so apparentlywhat happened is these two young blackboys went into her fast food joint andwithout buying anything they sat down ina booth and started charging theirphones and sat there for quite a longtime until she opened we pulled up achair and sat down because it come onkids what's going on here and they toldher well we're we don't have enoughmoney we want to go to the basketballgame or something like thatand we only have three dollars and weneed six dollars so we're waiting forexample to bring the money and you knowhe wouldn't mind to be like to chargeour phones and rather than kick them outfor vagrancy which she would have beenboth within her right to do she gavethem food she gave him $20 each and saidthe only thing I ask of you is that youpay it forward and help somebody elsewhen they are in need and then she tooka photograph of the boys and posted itto social media now I can see how thiscould be construed as self-promotion andeven to a certain degree exploitationalthough these kids were practicallyadults these were like 16 17 year oldboys who were you know they will willcertainly kids are always all oversocial media promoting themselves so butthis blogger who might shallcharacterized as a overweight lesbianyou know mixed race feminist poet s-typehad an online blog if she wrote a viralblog piece demonizing Liane TV for herwhite savior complex and there was justsuch frothing racism within this piecethat I found myself going to theoriginal blog post and it's not onlythat I was offended by her perspective Iwas offended by how poorly the piece waswritten it was just it was I think shewas like the same word in three can saysentences and my snarky comment was doesshe need to buy a vowel or let's say aclue because this is not how aprofessional writer would have addressedthis and I immediately find myself beingseized upon and savaged by that writerherself and her friends who you knowwe're calling me an which that'skind of fair I am a bit of anum but also you know their most damningindictment of me was that I was a whitemale your white male and you'reprivileged and shut up and I thoughtwell I'm a white male but I you know I'malso a gay white male who have stuff whohas suffered more than my share ofdiscrimination and marginalization forthat and I was gobsmacked and deeplyoffended and hurt that all that pain andsuffering I endured as a kid was justdismissed as well it nothing becauseyou're white and you don't know whatit's like to be black it's like so we'regoing to now consume to know what mypain was I mean that's a very individualthing and by the way I find thisinteresting although I was constantlybeing bullied for being gay and you knowstudents and teachers would call meevery single day it did notreally occur to me that the reason forit was me being gay I knew I was gaythey knew I was gay but I thought it wassomething else something about mepersonally so I internalized it inprobably the most unhealthy way andthought well there's just somethingabout me I'm broken I'm defective andthey just don't like me because therewere other kids who were far moreflamboyant than myself and um theydidn't get bullied in the same way I didand then around Slevin 12 years old itwas so that I could no longer stand thebullying and I found that I did somesort of twist in my mind where I foundmyself working it and like doing thingsdeliberately to encourage it because Ithought now I can take it I canphysically defend myself I becamephysically very strong if anyone everfought me they lost like immediatelybecause I could throw quite a punch andthen I went on to find myself defendingother bullied people because I could notabide bullies andcontinues to this day and I see most ofthe bullying today coming from theDemocratic Party they just will nottolerate somebody who disagrees withthem they get so aggressive and abusivethe moment you challenge their beliefsthat you're called every conceivablename and so I find myself having lots ofonline brawls with people and defendingyou know whoever is the subject of thatweek's Internet mom you know whetherit's somebody who parked in ahandicapped space or it's you knowwhatever it is I just think it's out ofcontrol so all that to say my red phonemoments that lead to many thing was oneanother was my support for BernieSanders I was rapidly in Bernie's cornerI think the primary was stolen I stillsay it was stolen by Clinton and the DNCum I think Howard Dean tweeting you knowhe's from Vermont Bernie Sanders won 80%of the primary vote in in Vermont andHoward Dean was a super delegate whosaid I'm still not gonna vote for himbecause I don't have to it's not my jobto represent my constituents I'm gonnavote my conscience Wow the temerity ofthat still shocks me to this day but ofany rate uh there was the Sanderscampaign and at the time I see useFacebook as kind of like an online diarylet's say I would write long-formconfessional biographical pieces whichsome got like wide circulation like Imade a Bernie Sanders video which aboutover four million hits so that it youknow I was really in Bernie's corner andI have about fourteen hundred Facebookfriends let's say many open gay lesbiansmany of them left and far leftprogressives and happy wanted tochallenge me on my my endorsement ofburning all they need to do was ask meabout his his plan for Medicare for allor healthcare for all how would that getpaid for I believe that itphilosophically I could make theargument but you know let's say in acivilized society we do not want to livein a society where citizens can becomeso desperate to save themselves and thelives of their child that they can'tafford health care that they might beforced to do illegal things just to makethose just to get the funds forso even from a selfish perspective Ithought that to be argued although Icouldn't say how you would pay for itand I didn't feel Bernie can answer thatquestion either so I have anyone everwanted to challenge me on endorsingBernie that would be all they need to dobut instead they didn't do that theyjust I was routinely called anokay an and a misogynist and aracist because Hillary had the blackvote sewn up and to not endorse her wasa kind of racism apparently Wow imaginethat endorsing the white man over thewhite woman made me a racistokay so then there was that and so thesemoments is like chipping away one by oneRajasthan and I predicted Trump's winbecause Hillary did nothing to put theBernie contingent when she did finallyget the nomination and in fact she wascourting centrist Republicans when shehad the Bush family nomination she kindathumbed her nose at the Bernie Sanderssupporters and so it was very obviousshe was not going to win that theyweren't going to turn out for herbecause they were angry rightfully soand so I've heard it I was like lookdon't like me when Trump wins becausethat's going to be what happens I didn'tsupport Trump I didn't like him Ithought he was coarse and vulgarI didn't however see him as the racisthe was suddenly being portrayed as thisindictment never came up before and nowsuddenly he's Hitler and so for exampleand when somebody like Anderson Cooperand Joy Behar when I would see themtweak a word misquote him by one wordall Mexicans he said all Mexicans areracists no he didn't he didn't say allhe made a point in eloquently andclumsily if effectively and but to seethe the willingness of people to lie inorder to make that point I found it tobe offensive so then I didn'tnecessarily support Trump I will sayI've come to respect his ability to holdCenter as he is daily hourly minute lyvilified demonized for things he did anddid not say and he does not seem totolerate even one iota of lying abouthimself he fires back and I kind ofrespect that he'smy respect for that reason alone andalso I think when you have everyone inthe establishment the rep the left andthe right and the media against you it'spossibly because you are you know aspoiler for the establishment so I foundthat interesting as well at any rate butI didn't really support Trump certainlynot publicly because I thought it's justto polarize these times and I liked tobe a bit of a flame thrower but then Idon't like to really hurt people and Ithought well you know everyone hatesthem so I'm just gonna see what happenswith this one and I've seen Trumpderangement syndrome in people like I'venever been able to wrap my brain aroundit's such a an unabashed craziness ofpeople and the willingness to believethe most insane stories I personallynever bought the Russian collusion storyI had seen the video or heard the leakedaudio of Seymour Hersh the PulitzerPrize winning reporter behind Watergateand the My Lai massacre um I had heardhis leaked audio where he spoke aboutthe DNC letha the DNC operativevolunteer Seth rich who died who wasmurdered on the streets of DC he was infact the DNC leaker he the WikiLeaksleaker and that the Russian collisionstory was a hoax cooked up by former CIAdirector John Brennan and the DNC andthe Clinton campaign and that he he knewthis and so and then there's also the ofproject Veritas a hidden camera video ofVan Johnson claiming that Russia was abig nothing burger and of the CNNproducer claiming that they knew thatthere was no real proof of the Russiancollusion story but yet they hyped itnight and day because it was a cashedout for them so but no one seemed tocare about that they just just went onunabated he's a you know he's a what isit a sort of men Sheree and candidatefor the for the Russians I found thisstuff fascinating now cut to more recentevents there's the sort of justiceMillette thing and the covington boyscoming to voice these two events withthe straws the collectively the strawsthat broke my camel's back but with theCovington boys even before I had seenthe unedited video when they were whennot even I believed that they were theselittle entitled weasels who justwent down and harassed a poor elderlyman even when I thought that was thecase I still thought it was unseemlythat adults people of my generation weredaxing children and I remember thinkingcan you just be an anymorewithout having your life ruined must youlike you know for one youthfulindiscretion you should be kicked out ofschool and not be able to get a job itjust seems insane to me but there was nosense of proportion nor justice in thesepeople's minds it's like let's destroythese people's lives for what lookingsomeone in the eye were that smirk onyour faceobscene perversion of justice in myopinion and then it turns out by the waythey didn't do it they really victimswell what do you know whether there wasa Jessie smell that thing and of courseI never believed that story either justto find logic they you know just peoplewho would just happen to be likestalking him or lying in wait at 2:00 inthe morning and he just happens to goout to get a sandwich it's a ridiculousstory and of course it didn't hold waterand soon enough the world was saying hewas a liar so I didn't need to but afriend of mine on Facebook a girl withwhom I worked a knew the epitome of theyou know white guilt complex socialjustice warrior always you knowscreaming about the patriarchy and youknow evil old white men even though sheherself is white and you know she hadposted something about justice Millettestating rebuked with him and thankswomen I found myself almost wanting todefend him again because I felt like wowthis kids really everybody hates thiskid and I said something like I will saythis though I almost liked what he didborders on terrorism though because hemight very well have triggered a raceriot you know it's a we're in verydelicate times right now and it doesn'ttake much for that kind ofmisinformation to trickle down into thewater supply be consumed by the generallow information idiot who then reactsand reacts violently and so from frommaking that comment afraid ofa black woman from Texas just went formy jugular and called me an in aclown and a racist because when a blackman does what Jesse does he should becharged with terrorism yet when ryanlochte did it he was fine and of courseit wasn't fine but Ryan likely did butthen he didn't do what just he's electedhe told a stupid light to cover his asshe did not make up a lie for thepurposes of self-promotionwith no regard for the consequences orthe live scene oh look the life thatmight be damaged as a result for themovement but he purports to care aboutso I didn't see those things as beingequal and then I suggested that thiswoman was herself the racist because shethinks that my being a white male is thereason I would that I would have madethat comment again just just see a blackman it's ludicrous and for me he'ssuggesting she was the racist Wow thegirl that I considered a friend wentapeshit crazy on me called me ansaid I the trash should take myself outit was like my legspainful it is painful to see people thatyou know who know you and should knowyou just be able to summarily dismissyou demonize you dehumanize you you aredismissed you are non person you ceaseto existgo away I'm blocking you that process Imean I shouldn't bother me but I'm humanbeingit hurts it sucks and it sucks to be youknow 53 years old and I've already losta significant amount of people includingmy only sibling to AIDS and now I amlosing a significant number of friendsto political differences which we shouldbe able to discuss rationally butthere's just no rational dialogue anylonger things have gotten so polarizedso vitriolic that it's it's kind ofreached a fever pitch and I'll end withthis one thing that I find fascinatingmyself oh I think this one thing I findfascinating gays and lesbians and againI came up in the 70s when I suffered asmuch as anyonecertainly not maybe not as much aspeopleearlier generations like you know but Ididn't have to worry that I was gonna begiven electroshock therapy for being gaybut I have to worry daily about beinghave the beat out of me and like Isaid it wasn't today's you have it socomparatively easy I'm not saying it'seasy but it's certainly easier than Ihad it but yet they are constantlycongratulating themselves for theirbravery and it's like it doesn't you youknow what bravery try being hairy heythe founder of the matching society inthe 50s when his life was on the lineyou know he sort of doubly he foundedthe Mattachine revue met it's like asort of an underground gay newspaper ata time when being gay was considered amental illness and you would lose yourjob you know these were bad times so tosee the cell and the the fever-pitch ofpeople who make it sound like they'rethey are under the worst assault everthey've lost the narrative they lost theplot so to see that what I findfascinating is a gays and lesbiansweren't just fighting for the right tomarry essentially they were fighting forthe right for all of us gay and straightto have the freedom to express ourselvesand explore our sexual personas and thatmight even include refuse or whatever ittakes I mean my own personal philosophyis life should be the biggest experienceyou can make it that includes good andbad you know pain and suffering as wellas happiness I want to have the biggestexperience of life I possibly can henceI've lived in different countries I'vemoved around the ton and had differentjobs I had what I considered I like thelose weight and gain weight because Ialmost like to live in other people'sskins and have as varied a lifeexperience as I possibly can I just wantto know what it feels like to be otherpeople maybe and just expand that and soanything in that pursuit I think usuallylesbians you know we're fighting for theright to you know if you want to be aslave and sleep in a cage at the foot ofthe bed and have yourmasterpiece on you that's your right andI support that so when I find thisteracle is now having secured much muchof those rightsthe enemy has gotten smaller suddenly itwent from being a government oppressionto micro aggressions and bought crimesthere's that but then there's also thefact that the oppressed have become theoppressors the gays or lesbians now haveturned their focus to toxic masculinityof the sin and the sexual aggressivetendencies of the white heterosexualmale I thought wow it's so funny huh nowyou want to micromanage someone else'ssexuality with you yourself fought forthe right to be what you want to be so Ifind that hysterical I also find theunholy alliance between gays andlesbians and sort of radical Islam to bebaffling and offensive you know inChicago for example worthy one is if thegay and lesbian Israelis were bannedfrom the gay pride parade because theywanted to display the Israeli flag andso the gays and lesbian organizers ofthe parade banned them in solidaritywith the Palestinians I find thishysterical and intensely baffling thatyou know they sort of and the idea oflike sort of challenging the beliefs ofIslam is considered Islamophobia I alsofind this interesting I don't seeanything wrong with generalizing maybeit's a kind of if you only want togeneralize about race but when someoneis a member of a religion what they aresaying is I wish to be identified withthis group and this ideology I believein the things that this group believesin so I don't know why it would be wrongto then extrapolate a kind ofgeneralized persona of somebody becauseyou've already said I wish to beidentified with this group therefore andit's a belief system so I don't seewhat's wrong about sort of assumingcertain things about people you maybeguess it varies on the individualbasis but again the numbers of peoplewho throughout the world moderateMuslims who believe that you know thepenalty for apostasy apostasy ought tobe death or that you know the penaltyfor homosexuality should be deaththe numbers are shockingly high butthat's you know something for anothertopic this for someone of a greater mindthan my own to tackle but these are myown stories of why I left the left I'mconstantly finding myself being vilifieddemonized written off from people Ireally cared about it's a painfulprocess and it sucks but it's uh it'sthe reality of the times that we live inand I I guess I he's suffered and I wasable to tolerate being ostracized as achild when I was far less sophisticatedin my defence systems than I am now asan adult so I suppose if I couldtolerate it then I will again tolerateit it sucks and I don't have make anyqualms about that it stinks but that'sthe reality of it so I bid you all agood daywatch Candace Owens the girl I get havemad respect for that girl and herability to again speak reminded fights II wish I had like one ounce of hercourage thank you guysyou
hello I want to tell you why I left theDemocratic Party it all started in the2016 presidential election I I had madeup my mind that I was not going to votefor Hillary because I didn't like herever since her husband left the WhiteHouseshe seemed that she wanted to remain inthe political environment and she didnot just stay in one position but shestarted climbing up the ladder and itall seemed that she didn't want to stopuntil she got to the very top thatshowed me well that's or is what Iperceived it was that she was not thereto help people but rather to acquirepower that's why I didn't like her and II made up my mind I was not going tovote for her regardless of who was theopposition in this case it was DonaldTrump and so I said I will vote forDonald Trump before I even listen to anyof the things he had to say in thedebates when he started the debates andhe started speaking up about his ideasand his beliefs of what is needed in thein this nation I really liked what hesaid I supported what he was saying Isympathized with that and so even moreso I said sure I'll vote for this guybut in the meantime every time you sawanything on the mainstream mediait seemed that everyone forecasted thatHillary was going to be the winnerand an anyone who suggested that maybeDonald Trump could win wasn't made funof they make joke about it and then alot of celebrities and even the thepresident at that moment Obama he evensaid that he could only imagine DonaldTrump as the President of the UnitedStates in an SNL skit that's a TV comedyshow that to me didn't seem right at allfor a president to make fun and toridicule people running for presidencylike like they were garbage to me itdidn't seem right and even though themedia the mainstream media projectedthis ideology that Hillary was going tobe the winner I still continue with mydecision to vote for Donald Trump evenif I thought he was going to lose butthen the election day comes and he winsthat was the moment that opened up myeyes because before the election themainstream media made everyone believethat the Donald Trump had no supporterswhatsoever that he only had like ahandful of supporter who were likedelusional mental deplorable but itwasn't true more than half of the votingpopulation supported Donald TrumpI was not alone they made me believethat I was alone they have beensuppressing they've been making surethat nobody knows that Donald Trumphis beliefs his ideas he is conservativeideas have many many many supporters whydon't they want to show that I tell youwhy because if anyone belonging to adifferent political party different thanthe Republican Party independent partydemocratic party any other politicalparty if anyone is caressing the leaningtowards conservative ideas which I'msure they have because I was aregistered Democrat but I hadconservative side conservative ideas Ijust didn't know itif anyone hears anyone on TV in the newsin TV shows showing that there arepeople who support Donald Trump's ideasconservative ideas it could be anybodymaybe it wasn't Trump it was somebodyelse who came up with this conservativepoints of view then people who arecaressing their leaning towardsembracing the Republican Party orconservative ideas in general then theywill completely embrace it it will notbe just an idea that they want toembrace this ideas no they willcompletely embrace it and the momentthat Democrats could lose a lot ofsupporters because a lot of people areconservatives they just do not know itand the mainstream media is tryingdesperately to make sure to make anyeveryone believe that they are themajority that they are the the ones forthe people the Liberals that we want toinclude everyone but there are a lot ofpeoplelots of gay people who have conservativeideas black Americans a lot of blackAmericans have conservative ideas andthey're afraid just to speak up becausethey're afraid that are going to belabeled sellouts the media is not beingfair it's not showing people's ideasfairly they don't want to include uswhen they speak of diversity they don'tmean diversity in ideas they meandiversity in appearance black whiteyellow sexual orientation but if youhave different thoughts you're notincluded you mean it's instead youyou're being made fun of half the nationis laughing at conservatives the jokesin the mainstream media it's only forhalf the country it's not the wholecountry's only for half the countrybecause the other half is not laughingwe are being labeled as the plural ballsthat's why I walked away from theDemocratic Party because they don'tinclude everyone they have an agenda butit's not to include everyone only theones who think like them that's why Iwalked away I have been a conservativeconservative all my life I just didn'tknow it until the 2016 election that'show naive I have been but no more I amwalking awaythink about it open your eyes thank youfor listeningyou

um this is my walkaway video and I justwant to tell you a little bit about mybackground and why I'm going public so Igrew up very Catholic and a Catholicfamily on the East Coast and I alwaysloved my Catholic faith even wanted tobe a priest when I was little I alwayscared about justice and would alwaysspeak up for justice in any scenario foranybody who seemed to be treatedunjustlyI became gender dysphoria at an earlyageand didn't affect my life in atremendous way but it was challengingand I went on to enjoy public school fora while and I say enjoy but really I gota lot bullied and I went to a CatholicHigh School after that and where I founda lot of good treatment and it felt likehome and people considered you as ahuman being as a holistic human beingrather than just an object that they hadto teach which is what I had found inthe public schools in that area where Iwas which was in Delaware I applied toWest Point and was nominated to WestPoint by Joe Biden actually and this wasan odd blip on an otherwise very radicalleftist what would you say radar andwhen I was in high school after I hadapplied and while I was gettingnominated I actually went to a religiousretreat and it moved me a lot one of thethings they showed was a filmstrip ofthe children in Vietnam being bombedwith napalm and the kids you knowrunning you know with their naked bodiesor with having had napalm on their skinand it it really made me veryit repelled me it repulsed me the ideaof joining the US military after I'dseen that and also Reagan got elected atthat time and everybody was telling itall you know Tracy it's so great you'regonna go to West Point so I gotnominated to the West Point by Joe Bidenbut I had a lot of misgivings when I sawa religious retreat video that showedwhat was being done to the children inVietnam or what had been done and sowhen I was having those misgivings thenRonald Reagan was elected and peoplewere saying oh Tracy this is reallygreat that you're gonna be going to WestPoint because they're gonna get a lot ofmoney and I was never really into moneyand I was really troubled I was likethis is not great this means we're gonnago to war and so I really had a lot ofmisgivings and I decided not to go and Istarted to get interested in communismat the end of high school partly becauseof that video and also I had a classcommunism fascism and democracy and mysenior year in high school and I foundmyself very leaning to the principles ofcommunism as I read them in theCommunist Manifesto etc then one thing Ididn't say is in that religious retreatthat I was on I got to know that retreatgroup and then we went to mass which isthe liturgy for it was a youth massevery Thursday evening I remember and Iwas really liking it a lot because Ifinally had some people my age who hadthe same intense mmm value of theirfaith but one I think the bad thingsthat happened was the priest that wasrunning that program there was a churchretreat program in Delaware hisprincipal's must have been Wiggy becauseone time when I was saying goodbye andthere was no one else around he slippedme the tongue and that was just like soout of pocket and it was very disturbingand I had I've always been a rebelliouskind of person and so I just didn't wantto lose my beautiful love of going tothe masson Thursday evening with these otheryoung Catholic people and so I didn'tstay away because I was like how dare hetry to take that away from me you knowis the one love that I found that wasreally upholding me and my faith and mysense of self and so to have that takenby him doing that I'm not going to givehim that satisfaction he's gonna have toface it and I thought he would apologizeand he didn't but anyway that's anotherstory for another time I went to collegeand there I became really radicalizedand that's what happens to a lot ofpeople they lose their principles theylose their faith because in college alot of the professors are very radicaland that was the case for where I wentto the University of Delaware you know Ihad some radical professors and I wasvery influenced by them and they had usread all kinds of material that was allfrom that perspective and that createdmy next chapter of life so I graduated[ __ ] laude from college with a degree inpolitical science and a minor insociology which included mostly womenstudies then I went to I worked as awaitress I moved to Washington DC Ibecame a lesbian and then I became arevolutionary communist and I moved toCalifornia Berkeley Oakland SanFrancisco area and for 24 years I was arevolutionary communist and out there onthe street I sometimes say 24/7 365because it felt like that I mean wereally only took I took like a four dayvacation to see my family to who was onthe East Coast maybe twice a year onaverage and that's all I saw in myfamily so you know you're in NASH or Iwas I was immersed in that revolutionarycommunist ideology I had tons of readingto do well it seemed like tons to me andwe would always be sharing theirnewspaper with the people and I lovepeople so I always loved going out andtalking with the people but honestlythat ideology had complete sway over mythinking for 24 adult years and itwasn't until 2006 when I leftum that I actually got I left thatorganisation's milieu and I started tokind of open up to healing I needed alot of healing I had really been verychronically ill for a long time and anumber of dimensions and when I cameback to my faith was 2009 and it wasafter some pretty hard things hadhappened in life and I'm really gladthat I did come back to my faith andit's been extremely hospitable it'sbetter than I ever loved it like what Ilove that as a kid it's it's more it'sricher it's a whole nother level ofdevelopment in my faith and I'm reallyhappy that I can relate with mygrandmother who passed I can relate withmy father who passed I can relate withmy family members again Sanko sometimeswith my family members we seemed liketwo ships that pass through the night asI was getting more conservative theywere getting more leftist and that'swhat I think has happened in society andI kind of feel like I was a bellwethergoing going ahead of the direction thatwas going towards the left and nowhopefully I'm ahead of the direction inthe walking away and I hope more andmore people do walk away I do encouragepeople to go back to the faith of theirroots if they have those roots and ifthey don't have those roots pleaseexplore please explore relevant radioexplore the patrick madrid show explorethe bible explore going to mass and ifyou have different roots deepen deepeninto your roots if they're solid youknow and if they uphold family becausepart of the tragedy of the ideology thati got involved with is they had completecontempt for the traditional familyvalues and the whole LGBTQ thing to meit's tragic what it did to my life whatit did to my family I find it to betragic and I would be happy to helpnurture anybody who is even if they evenhave a hint that they might want to getout of that lifeI'd be happy to help them you know andit doesn't matter to me that I'll getcriticized I already do I've never caredthat you know people will hate me if Isay if I speak my mind if I say what Ithink is true that's what I think weneed to do all of us say what we thinkis true and I I kind of expect to becriticized I've kind of lived my wholelife being criticized I mean you think Ididn't get criticized when I was arevolutionary communist for 24 years I'mso used to it but now I feel reallystrong and I feel happy and I'm reallyglad that we have a president that makessome sense I don't care that he has arough edge I really don't care myhusband has a rough edge and I love himto death so yeah there is life afterleftism so I encourage you all whohaven't walked away yet to take thatstep all right[Music]um this is my walkaway video and I justwant to tell you a little bit about mybackground and why I'm going public so Igrew up very Catholic and a Catholicfamily on the East Coast and I alwaysloved my Catholic faith even wanted tobe a priest when I was little I alwayscared about justice and would alwaysspeak up for justice in any scenario foranybody who seemed to be treatedunjustlyI became gender dysphoria at an earlyageand didn't affect my life in atremendous way but it was challengingand I went on to enjoy public school fora while and I say enjoy but really I gota lot bullied and I went to a CatholicHigh School after that and where I founda lot of good treatment and it felt likehome and people considered you as ahuman being as a holistic human beingrather than just an object that they hadto teach which is what I had found inthe public schools in that area where Iwas which was in Delaware I applied toWest Point and was nominated to WestPoint by Joe Biden actually and this wasan odd blip on an otherwise very radicalleftist what would you say radar andwhen I was in high school after I hadapplied and while I was gettingnominated I actually went to a religiousretreat and it moved me a lot one of thethings they showed was a filmstrip ofthe children in Vietnam being bombedwith napalm and the kids you knowrunning you know with their naked bodiesor with having had napalm on their skinand it it really made me veryit repelled me it repulsed me the ideaof joining the US military after I'dseen that and also Reagan got elected atthat time and everybody was telling itall you know Tracy it's so great you'regonna go to West Point so I gotnominated to the West Point by Joe Bidenbut I had a lot of misgivings when I sawa religious retreat video that showedwhat was being done to the children inVietnam or what had been done and sowhen I was having those misgivings thenRonald Reagan was elected and peoplewere saying oh Tracy this is reallygreat that you're gonna be going to WestPoint because they're gonna get a lot ofmoney and I was never really into moneyand I was really troubled I was likethis is not great this means we're gonnago to war and so I really had a lot ofmisgivings and I decided not to go and Istarted to get interested in communismat the end of high school partly becauseof that video and also I had a classcommunism fascism and democracy and mysenior year in high school and I foundmyself very leaning to the principles ofcommunism as I read them in theCommunist Manifesto etc then one thing Ididn't say is in that religious retreatthat I was on I got to know that retreatgroup and then we went to mass which isthe liturgy for it was a youth massevery Thursday evening I remember and Iwas really liking it a lot because Ifinally had some people my age who hadthe same intense mmm value of theirfaith but one I think the bad thingsthat happened was the priest that wasrunning that program there was a churchretreat program in Delaware hisprincipal's must have been Wiggy becauseone time when I was saying goodbye andthere was no one else around he slippedme the tongue and that was just like soout of pocket and it was very disturbingand I had I've always been a rebelliouskind of person and so I just didn't wantto lose my beautiful love of going tothe masson Thursday evening with these otheryoung Catholic people and so I didn'tstay away because I was like how dare hetry to take that away from me you knowis the one love that I found that wasreally upholding me and my faith and mysense of self and so to have that takenby him doing that I'm not going to givehim that satisfaction he's gonna have toface it and I thought he would apologizeand he didn't but anyway that's anotherstory for another time I went to collegeand there I became really radicalizedand that's what happens to a lot ofpeople they lose their principles theylose their faith because in college alot of the professors are very radicaland that was the case for where I wentto the University of Delaware you know Ihad some radical professors and I wasvery influenced by them and they had usread all kinds of material that was allfrom that perspective and that createdmy next chapter of life so I graduated[ __ ] laude from college with a degree inpolitical science and a minor insociology which included mostly womenstudies then I went to I worked as awaitress I moved to Washington DC Ibecame a lesbian and then I became arevolutionary communist and I moved toCalifornia Berkeley Oakland SanFrancisco area and for 24 years I was arevolutionary communist and out there onthe street I sometimes say 24/7 365because it felt like that I mean wereally only took I took like a four dayvacation to see my family to who was onthe East Coast maybe twice a year onaverage and that's all I saw in myfamily so you know you're in NASH or Iwas I was immersed in that revolutionarycommunist ideology I had tons of readingto do well it seemed like tons to me andwe would always be sharing theirnewspaper with the people and I lovepeople so I always loved going out andtalking with the people but honestlythat ideology had complete sway over mythinking for 24 adult years and itwasn't until 2006 when I leftum that I actually got I left thatorganisation's milieu and I started tokind of open up to healing I needed alot of healing I had really been verychronically ill for a long time and anumber of dimensions and when I cameback to my faith was 2009 and it wasafter some pretty hard things hadhappened in life and I'm really gladthat I did come back to my faith andit's been extremely hospitable it'sbetter than I ever loved it like what Ilove that as a kid it's it's more it'sricher it's a whole nother level ofdevelopment in my faith and I'm reallyhappy that I can relate with mygrandmother who passed I can relate withmy father who passed I can relate withmy family members again Sanko sometimeswith my family members we seemed liketwo ships that pass through the night asI was getting more conservative theywere getting more leftist and that'swhat I think has happened in society andI kind of feel like I was a bellwethergoing going ahead of the direction thatwas going towards the left and nowhopefully I'm ahead of the direction inthe walking away and I hope more andmore people do walk away I do encouragepeople to go back to the faith of theirroots if they have those roots and ifthey don't have those roots pleaseexplore please explore relevant radioexplore the patrick madrid show explorethe bible explore going to mass and ifyou have different roots deepen deepeninto your roots if they're solid youknow and if they uphold family becausepart of the tragedy of the ideology thati got involved with is they had completecontempt for the traditional familyvalues and the whole LGBTQ thing to meit's tragic what it did to my life whatit did to my family I find it to betragic and I would be happy to helpnurture anybody who is even if they evenhave a hint that they might want to getout of that lifeI'd be happy to help them you know andit doesn't matter to me that I'll getcriticized I already do I've never caredthat you know people will hate me if Isay if I speak my mind if I say what Ithink is true that's what I think weneed to do all of us say what we thinkis true and I I kind of expect to

I was scared didn't know what was gonnahappen and it all started with a reallyinnocent question that my husband askedme he just turned to me one day and hesaid what if what if eternal Trump winsand I was like and because by that timethat wasn't gonna happen so in 2016 Iwas had been laid off from my job Istarted driving for uber and lyft and Iwas driving mostly in downtown San Diegoand I meant just about every kind ofperson could possibly think of in 95percent of which were liberals and ofcourse being an election year and beingthe driver everybody wanted to track funTrump and I made the mistake ofmentioning once that I thought you mightnot be too bad I was called namesI screamed that I was actually reportedto her for discrimination they lubbersreally big up here but they have a starsystem they had they gave me one starand then they had all of their friendswho I had never even driven for goingwrite bad news for me and that was justbecause Isaid I didn't think he might not youmight not be so bad it might not be theend of the world and so that was thatwas the beginning of it and I'm kind ofashamed to say that I was I was bad Iwas cowed I let that he elements me I Inever said anything or no I didn't sayanything as long as I was driving foruber again and I thought I was justbeing a really crappy Democrat I'mpro-life and I thought I I just didn'thave a voice and so I was completely redpill and I know exactly what day it wasit was May 27 2016I was working downtown and I got arequest from San Diego Convention CenterI lined up in the uber cute with uberslips taxis and it wasn't even untilpeople started coming out of theConvention Center that I realized thatit was a trump rally so I'm sorry mr.Konishiso as I've located my customers I had areally really loud commotion behind meand a very large group of people cameacross the street from the conventioncenter from Gaslamp Quarter which isbasically where like all of the bars andand stuff are and they surrounded usthey were screaming at us they wereyelling at us spitting at us I got mycustomers into the car and then I gotgrabbed pulled pushed trying to keep youfrom getting into my vehicleand I'm just trying to explain them tothem then I'm like come on got to likeI'm just trying to do my job I'm justtrying to feed my kids and you pleasejust let us leave I got called a traitora racist when I got in the car I juststopped very stunned and the protestorswere banging them in windows andpounding on my carand it took until the police came righthere to drive them away from the cube sothat me and the other drivers couldleave and 35 people were arrested thatbad and my poor customers basement therisks of apologizing to protestersbecause I didn't change I haven'tchanged I didn't turn my back on manthey turn their back on me so when I sawbond instructor IDEO for the first timeI was so relieved it gave me hopeI found that I wasn't alone that mycompletion fear was felt by other peoplejoin walk away and I'm watching thetestimonials dispelled that confusionfor me and that beard it's given mestrength to stand up for what I believein and I'll no longer be silent and I'llbe voting for[Applause][Music]

I was a Democrat from the Tomica vote Ivoted for Clinton the second term I wasold and old enough and I felt that as acountry why were we so concerned aboutwho he supposedly had an affair with andthat it was none of our business and andso on and so forth and I thought myselfvery progressive in that you know beinga music major I had gay friends I hadblack friends I have friends from othercountries different religions and Ibecame a Christian and I started to prayabout who I should vote for and I didn'tvote for a president Bush either timeand then President Obama came along andI prayed and I didn't feel like heshould be President there was somethingthat I felt like he had a young familyhe was still very young I felt that hewouldn't take our country in a gooddirection and I didn't feel that that'swhere God was leading me to vote so Ididn't vote for him and then the time heran again I didn't vote for him againbecause his moratorium on the Gulfdeeply affected my family and a lot ofmy friends families as I live insouthern Louisiana now that being saidbecause I didn't vote for him all of asudden I became a racist a bigot ahomophobe as I learned more about thehorrors of Islamic extremists and triedto voice my concerns about that I becamean Islamophobe apparently as wellI was also damaging my womanhood somehowI don't know exactly what that wassupposed to meannow as a mother of four and a ChristianI can no longer stay silent and I can nolonger sit idly by holding on to myDemocrat card just in case they provideme with a candidate that might be goodenough to represent my family and thelast straw was when Hillary Clintondidn't win and yes I voted Trump whenshe didn't win and people had completemeltdowns it'd be got even worsepeople who have known me for decadeswe're like oh you just voted for himbecause you know your husband's in theoil field or you just voted for himbecause you're really a racist and I'mlike I've never been racist in my lifeyou you just don't want gay people tohave the same rights as you and sayanything about gay people I don't have aproblem with gay people I don'tunderstand and I watch greater andgreater the divide and I watched moreand more this behavior coming up and thethe generation behind me really justthem melting down and throwing tempertantrums like my little kids and I'mlike I would not accept this from mychildren and this is what you have toknow about me I am an epileptic I'vesuffered with seizures for over 15 yearsnow and yes I believe that God will healme in that timeframe I've had fourbeautiful children also a battled breastcancer and thank you Jesus I survivednow there's a reason I'm saying that Ididn't survive all of that and havethese four beautiful children to watchthem grow up in a country that I don'teven recognize anymore and it's sad whenI see people and the Democratic Partythrowing out socialism as an option forgovernment socialism has failed in everycountry it has ever been in and it willnot work in the United States thinkingthat you can give everything away forfree is not gonna work because somebodyhas to pay for it eventually and at thatmoment when I saw more and more peoplescreaming and wearing pink hats andscreaming out their personal partsbecause of Donald Trump or whatever itwas that was going on as I saw more andmore of this coming along and just theway women started acting in the damaskutilization of men and just the justit was heartbreaking it was like thedestruction of families all types offamilies I couldn't take it anymoreand last week I officially switched fromthe Democratic Party to becoming aregistered Republican because this 40year old wouldn't tolerate that crapfrom her little children and she doesn'twant her children to think that theyshould grow up to tolerate that behavioreither I would not allow my children tocarry on like this and still be throwinga temper tantrum two years after thefact and I refuse to sit by and watchothers do the same I will no longerenable them in their confusion sadnesswhatever it is that they have and I lovethem it doesn't change the fact that Ilove my friends that voted for Hillarybut I'm sorry I voted for Trump I'm notsorry about that I'm sorryyour candidate loss for you and that youcan't seem to handle that I thought youwere taught how to be a good sport butas of now I have officially walked awayfrom the Democratic Party and I have nointentions of going back and I don'tfeel bad about it and everyone have ablessed night
hello everybody my name is um ShawnAllen and I live in Michigan actually alittle city called Pontiac Michigan I'man ordinary men astir stage actor I do alot of different things blue collarworker for a corporation here in thecity of Pontiac and while I'm sitting onthe side of the corner maximallyenjoying the milkshake right now okay umI decided that I would take the time outto do my walk away video all right I seethat the walk away movement has takenoff and spawn into a great movement andI guess to give my reasons for why Idecided to walk away um short side ofthe story is is that you could say thatmy process of walking away was somethingthat was kind of over time probablygoing back to when I was a soldier okayI served as a military policeman in theUnited States Army back in the 90sfrom 91 to 98 to be exact was stationedat Schofield Barracks and that wasactually during the Clinton regime okayum it was during that regime that Ireally began to be a little focused onpolitics so to speak you know my familywas always Democrats lifelong Democratsyou know always just blue for just forthe sake of being blue quote-unquote umso all I knew was Democrats but I guessyou could say that from my militaryexperience my military experience openedmy eyes to a lot of things on politicalas far as on a good side it actuallyopened my eyes to how a greater countryAmerica really is okay um I always tellmy friends you really don't know howblessed you are to live in America tillyou get outside the continental UnitedStates and having visited or made pitstops in other countries along the wayduring my tenure in the militaryactually showed me how blessed that wereally are for the United States ofAmerica do we have our issues yes but atthe same time I have to admit that thisis the greatest country on the planetI wouldn't want to be anywhere else andI'm saying that acid African Americanbut anyway to stay on course with thestory cuz I don't want to take up toomuch of you guys time um it was duringthat regime that I just kind of startedpaying attention to a lot of things Iwasn't a fan of Hillary you know she wasjust the first lady I have my reasons Iwon't go into all of that right nowmaybe if I post another video I will umand then I just started paying attentionthings it's like Clinton was called thisso-called first black president but astrying to go on come to find out thatthe so-called black first blackpresident quote-unquote actually wasresponsible for a lot of laws and for alot of legislation that actually got themost number of blacks incarcerated okayduring that time frameokay so I'll talk about real black onblack crime okay and so anyway um overthe years especially as I startedmaturing in my faith because as Imentioned at the beginning of my video Iam an ordained elder within the churchgot sanctified and as time started goingon as the Lord started to kind ofbroaden my thinking along the lines ofnot so much emotional thinking but moreor less just clear-cut objectivethinking okay um you start seeing thingsthat make you raise the eyebrow um youknow you start seeing the more emotionaldisplays and then when I startedlearning the history of the party here'sa party that out of all the obstaclesthat black people have faced since we'vebeen in this country the Ku Klux KlanMargaret Sanger I can go on and on Iknow on Jim Crow segregation laws all ofthese things were basically initiated byDemocratic congresses and policies ifyou will that has to this day decimatedthe black community at the end of theday and what's frightening is that isdone in such a way that has created asense of dissonance amongst our peoplethat I find very alarming to me isalmost like a brand of socialengineering at his best I don't want tosound like too much like a conspiracytheorist so as times just went onespecially now in the current regimeright now you just are seeing so manythings that the far left has done tocorrupt the minds of our people theminds of academiayou just see so much and so thus I hadto really do a major shift in mythinking a complete paradigm shift in mythinking about this party as a whole nowI'm not one to say that I'm gonnaautomatically just vote Republican butwhat I will say is is that I am nowquote-unquote a free thinker when itcomes to politics and have to admit thatthere's still a lot more growth than Ineed in understanding politics andthings like that so I'm gonna kind ofchampion a cause if you will to educatemyself and anybody that's willing tolisten on how we need to be more in tunewith what goes on within the politicalsystems but as a whole and I'm hopingthat this is making sense because thisis kind of new to me I can preach infront of people I can perform in frontof people on the stage but making thevideo is it's kind of like I'm actuallykind of bashful but that's besides thepoint anyway um my that is like the thefruit of my walk away story and the moreI dig into it the more I see things onCNN and some of the things I've seenwhen I watch videos on YouTube andthings of that nature I see that thissocialistic left-wing SJW thinking hasreally created just this crazy sense ofdissonance amongst the people that thatit's it's it's borderline scary to behonest with you so thus that is some ofthe reasons as to why I chose to walkaway okaywhere it leads me um we will ultimatelysee but what I will say is this is thatunder President Trump now I'll be honestI didn't vote for him okay I didn't votefor it I'm not necessarily a trumpslappy if I can say that what are beingoffensive to anybody but if we want tolook at objectively that yes blackunemployment is at an all-time highokay a historical high uh jobs arecoming back okay um we just see so muchokay so much and instead of just writingthis emotional rollercoasteroh he's erases or Ohthis and that oh he's using the the Naziplaybook I've heard I've heard it allokay and at the end of the day therejust seems to be nothing to substantiatethe claims of any type of racism or anytype of conspiracy theories that he'sgonna decimate the black race and sendus back to Africa I had an argument withsomebody about this the wholeimmigration thing is all about justtrying to get black people out of herebla bla bla bla bla I ain't goingnowhere okay I was born and raised hereokay I got the paperwork to validatethat I was born and raised here I'm notgoing anywhereso y'all could keep that you could kickrocks with that with that philosophyright there umand so yes so I see that he's trying andeven if I'm not if I didn't vote for theguy one thing that I believe in is thisI don't want him to fail as presidentokay because if he fails then in myopinion America fails okay and I saidthat about any president okay be aRepublican Democrat independent I reallydon't care because at the time that theyare in office they are the the the theface of this country and so thus if theyif he feels we feel okay and I don'tcare dude Gentile black or white youdon't matter okay you really don'tmatter so the minister in me thepreacher in me says that because thereis proportion of Scripture that lets usknow that we should pray for our leadersour elected officials we keep them inprayer okay and if the Saints of the NewTestament we're able to pray for rulerslike Nero if you know anything abouthistory then surely we could pray forPresident Trump even if you disagreewith his rhetoric his tweets and thingsof that nature you can still lift him upin prayer okay he deserves prayer thatmuch okay he deserves that much from thepeople too um again I just think thatthis emotional roller-coaster wave thatyou see from the left wing of thevictimization the sale of thevictimizing and things of that natureit's ridiculous okay and then the theliberal elite okay that basically in myopinion just used black people just toexploit us anyway okay and that's myconspiracy theory about thatthe illegal immigrants and stuff likethat I won't go into that right nowmaybe in another video some other timemaybe I will but basically in a nutshellthen to not take up any more you guystime I wanted this to be just a minorintroduction to myself as to why I choseto walk away from the Democratic Partyor as I've heard it called in which Iaffectionately believe that it is I'vegotten off the Democratic plantationokay and it will take an act of God okayto send a candidate that that that istruthful about the history of this partybefore I would even consider flipping aswitch for that for that party everagainor at least they have so much they wouldhave to apologize before before beforethey even get my attention at the end ofthe day I don't even give us anotherblack person running okay at the end ofthe day I don't care okay they couldtell me that Barack is coming back okayI really don't care okay so at the endof the day I just wanted to give my walkaway story all right my name is SeanAllen and once again coming from thegood old city of Pontiac Michigan thisis why I chose to walk away maybe I postanother video sometime soon god blessyou guys god bless america love you alland they keep walking keep walking seeyou guys soon byeyouhello everybody my name is um ShawnAllen and I live in Michigan actually alittle city called Pontiac Michigan I'man ordinary men astir stage actor I do alot of different things blue collarworker for a corporation here in thecity of Pontiac and while I'm sitting onthe side of the corner maximallyenjoying the milkshake right now okay umI decided that I would take the time outto do my walk away video all right I seethat the walk away movement has takenoff and spawn into a great movement andI guess to give my reasons for why Idecided to walk away um short side ofthe story is is that you could say thatmy process of walking away was somethingthat was kind of over time probablygoing back to when I was a soldier okayI served as a military policeman in theUnited States Army back in the 90sfrom 91 to 98 to be exact was stationedat Schofield Barracks and that wasactually during the Clinton regime okayum it was during that regime that Ireally began to be a little focused onpolitics so to speak you know my familywas always Democrats lifelong Democratsyou know always just blue for just forthe sake of being blue quote-unquote umso all I knew was Democrats but I guessyou could say that from my militaryexperience my military experience openedmy eyes to a lot of things on politicalas far as on a good side it actuallyopened my eyes to how a greater countryAmerica really is okay um I always tellmy friends you really don't know howblessed you are to live in America tillyou get outside the continental UnitedStates and having visited or made pitstops in other countries along the wayduring my tenure in the militaryactually showed me how blessed that wereally are for the United States ofAmerica do we have our issues yes but atthe same time I have to admit that thisis the greatest country on the planetI wouldn't want to be anywhere else andI'm saying that acid African Americanbut anyway to stay on course with thestory cuz I don't want to take up toomuch of you guys time um it was duringthat regime that I just kind of startedpaying attention to a lot of things Iwasn't a fan of Hillary you know she wasjust the first lady I have my reasons Iwon't go into all of that right nowmaybe if I post another video I will umand then I just started paying attentionthings it's like Clinton was called thisso-called first black president but astrying to go on come to find out thatthe so-called black first blackpresident quote-unquote actually wasresponsible for a lot of laws and for alot of legislation that actually got themost number of blacks incarcerated okayduring that time frameokay so I'll talk about real black onblack crime okay and so anyway um overthe years especially as I startedmaturing in my faith because as Imentioned at the beginning of my video Iam an ordained elder within the churchgot sanctified and as time started goingon as the Lord started to kind ofbroaden my thinking along the lines ofnot so much emotional thinking but moreor less just clear-cut objectivethinking okay um you start seeing thingsthat make you raise the eyebrow um youknow you start seeing the more emotionaldisplays and then when I startedlearning the history of the party here'sa party that out of all the obstaclesthat black people have faced since we'vebeen in this country the Ku Klux KlanMargaret Sanger I can go on and on Iknow on Jim Crow segregation laws all ofthese things were basically initiated byDemocratic congresses and policies ifyou will that has to this day decimatedthe black community at the end of theday and what's frightening is that isdone in such a way that has created asense of dissonance amongst our peoplethat I find very alarming to me isalmost like a brand of socialengineering at his best I don't want tosound like too much like a conspiracytheorist so as times just went onespecially now in the current regimeright now you just are seeing so manythings that the far left has done tocorrupt the minds of our people theminds of academiayou just see so much and so thus I hadto really do a major shift in mythinking a complete paradigm shift in mythinking about this party as a whole nowI'm not one to say that I'm gonnaautomatically just vote Republican butwhat I will say is is that I am nowquote-unquote a free thinker when itcomes to politics and have to admit thatthere's still a lot more growth than Ineed in understanding politics andthings like that so I'm gonna kind ofchampion a cause if you will to educatemyself and anybody that's willing tolisten on how we need to be more in tunewith what goes on within the politicalsystems but as a whole and I'm hopingthat this is making sense because thisis kind of new to me I can preach infront of people I can perform in frontof people on the stage but making thevideo is it's kind of like I'm actuallykind of bashful but that's besides thepoint anyway um my that is like the thefruit of my walk away story and the moreI dig into it the more I see things onCNN and some of the things I've seenwhen I watch videos on YouTube andthings of that nature I see that thissocialistic left-wing SJW thinking hasreally created just this crazy sense ofdissonance amongst the people that thatit's it's it's borderline scary to behonest with you so thus that is some ofthe reasons as to why I chose to walkaway okaywhere it leads me um we will ultimatelysee but what I will say is this is thatunder President Trump now I'll be honestI didn't vote for him okay I didn't votefor it I'm not necessarily a trumpslappy if I can say that what are beingoffensive to anybody but if we want tolook at objectively that yes blackunemployment is at an all-time highokay a historical high uh jobs arecoming back okay um we just see so muchokay so much and instead of just writingthis emotional rollercoasteroh he's erases or Ohthis and that oh he's using the the Naziplaybook I've heard I've heard it allokay and at the end of the day therejust seems to be nothing to substantiatethe claims of any type of racism or anytype of conspiracy theories that he'sgonna decimate the black race and sendus back to Africa I had an argument withsomebody about this the wholeimmigration thing is all about justtrying to get black people out of herebla bla bla bla bla I ain't goingnowhere okay I was born and raised hereokay I got the paperwork to validatethat I was born and raised here I'm notgoing anywhereso y'all could keep that you could kickrocks with that with that philosophyright there umand so yes so I see that he's trying andeven if I'm not if I didn't vote for theguy one thing that I believe in is thisI don't want him to fail as presidentokay because if he fails then in myopinion America fails okay and I saidthat about any president okay be aRepublican Democrat independent I reallydon't care because at the time that theyare in office they are the the the theface of this country and so thus if theyif he feels we feel okay and I don'tcare dude Gentile black or white youdon't matter okay you really don'tmatter so the minister in me thepreacher in me says that because thereis proportion of Scripture that lets usknow that we should pray for our leadersour elected officials we keep them inprayer okay and if the Saints of the NewTestament we're able to pray for rulerslike Nero if you know anything abouthistory then surely we could pray forPresident Trump even if you disagreewith his rhetoric his tweets and thingsof that nature you can still lift him upin prayer okay he deserves prayer thatmuch okay he deserves that much from thepeople too um again I just think thatthis emotional roller-coaster wave thatyou see from the left wing of thevictimization the sale of thevictimizing and things of that natureit's ridiculous okay and then the theliberal elite okay that basically in myopinion just used black people just toexploit us anyway okay and that's myconspiracy theory about thatthe illegal immigrants and stuff likethat I won't go into that right nowmaybe in another video some other timemaybe I will but basically in a nutshellthen to not take up any more you guystime I wanted this to be just a minorintroduction to myself as to why I choseto walk away from the Democratic Partyor as I've heard it called in which Iaffectionately believe that it is I'vegotten off the Democratic plantationokay and it will take an act of God okayto send a candidate that that that istruthful about the history of this partybefore I would even consider flipping aswitch for that for that party everagainor at least they have so much they wouldhave to apologize before before beforethey even get my attention at the end ofthe day I don't even give us anotherblack person running okay at the end ofthe day I don't care okay they couldtell me that Barack is coming back okayI really don't care okay so at the endof the day I just wanted to give my walkaway story all right my name is SeanAllen and once again coming from thegood old city of Pontiac Michigan thisis why I chose to walk away maybe I postanother video sometime soon god blessyou guys god bless america love you alland they keep walking keep walking seeyou guys soon byeyou

hello facebookfamily hello facebook family youtubefamilyand wherever this video will take us uhi'm jeff this is my wife tammy for therobinsonswe're gonna talk about the hashtag walkawaywalk away my wife uh she introduced thiscampaign to me i hadn't heard anythingabout it i spent a fair amount of timeon social mediaand uh i saw a few things but justdidn't pay attention to itand then one day she told me she waswatching some videosand found this this excellent walkawaycampaignso we want to tell our story justaverage americans out theretelling their story about theirdeparturefrom the democratic party and i'll lether go first and then i'll come backwith youwell let's see starting when i was 18years oldi was so excited about voting i was asenior in high schooland so it was the it was a voting yearand i caught the bus home ran into thehouse and asked my parentshow do we vote because i knew it was arepublican democrat so i said how do wevoteand my mom says we vote democrats so igot back in the car and went tothe place the voting booth and i justvoted straight democratum and i believe it was jesse jacksonthat was running for president that yearumso that's basically the extent of mebeing a democratvery short uh time for that becausebased on my christian uh beliefscauses me to be conservative becausewhat the bible saysand what i believe in this helps me andpropels mein how i vote so you can kind of say uhinever was maybe it was a small walk awayi guess it was but um we've always beenconservative because of ourbiblical beliefs and i'm kind of excitedabout this walk away campaign that istumbled uponbecause we do want truth to prevail wewant truth onall levels political truth biblicaltruthall truth and so we are excited about itand uh we're going to tell more peopleabout it and i think myself my husbandsaid well let'slet's do our own so that is my walk awayor never wasand uh based on my conservative beliefsbecause i believethat it lines up more uh with mychristian beliefs as well so that's howi feel about it andtake it away husband it just i thinkit's important there's something that wewere saying because we'rechristians we're christians first orchristianitycomes before our our identity ourblackness if you will sureand in america you know they're just socolor struck it's either white it'seither black or brown and all of thesethingsuh but but our christianity our beliefin faith in jesus christ is eternalour blackness is temporary uh this iswho we are we're not ashamed of ourblackness we're not embarrassed aboutour blackness not at alluh you know it comes down to melanin itreally is a silly argument this wholeracial thingit comes down to melanin uh all melaninis when you put it under a microscopescope is brown uh it's tanand so some people have more melanin andother people haveless and if you have no melanin you'realbinothis is a scientific proof then thebible certainly tells usthat out of one blood in acts chapter 17paul was talking to the smart folks inathensthe philosophers and he told them thatout of one blood out of one mangod made all nations to dwell upon theface of the earthso this whole racial argument back andforth is ridiculousbut when i heard about the the hashtagwalk awayand she she mentioned it she said welllet's tell our story and i said welli tell my story i said if i would changethe name of the campaignit would be the hashtag never wasbecause i never was a democratobviously many of the members of myfamily are democratsbut even as a young man i grew up and ijust knew uh when jimmy carter ran forpresidenti said something about that guy justdon't and of course i'm going from atotally uninformed positionsure yes i was going by my gut a lot ofpeople do that nowadays you knowand even as a young man i thought yeah ijust said something about that jimmycarter that i don't likei used to watch him on tv and hear someof the things he said and his policiesi didn't agree with him and when ronaldreaganuh ran for president i just thought thatthere's somethingi like what he's saying i like what i'mhearing it'smatching my beliefs my core valuesright we were listening to anotherhashtag walk away videoand an individual was talking about hiscore valuesit's not about the democratic party orthe republican partyit's about core values absolutely and ifyou have core valueswhichever party is closer closer alignedto thosevalues that's natural you're going to gowith soas a young man i didn't pay too muchattention to politics you know in highschoolonce when i graduated when i was 18 in1979that's a long time ago yes anywayi wasn't too much paying attention topolitics but uhi voted for reagan in his second termandby 1984 i i was more aware of politicsstarted paying attention and ronaldreagan was the first presidentthat i voted for i registered as arepublican and i've been a registeredrepublican ever sinceso i've never been a democrat because inever agreed with their viewswhat shapes my viewsare again the bible biblical viewsour views biblical views but then alsouh they did a strange thing to me when iwas in elementary school they taught mehow to readit's a dangerous it's a dangerous thingto teach someone how to readand so i uh uh when i was younger ididn't necessarily like reading iskipped all my book reports in schooland didn't want to do itand as i grow older i regretted thatbecause you can learna lot by just reading so i began to doresearch i began to study i'm just thatkind of individual i do that with thebible i read the biblei read the books of the theologians iread historyyou know a science and so i read and ijust started to do my own researchon the republican and the democraticparty exactlyafter a while and i i've read theirplatforms you know allall political parties have platforms youhave the communist party usathey have a platform but unfortunately95 percent of their platform matches thedemocratic platformuh so i read the democratic platform iread the republican platform i read theconstitution party platformi read history i read the constitutionand all of those things and i and i andi come to find that i havemore in common with the republican partyconservatism uh uhuh capitalism uh hatred patriotismwe love this we love our country familyyesuh this is the greatest nation on theface of the earth yeswe all have our problems as christianswe believe the bible teaches that all ofus are sinnersyes the bible teaches that there is nonegood no not oneso all of us are flawed all of us haveproblems and this country is made up ofindividuals and individuals haveproblems yesbut this country is the greatest countryon the face of the earth with hisconstitutions we'rewe're a nation of laws we're not anation ofthe founders didn't give us a democracythat guaranteed us a republicso we're a nation of laws uh the theconstitutionis not a racist document yeahand so i started to study and researchi i i looked at the democratic thedemocratic party and their foundingsunder andrew jackson in the 1820sand then i looked at the republicanparty and his foundings founded byfreed slave and also uh whiteabolitionistswho were against slavery uh thedemocratic party was in favor of slaveryslavery and and while i'm on thatslavery pointamerica didn't invent slavery slaveryhas been aroundsince the fall but then also in inamericaslavery was imposed upon americaby britain because remember this thisnation started as colonistsand and slavery was imposed upon thisnationand so then when the founders set aboutto to gain their freedoms from britainthen they started to look and say wellhow can we uh cry for our freedomwhen there are uh millions of blackcitizensor black individuals at that time theyweren't citizensuh black individuals who are in slaverywho want their freedom how canthe founders say how can we uh demandour rights and freedomswhen we have people in slavery so theyset about to establish thatand abolish it and certainly by 1854when the republican party was foundedit was founded to end slaveryi mean to do away with it and that was arepublicanuh then of course when they startedpassing legislationthe 13th amendment passed by republicansoneuh republicans in congress in the senatethe 14th amendmentthat basically ended slavery and gaveslaves therights of citizenship passed byrepublicans opposed by democrats15th amendment passed i believe in 1870passed by republicans opposed bydemocratsthen all throughout reconstruction from1867 to 1877legislation passed by republicans aboutfreedblacks freed slaves became politiciansand doctors and lawyersand and landowners and business ownersand free thinkersand educators uh and then of courseafter 1877uh and i forget the uh the greatcompromise i think that's what it wasand it was another close presidentialrace you know like thatthe ones we've had under bush gore uhyou know clinton uh um uhwhat's his name trump so yeah and sothere was a compromise and unfortunatelythings turned aroundand all of the jim crow laws from the1890sall of the jim crow laws were passed bysouthern democrats you know what drivesme crazy is whenwhen you have these talking heads on tvmsnbccnn who are always blaming racism onamericano you need to lay the blame where itwas it wasit was democrats white southerndemocratsand many also northern uh democratswho are in favor of slavery and also thejim crow laws all of them are passed bydemocrats just just put the blamewhere it is and it's it's notall of america it's not all whiteright certain groups of whites andusually the democratic partyand then of course they say well they'llmake they'll agree and they'll say wellyeahall of those republicans all of thosedemocrats there was a great switch theytalked about thatthe big switch where all thoseall of those racist democrats becamerepublicansand again silly notions other people onthe walk away or thehashtag walk away campaign havediscussed that and it never happenedthere is no southern strategy big switchand all that stuffum so i just did my just did my researchand and i advise you to do yours yes uhi needtime to do research i never was ademocratand you don't even have to go back tothe 1960s and70s before that in the jim crows youknow during fromfrom 1890 all the way up to 1964 civilrights act in 1965 voting rights actyou don't have to go that far you canlook and see what the democrats aredoing todayexactly the democrats with their withtheir antifawho oppose and come against blacks uhcandace owenswas just assaulted candace owens and herassociate i think charles i forgetcharles last name they were attackedin philadelphia and um and many otherareas were thethe antifa and democrats democratsin the past the democrats they had waron the blacks during slavery and jimcrownow democrats have have war againstchristiansthey don't want christians to to um havetheirchristian beliefs and views they have awar againstthe womb children in the womb withabortionthey have a war against first amendmentrights because it seems like thedemocratic party feel likethey're the only ones who have a rightto speak but if you're black andconservative or if you're gay andconservative if you're anotherso-called minority group andconservative you don't have a right tospeakbut the democrats can voice their viewsand opinionsso the democratic party has been uhwe believe and i and i think during myresearchhas been a problem in america sincetheir foundingsand um i'm glad my wife and i are gladuh it's a prayer answer that more andmore people are waking upand turning away from the democraticparty you don't have to become arepublican again there's independentsout there there's a constitution partyas a matter of fact i didn't we didn'tvote for trump for donald trumpuh because initially i didn't think hewas conservative enoughhe i mean he was a democrat right hisown children couldn't vote for him inthe primary because they were stillregistered democratsso i thought he's not conservative i wasi was thinkingthey were bringing him in to destroy theconservative movementbut i like what trump is doing now andyou know what in 2020we'll vote for him so yeah yes we saiditand we'll vote for him and i'll admit ididn't vote for him in the beginning ivoted the constitution partyuh daryl castle so someone would say youprobably didn't even know what his namewas yes his name wascastle constitution party because i readtheir platform and iand their platform i agree with theirplatform more than a republican platformbut i'm a registered republican and aconservative a conservative personchristian firstand i'm a conservative because of my myresearch and studyand um that's our storyit's our story anything else you want toadd noi think this is good and hopefullythere'll be more videos coming from therobinson frontand we do have much more things we wantto share um and we're just hoping thatwe can dialogue and havea discussion without hate we can have adiscussionwithout oh i'm gonna unfriend you onfacebook or i'm not going to worshipwith you at church and get out of thechoiryou know and it's just really sad thathere's my thingi i'm very upset about how christiansare jumping on the secular bandwagon andare and are being hateful toward trumpor hateful toward conservative we aschristians should not hate at allexactlyat all we may not agree with somethingsomeone's doing or what is being saidbut we really should not hate and i seea lot of that on facebookso as christians we have a higher callwe can see from both ends of the tableor both endsand so we should apply our biblicalbeliefs to what is going onin our world today so i'm hoping hopinghoping that we canbe on one accord on some of these thingsand show forth the love of godin our hearts and toward the world verygoodand uh we will certainly have more tosayas time goes on this won't be the lastvideo because i believe thethe black conservative voice needs toget outyes al sharpton doesn't speak for me notat alljesse jackson uh a doctorwhat's his name mark whatever his nameheal whatever he comes onmichael dyson and none of those peoplemaxine watersuh certainly louis farrakhanthey do not speak for us they do notthey are not the black voicejay-z and beyonce are not the blackvoicewe're not monolithic we can speak forourselvesand we thank you for listening bye byei just wanted to make a short video wewanted to come backwhile it was fresh make a short video goon the recordwe never voted for barack obama becauseagain many people just assumewell you're black i bet you voted forbarack obamayou laid your uh conservative cardaside for a second because the the firstblackpresident of the united states you can'tpass up thisno didn't agree with his views hisvaluesuh didn't like his platform didn't likehis elitistuh attitude didn't like his own personalviewsand the mainstream media they justcelebrated him andtalked him up and um we didn't agreewith anything on his platformand so we did not vote in 2008 when heran against john mccain i think it wasjohn mccaini didn't vote for john mccain no wedidn't try to vote for john mccain orbarack obamaagain we voted constitution party and in2012when he ran against mitt romney mittromney was a nice enough fellow butagain i didn't think he was a strongenough conservativeso didn't vote for mitt romney votedconstitution party so again it'sunfortunately the lastpresidential three presidential cycleswe voted constitutional party so thatlets you know that we're not justcommitted to the republicanswe're considered we're committed toconservatismso i just wanted to go on recorddid not vote for barackobama either time either times[Music]youhello facebookfamily hello facebook family youtubefamilyand wherever this video will take us uhi'm jeff this is my wife tammy for therobinsonswe're gonna talk about the hashtag walkawaywalk away my wife uh she introduced thiscampaign to me i hadn't heard anythingabout it i spent a fair amount of timeon social mediaand uh i saw a few things but justdidn't pay attention to itand then one day she told me she waswatching some videosand found this this excellent walkawaycampaignso we want to tell our story justaverage americans out theretelling their story about theirdeparturefrom the democratic party and i'll lether go first and then i'll come backwith youwell let's see starting when i was 18years oldi was so excited about voting i was asenior in high schooland so it was the it was a voting yearand i caught the bus home ran into thehouse and asked my parentshow do we vote because i knew it was arepublican democrat so i said how do wevoteand my mom says we vote democrats so igot back in the car and went tothe place the voting booth and i justvoted straight democratum and i believe it was jesse jacksonthat was running for president that yearumso that's basically the extent of mebeing a democratvery short uh time for that becausebased on my christian uh beliefscauses me to be conservative becausewhat the bible saysand what i believe in this helps me andpropels mein how i vote so you can kind of say uhinever was maybe it was a small walk awayi guess it was but um we've always beenconservative because of ourbiblical beliefs and i'm kind of excitedabout this walk away campaign that istumbled uponbecause we do want truth to prevail wewant truth onall levels political truth biblicaltruthall truth and so we are excited about itand uh we're going to tell more peopleabout it and i think myself my husbandsaid well let'slet's do our own so that is my walk awayor never wasand uh based on my conservative beliefsbecause i believethat it lines up more uh with mychristian beliefs as well so that's howi feel about it andtake it away husband it just i thinkit's important there's something that wewere saying because we'rechristians we're christians first orchristianitycomes before our our identity ourblackness if you will sureand in america you know they're just socolor struck it's either white it'seither black or brown and all of thesethingsuh but but our christianity our beliefin faith in jesus christ is eternalour blackness is temporary uh this iswho we are we're not ashamed of ourblackness we're not embarrassed aboutour blackness not at alluh you know it comes down to melanin itreally is a silly argument this wholeracial thingit comes down to melanin uh all melaninis when you put it under a microscopescope is brown uh it's tanand so some people have more melanin andother people haveless and if you have no melanin you'realbinothis is a scientific proof then thebible certainly tells usthat out of one blood in acts chapter 17paul was talking to the smart folks inathensthe philosophers and he told them thatout of one blood out of one mangod made all nations to dwell upon theface of the earthso this whole racial argument back andforth is ridiculousbut when i heard about the the hashtagwalk awayand she she mentioned it she said welllet's tell our story and i said welli tell my story i said if i would changethe name of the campaignit would be the hashtag never wasbecause i never was a democratobviously many of the members of myfamily are democratsbut even as a young man i grew up and ijust knew uh when jimmy carter ran forpresidenti said something about that guy justdon't and of course i'm going from atotally uninformed positionsure yes i was going by my gut a lot ofpeople do that nowadays you knowand even as a young man i thought yeah ijust said something about that jimmycarter that i don't likei used to watch him on tv and hear someof the things he said and his policiesi didn't agree with him and when ronaldreaganuh ran for president i just thought thatthere's somethingi like what he's saying i like what i'mhearing it'smatching my beliefs my core valuesright we were listening to anotherhashtag walk away videoand an individual was talking about hiscore valuesit's not about the democratic party orthe republican partyit's about core values absolutely and ifyou have core valueswhichever party is closer closer alignedto thosevalues that's natural you're going to gowith soas a young man i didn't pay too muchattention to politics you know in highschoolonce when i graduated when i was 18 in1979that's a long time ago yes anywayi wasn't too much paying attention topolitics but uhi voted for reagan in his second termandby 1984 i i was more aware of politicsstarted paying attention and ronaldreagan was the first presidentthat i voted for i registered as arepublican and i've been a registeredrepublican ever sinceso i've never been a democrat because inever agreed with their viewswhat shapes my viewsare again the bible biblical viewsour views biblical views but then alsouh they did a strange thing to me when iwas in elementary school they taught mehow to readit's a dangerous it's a dangerous thingto teach someone how to readand so i uh uh when i was younger ididn't necessarily like reading iskipped all my book reports in schooland didn't want to do itand as i grow older i regretted thatbecause you can learna lot by just reading so i began to doresearch i began to study i'm just thatkind of individual i do that with thebible i read the biblei read the books of the theologians iread historyyou know a science and so i read and ijust started to do my own researchon the republican and the democraticparty exactlyafter a while and i i've read theirplatforms you know allall political parties have platforms youhave the communist party usathey have a platform but unfortunately95 percent of their platform matches thedemocratic platformuh so i read the democratic platform iread the republican platform i read theconstitution party platformi read history i read the constitutionand all of those things and i and i andi come to find that i havemore in common with the republican partyconservatism uh uhuh capitalism uh hatred patriotismwe love this we love our country familyyesuh this is the greatest nation on theface of the earth yeswe all have our problems as christianswe believe the bible teaches that all ofus are sinnersyes the bible teaches that there is nonegood no not oneso all of us are flawed all of us haveproblems and this country is made up ofindividuals and individuals haveproblems yesbut this country is the greatest countryon the face of the earth with hisconstitutions we'rewe're a nation of laws we're not anation ofthe founders didn't give us a democracythat guaranteed us a republicso we're a nation of laws uh the theconstitutionis not a racist document yeahand so i started to study and researchi i i looked at the democratic thedemocratic party and their foundingsunder andrew jackson in the 1820sand then i looked at the republicanparty and his foundings founded byfreed slave and also uh whiteabolitionistswho were against slavery uh thedemocratic party was in favor of slaveryslavery and and while i'm on thatslavery pointamerica didn't invent slavery slaveryhas been aroundsince the fall but then also in inamericaslavery was imposed upon americaby britain because remember this thisnation started as colonistsand and slavery was imposed upon thisnationand so then when the founders set aboutto to gain their freedoms from britainthen they started to look and say wellhow can we uh cry for our freedomwhen there are uh millions of blackcitizensor black individuals at that time theyweren't citizensuh black individuals who are in slaverywho want their freedom how canthe founders say how can we uh demandour rights and freedomswhen we have people in slavery so theyset about to establish thatand abolish it and certainly by 1854when the republican party was foundedit was founded to end slaveryi mean to do away with it and that was arepublicanuh then of course when they startedpassing legislationthe 13th amendment passed by republicansoneuh republicans in congress in the senatethe 14th amendmentthat basically ended slavery and gaveslaves therights of citizenship passed byrepublicans opposed by democrats15th amendment passed i believe in 1870passed by republicans opposed bydemocratsthen all throughout reconstruction from1867 to 1877legislation passed by republicans aboutfreedblacks freed slaves became politiciansand doctors and lawyersand and landowners and business ownersand free thinkersand educators uh and then of courseafter 1877uh and i forget the uh the greatcompromise i think that's what it wasand it was another close presidentialrace you know like thatthe ones we've had under bush gore uhyou know clinton uh um uhwhat's his name trump so yeah and sothere was a compromise and unfortunatelythings turned aroundand all of the jim crow laws from the1890sall of the jim crow laws were passed bysouthern democrats you know what drivesme crazy is whenwhen you have these talking heads on tvmsnbccnn who are always blaming racism onamericano you need

hi everyone I am so thrilled to bemaking this video because I think it'sabout time that I tell my story abouthow I ran away from the Democraticplantation and how I was always aconservative but I just didn't know itso let's just start off I was born in ElSalvador I lived there for five yearsand then in 2005 we got permission fromthe United States to move to America andit was a very amazing experience but itwas also very hard because we moved heretogether we were here with my uncle'sfamily in a small home no governmenthandouts no food stamps no money noinsurance and on top of that we couldn'teven find an apartment to live inbecause we didn't have credit and we hadjust moved here so even that was wastough and I were going through it all asa family and it was just truly anamazing experience moving cultures andmoving here then 2010 came and we becameUS citizens I really wish I could showmy naturalization certificate because asa picture of me when I was 10 and Isigned it and I became a naturalized UScitizen so that was also one of the bestdays of my life and flash for moveforward to 2015 and I was never intopolitics during all that time neverreally patriotic but that would soonchange so one summer day I was watchingonly BC on and I see this business mancalling out Mexicans and saying thatimmigrants were criminals and rapistsand they were bringing crime and drugsand some were good people and I was soshocked because I just talked about howimmigrants worked so hard in thiscountry yet he was calling them out andsaying that were criminals so I tookoffense to that and I was pissed off andat that point I said the Republicans areracists and the Democratsare for immigrants and for minoritiesthey love us and their kind so that'sthe belief that I had for some timeuntil thankfully I had some friends putme in my place and tell me Melissa themainstream media is focusing on only howhe was calling and me illegal immigrantscriminals and they said that is truemany of them bring crime into thiscountry and they told me how themainstream media never talks about legalimmigrants like me and how we never getanything but they always put their focuson illegal immigration so I said that istrue and I'm still an immigrant how tostick with my people but then I began todo my own research I stopped watchingtelevision and the news channels and Iwatched Hilary's America Clinton cacheand eventually what would be my turningpoint was Obama's America by DineshD'Souza my eyes were opened to so muchthat the media never talks about and Itook offense because I said they loveimmigrants they never talk about howlegal immigrants never get nothing andwe work here and we wait in my case myfamily it was 12 years so at that pointI said I'm being brainwashed in Obama'sAmerica by Dinesh he's talking about howyou know people praise Obama is so cooland all that but his father abandonedhim and he looks up to his father hewent to Africa to meet with Obama'sgrandmother Dinesh and he learned somuch about Obama his mentors weresocialists the things that he does forother countries and not us andeventually it just said this this isn'tfor me the left isn't for me I be I wenton a learning marathon and I justlearned learned learned learned how theorigins of the political parties theRepublicans were the Patriots and theydidn't want slavery and they were forminorities but then I saw that theDemocrats were always for slavery andeven not too long ago they were againstthe Civil Rights Act they were for JimCrow laws and for segregation andsomething just didn't click andeventually I saw that the Democrats havenot changedthey've always exploited peoplesegregated and then I saw that how theywere treating minorities who they saythey love I eventually saw how Democratsare really like I would go in socialmedia and I would post things aboutPresident Trump and I would say Magga orsomething and they would call me atraitor a racist I was too dark to be aconservative I never should have beenconceived and that I should be deportedback to Mexico crazy comments all behindphone screens and I was shocked that theparty that the people that said ifthey're so tolerant or intolerant tothose that are conservatives even theones that they fight for minorities soseeing that I saw and I said this thisis insane and I'm on the right sidebecause even those that claim thatthey're tolerant are not to others thatthink unlike them and at that point andsaid you know I had always been aconservative I didn't know it I saw thispresident yes he was Republican but ontop of that he was just a patriot whowas consistent he was against some warshe always said people were ripping usoff everyone loved him but then when hestarted to say that you know he was aRepublican he started telling truthspeople were all of a sudden offendoffended and this man does not accept asalary he's donating it he gave up hisluxurious lifestyle to work with peopleto be in Washington and fight for us andwe're seeing accomplishment afteraccomplishment whether it's the economywithers in Israel denuclearizationenforcement of immigration laws and I'mso thrilled to be living in this timeperiod we're having probably the bestpresident in history probably of theworld right now and I love this man itwas literally appointed by God thank youGod for for Donald J Trump and I amconstantly seen still the holes withinthe left I'm still seeing how the leftagain is so passionate on something suchas gun control but when it happens indifferent situationsweathers training in New Mexico at acompound for people to execute massshootings silence when RepublicanCongress people get shot in a baseballgame silence from them in Chicago andother urban areas when there's hundredsof people each month dead because ofguns silence on the left feminists whosay they're against the patriarchy wewant equality nobody can tell us what todo or where then we have in Iran thatare women that are taking off theirveils and they're saying we don't wantmen telling us what to wear there'swomen and the Middle East in otherplaces going against what men aretelling him to do but the feministsdon't say probably though I haven't seenor heard anything for my defendant istalking about that and I just keepseeing more and more things about theleft I'm seeing one thing that reallydisgusted me was how our president wasagainst ms-13 and still is but the leftmade it seem like it was talking aboutimmigrants and they said that he wenttoo far calling them animals that isdisgusting I am from El Salvador I knowa thing or two about ms-13 and seeingpeople being shocked and him calling outgangs that blew my mind and that that'sdisgusting of them if Democrats reallydid care about Hispanics they would callout the gangs that are killing Hispanicsin Latin America and in parts of theUnited States the left I mean is soinconsistent you know yoursthey were against illegal immigrationthere's videos of them calling outillegals but now even saying the wordillegal is wrong for them that's why Ilove this president because he's been soconsistent on most things and yeah I'mso thankful for my experiences becausefrom moving here to naturalizationbecause I saw the process the rightprocess of coming here and I've learnedso much in these two years aboutpolitics and just how this country isbattling every day against theestablishment against the swampwe just want American people not justRepublicans just people that supportthose that do the right thing and comehere the right way and I'm so thankfulfor this president and literally it isjust up and down not left or right soyeah that's a little bit of what I'velearned during these years conservativeswe got to keep speaking out on socialmedia in schools at our work and let'skeep fighting for this country I'mreally happy to be here and really happyto be here during these times and yeahso thank you so much for watching andlet's keep America greathi everyone I am so thrilled to bemaking this video because I think it'sabout time that I tell my story abouthow I ran away from the Democraticplantation and how I was always aconservative but I

day against theestablishment against the swampwe just want American people not justRepublicans just people that supportthose that do the right thing and comehere the right way and I'm so thankfulfor this president and literally it isjust up and down not left or right soyeah that's a little bit of what I'velearned during these years conservativeswe got to keep speaking out on socialmedia in schools at our work and let'skeep fighting for this country I'mreally happy to be here and really happyto be here during these times and yeahso thank you so much for watching andlet's keep America greathi everyone I am so thrilled to bemaking this video because I think it'sabout time that I tell my story abouthow I ran away from the Democraticplantation and how I was always aconservative but I just didn't know itso let's just start off I was born in ElSalvador I lived there for five yearsand then in 2005 we got permission fromthe United States to move to America andit was a very amazing experience but itwas also very hard because we moved heretogether we were here with my uncle'sfamily in a small home no governmenthandouts no food stamps no money noinsurance and on top of that we couldn'teven find an apartment to live inbecause we didn't have credit and we hadjust moved here so even that was wastough and I were going through it all asa family and it was just truly anamazing experience moving cultures andmoving here then 2010 came and we becameUS citizens I really wish I could showmy naturalization certificate because asa picture of me when I was 10 and Isigned it and I became a naturalized UScitizen so that was also one of the bestdays of my life and flash for moveforward to 2015 and I was never intopolitics during all that time neverreally patriotic but that would soonchange so one summer day I was watchingonly BC on and I see this business mancalling out Mexicans and saying thatimmigrants were criminals and rapistsand they were bringing crime and drugsand some were good people and I was soshocked because I just talked about howimmigrants worked so hard in thiscountry yet he was calling them out andsaying that were criminals so I tookoffense to that and I was pissed off andat that point I said the Republicans areracists and the Democratsare for immigrants and for minoritiesthey love us and their kind so that'sthe belief that I had for some timeuntil thankfully I had some friends putme in my place and tell me Melissa themainstream media is focusing on only howhe was calling and me illegal immigrantscriminals and they said that is truemany of them bring crime into thiscountry and they told me how themainstream media never talks about legalimmigrants like me and how we never getanything but they always put their focuson illegal immigration so I said that istrue and I'm still an immigrant how tostick with my people but then I began todo my own research I stopped watchingtelevision and the news channels and Iwatched Hilary's America Clinton cacheand eventually what would be my turningpoint was Obama's America by DineshD'Souza my eyes were opened to so muchthat the media never talks about and Itook offense because I said they loveimmigrants they never talk about howlegal immigrants never get nothing andwe work here and we wait in my case myfamily it was 12 years so at that pointI said I'm being brainwashed in Obama'sAmerica by Dinesh he's talking about howyou know people praise Obama is so cooland all that but his father abandonedhim and he looks up to his father hewent to Africa to meet with Obama'sgrandmother Dinesh and he learned somuch about Obama his mentors weresocialists the things that he does forother countries and not us andeventually it just said this this isn'tfor me the left isn't for me I be I wenton a learning marathon and I justlearned learned learned learned how theorigins of the political parties theRepublicans were the Patriots and theydidn't want slavery and they were forminorities but then I saw that theDemocrats were always for slavery andeven not too long ago they were againstthe Civil Rights Act they were for JimCrow laws and for segregation andsomething just didn't click andeventually I saw that the Democrats havenot changedthey've always exploited peoplesegregated and then I saw that how theywere treating minorities who they saythey love I eventually saw how Democratsare really like I would go in socialmedia and I would post things aboutPresident Trump and I would say Magga orsomething and they would call me atraitor a racist I was too

hey everyone its home I I don't know tensubscribers thanks I I don't know ifyou're gonna subscribe after this but Ihave been following the walk awaymovement and I couldn't stay silent Ihave to add my voice I've been sofrightened to speak out over the lastyear and this movement has made merealize how important it is to make surethat my voice is heard and that my voiceis added to the what is it now a millionpeople that are talking about this sovery quickly like many people in thismovement I was a Bernie supporter Ivoted for him in the primaries I endedup choosing to vote for Clinton in theactual election her an email I receivedfrom the Bernie campaign maybe a weekweek or two before you know the actualelection she asked all of his followersto vote for her I ignored the fact thatI didn't trust her and took hisdirection I wish that I hadn't inhindsight I don't know if I'd vote forBernie today but I should have stuck tomy principles and written him in uh Iregret that I didn't do thatbut once Trump won like many people Iwas afflicted with Trump derangementsyndrome as it's being referred to Ithink I even even outright said onFacebook that if you're my friend andyou voted for Trump you should unfriendmeI I feel horrible that I acted that waytowards some people that had beenfriends of mine for a long time and ifif you're watching this and you want tocontinue that conversation my my earsare open now and a big part of thatinitial opening that that blindfoldcoming down was actually seeing theresponse to my LOI innopolis appearanceat Berkeley in February of 2017 I'm sureyou guys remember the footage youremember people going absolutely insanebreaking windows throwing I think oneone guy was throwing a podium orsomething I don't know people were goingcrazy and I thought oh my god that thisguy must be the Nazi that that everyonesays he is for them to act this way andI actually made the mistake of lookinginto what he was actually saying ofcourse I don't agree with everything hesays I don't think any of us agree witheverything that Milo says but I'd betotally remiss if I didn't thank him forthat initial i opening that initialblindfold slippage seeing how some of myleft friends were reacting to a youngman showing up at a college wanting tospeak it went against every ideal i heldas an american as a staunch defender ofthe constitution freedom of speech isincredibly important to me I'm an actorI am an artistI'm a writer if I didn't have my FirstAmendment right I wouldn't have any ofthe things that bring me joy in life tosee people that I thought werereasonable actually advocating thatother people should have their freedomof speech limited because we don't agreewith them that is the most insane scaryconcept I can't even I can't even fathomthat there are people I call friendsthat believe that and it was those samefriends that then sort of contributed tofurther pushing me away starting to tryto talk about this starting to try totalk about the things I was seeing toexpress concern about people that wereadvocating for the limiting of ourrights for the limiting of ourconstitutional rights it it it blows mymind to think about it and to havefriends call you a racist call yousexist call you an anti-feminist becauseyou believe that everyone should betreated equally all it does is justfurther alienate me and alienate therest of us and push us towards oneanother and inspire this movement thatwe need to talk about the worst of itfor me was a couple weeks ago whenI started talking about border controland immigration I don't see how wantinga strong working immigration policy iswrong I don't see how that makes me abigot but I was talking to my motherabout it the other week and and sheturned and looked at me and made aderogatory comment about my whitenessshe is Hispanic I am mixed I've beenmade fun of my whole life for beingmixed for never fitting in with thewhite people never fitting in with thebrown people being told by one half thatI'm too dark being told by the otherhalf I'm too lightI've never really felt a part of anykind of racial identity maybe that's whyI really identify as being an Americanbeing an American is something thatsurpasses color it surpasses creed it iteven surpasses country of origin this isan amazing country and I love being anAmerican and I love anyone who holdsAmerican ideals up so highly that theywould be willing to leave their homecountry to come here I'm so for that I'mso all about that and to have my ownmother turn and look at me and use myrace as an insult I don't think any anyany mother should do that I don't thinkanyone who really loves you and caresabout you should do that and that waswhy I decided to add my voice to thismovement because I am very scared tospeak up and talk about how I feel and II'm not even conservative I I'm not inany way close to being a Republican II'm pro-choice I'm Pro welfare I'm Prolegal immigration I I just also happento be Pro First Amendment and I am abeliever in the Second Amendment I thinkeveryone should have the right to defendthemselves protect themselves especiallyas a woman I have a right to walk downthe street and even the playing field byarming myselfapparently those kind of ideas nowadayswill get you labeled a racist they'llget you labeled a Nazi they'll get youlabeled a bigot when really the war thewar because we're so we're so worked upand tuned up right now but the realbattle I think should be against thebigotry of low expectations that ispermeating every culture in this in thiscountry you know the real issue is thatwe have a news media that answers tocorporate sponsors not to actuallyconveying real news and sadly themajority of Americans are getting theirnews from those sources somehow in thelast year advocating for freedom ofthought has become a radical notion andI am sorry to anyone who I tuned out inthe past I am sorry to everyone like mewho's getting shunned who's gettinginsulted by friends by family justbecause you want to be able to think foryourself and you want to be able toadvocate that everyone should bethinking for themselves what's going onis a real shame
hi everybodyi'm jessica boss and this is why iwalked awayin my teens i considered myself apoliticali used to say politics don't affect mei was raised in texas and i held liberalideologies by default becausemy parents echoed those ideologies eventhoughthey also said that they were apoliticalone day i watched a group of right-wingchristians on the newsholding up signs telling gays they wouldburn in hellbeing a christian myself i hated seeingpeople who call themselves christiansdisplay such hate and judgment thatjesusnever taught so i immediately made adistinction betweenmyself and those hateful christianrepublicansin my early twenties i still maintainedthat i was apoliticalbut i identified as and voted democratbecause i was told to and i believe thatthey were the party of love intoleranceand i assumed that everybody elsethought the same way i did becausei had just moved to los angeles themelting potand we're progressive here unlike theold-fashioned south where i'm from andi'm an actor filmmakersurrounded by other actors and industrypeople who areall on the left and consider themselvesgood people whowalked the moral high ground so whathappenedmy husband happened we became friendsthrough an acting class and we wouldtalk long after class was overand one day one of the ladies in classbrought up the whole gay marriage issuebecausethere was a prop something being votedonand i said it doesn't matter love isloveafter class mike asked me if i knew thefull details of what was beingvoted on and feeling blindsided andattacked i retorted that i didn't carebecauseit's an anti-gay bill and politics don'taffect me anywayshe challenged me and said that it indeeddidaffect me in the big picture whether ibelieved it or nothe shared his view on how theproposition was not against gay peopleat alljust pro-traditional marriage and takinga stance against the judge thatoverruled the will of the people in thefirst placethen then he posed the questionif love was all that mattered what stopsa man from marrying three womenor a father from marrying his 12 yearold daughteri was stumped that nevereven crossed my mind and it was then irealized that i only had oneside of the story when i wasn't asinterested in somethingsuch as politics i generally formed aquickfully biased uneducated opinion ontopics based onsound bites that were catchy what otherpeople told meor what i saw or feltnot on research let alone factsand that made me question everythingwhen i started doing my own research irealized thati really didn't know anything aboutpolitics let alone the democratic partyi quickly learned that traditionalfamilies represented the building blocksof societyi learned that the democratic partyfoundedthe kkk and they opposed all majorcivil rights initiatives and they werethe party of slaverysegregation jim crow laws and lynchingsbut it didn't stop there i then realizedthat the democratic party was full ofbad ideaslike big government high taxes politicalcorrectnesstoxic masculinity white privilegeopen borders sanctuary cities defundingthe policelate term and post-birth abortionsocialismaffirmative action identity politics andso on and so forthbut it became very clear that the leftwas anti-businessanti-free speech anti-gunanti-capitalismanti-constitution anti-christmasanti-police and very often anti-babyand anti-american and worst of allanti-godthat's when i fully woke up i now knowthat the mediais one of the main culprits theycherry-pick what they want to showbased on their agenda and sell it astruththat's exactly what they did with theright-wing christians who held uphateful signsthe news chose to highlight those veryfew particular radical fundamentalistchristiansto represent all christians andtherefore try to paint the picture thatwe're all hateful homophobes that'sfalsei've been to so many churches and i'venever seen a christian act in thatdespicableway in fact most of the pastors thati've seenhave verbally condemned those hatefulactions of the verysmall minority of radicalfundamentalistsafter seeing the way that the mediamilked news storiesthat furthered their own um that furthertheir own agendaby selling fear and most of all fakeracismi knew that they were no longer thetrusted source that they claim to bei'm now a lot more educated and moreinvolved in what's going on in our worldand because i now see the liesthat are being spread by the mainstreammedia controlled bypeople who want to push their own agendaand desiresi've walked away from the democraticpartyif you're also on the fence becauseyou'redisgusted or confused by what you'reseeing going on in the newsand what's happening in today's world iimplore youto do your own research seek out thetruthget educated and walk away from fearbondage lies victimhoodthe plantation mentality and deceptionfirst corinthians 2 5 says your faithdoes not rest in the wisdom of menbut in the power of god we're not meantto besheep blindly doing what people tell usto dowe're meant to put our faith in god'spower and in doing his willmy name is jessica boss and i am sohappy i walked away

attention to when he came onthe newshe's like the Charlie Brown adults inthe Charlie Brown cartoon walk walk walkwalk walk I didn't understand anythingany politician said but I hated theWatergate hearings because they werepre-empting my TV shows that I wanted towatch in the middle of afternoon Iwanted watch Star Trek I wanted to watchbewitched I wanted to watch Gilligan'sIsland those were my TV shows I was 12years old I wanted to watch my TV showsand I didn't understand what the heck isa WatergateI go look at it out the window they'regating or fences so you know how do youmake a gate out of water I didn't knowI watched a little bit of the Watergatehearings and they weren't explained whata Watergate was so look I just turnedthe TV off and finally later on monthslater he was he had resigned and I washappy because he was out of office and Iget my and I didn't have to worry aboutwhether I was going to get my TV thatafternoon or not but my next experiencewas in 1977-78 I had caught on the radiothis guy talking about politics and wastalking about America and he was talkingabout he just had a short two or threeminute speech and I would listen to himI got the point where I would listen tohim religiously I realized he was onevery day or every weekday and his namewas Ronald Reagan and I really he talkedabout individual freedom individualempowerment how great this country wasand all we needed to do was empower theindividual the government didn't solveanything and I realize he really wastalking to me and and and and my beliefsthis country is great and all we need todo is empower people to be the best theycan be and it's this not up togovernment to make me who I am it's upto me I really believe that so every dayI get a hideaway for the two or threemen to use on in my in my room left mylittle transistor radio you're notlistening to Ronald Reagan I asked mycivics teacher who the heck is thisRonald Reagan and she explained to methat he he had run for president he wasgovernor of California and so anyway inin the fall of 79 he said his this is mylast radio show because I'm running forpresident so Wow I so okay so I had tohave I had to do whatever I could do toget Ronald Reagan to be President so Ihad raking bumper stickers I passed themout I was going to college at the time Ipassed him out on ranking stickers Iwent to the Oh youth football games andI passed Reagan bumper stickers out Idid whatever I could to get him electedand and he was elected in a landslide Iwas happy so anyway but I also realizehey why isn't the Republican Partyreally supporting Reagan and hispolicies throughout his his his tenureand I learned of what they called theRockefeller Republicans who reallydidn't care about people they're kind oflike the the never Trump errs today theywere the never Reagan's back then soanyway I'm trying to make a lot makingthis too long but I was kind of fed up Istill love Ronald Reagan but I was kindof fed up with all the Republicans so bythe time he won his landslidere-election and getting into second termI had graduated college at gotten a joband I've gotten a couple of friends andthis is the other half of my story I ama gay man and I was I knew when I wasprobably eight or ten years old that'sbeen 1970 72 time time frame that I wasgay I didn't understand hardly anythingwhat that meant but I would go to schooland with my friends there was this othereverybody knew this other boy in ourclass was kind of very feminine and Idid not want to be that guy I did notwant to be treated the way that guy wastreated the humiliation everybody wouldtalk about him behind back so I went into the closet then I I could not be gayand I did everything I could to bestraight and and I carried thatthroughout my my schooling and into myadult life but anyway these two friendsI had in the late 80s they were gay andthey befriended me and I guess becausethey knew I was gay even those do mybest to hide it in any way they can Iwas kind of floundering I didn't know Imean regular was getting ready to leaveoffice I didn't know who who doessupport and they were telling me abouthow well you know Reagan really wasn'tthat great of a president wasn't thatgreat of a person he fired all the gaysthat worked for the state when he wasgovernor of Californiathe reason AIDS was around at that timewas because he delayed he purposefullydelayed researching into the gate intothe AIDS epidemic and I bought into whatthey were saying they were also sayinghow you knowyeah these Rockefeller Republicans theyonly care about their their their moneyand their rich friends they didn't careabout the poor people it was theDemocrats that cared about the poorpeople that's why they supported welfareit was the Democrats that that caredabout the working-class people that'swhy they supported the unions it wasDemocrats who were who who weren'tracist there was the Democrats who whoweren't homophobes and I bought into allof that and that identity politicsbecause honestly the Republicans didn'thave anything the answer to that soanyway so I bought into that so in 88I voted for Dukakis and 92 and 96 Ivoted for Clinton and in 2000 2004 Ivoted for gore and then Kerry so I willI bought into all of that but itthroughout this whole time I was also inmy in my closet and I've even gotmarried to a woman that I really dearlyloved but there's a difference betweenloving someone as a person in love withsomeone in a romantic sense and that didnot workso anyway by the late 90s my marriage inmy life was overI I asked God I said I don't understandwhat I'm going through what do I need todo show me and so he showed me I wasinto alcoholism he showed me that I wasgoing getting into drugs and I waseither one gonna be killed by drugs orkilled by my own hand so I asked forhelp and to make a long story short I Igot helpI got counseling I got into a a 12-stepprogram and my counselors sent me to soyou go to all these meetings but here'swhat I want you to go to it was a aa a meeting specifically for notspecific religion not exclusively forgay gay and lesbian crowd but it cateredand they were most of the members weregay and lesbians and they really helpedme come out so they became my newfriends in in they helped me not onlycome out in the AAA program but alsocome out as a gay man and live and becomfortable with myself so yeah soeverything was fine they still believedlike I did that you know I mean I evenhad a Democrats care bumper stickerDemocrats care about poor people thatcare about working-class people theycare about blacks and care about gaysand lesbians so anyway so 2008 comesalong so I voted for Elise and okaythere's this Barack Obama and I didn'tyou know I mean I followed politics Ididn't know who this guy wasI knew who who all the other posters butthis was a guy just all of a sudden outof the blue came upon the sceneeverybody was talking about how he wasgoing to be Presidenthe was gonna be the Democraticnomination I didn't understand who theheck he was and they weren't reallytalking about him so I decided I wasgoing to do my own research whoopsthat's not what the Democrats andliberals want you to do so I found outabout him I found out how radical he washe wasn't just a Liberal Democrat he wasan avowed socialist and radical not justa socialist but a radical socialist andhe hated America I found speeches of hisfrom a blimp I guess it was ColumbiaUniversity and I think I've found I'veheard an audio of one of his speeches Imean it was so but anyway my friendswere still I mean I were going to votefor Obama and one lady sent an emailbroadcast email this wasn't Facebookwasn't really big never sent out abroadcast email about how the theprimaries were starting well I mean letme backone step here I found out how after Ifound out how rapidly was I decided I'mjust not going to vote for him I'm gonnavote for Hillary in the primary so and Ithought in you know what's the media whois honest and always tells the truthonce the media came out with who BarackObama's that's who everybody was goingto to gravitate to anyway so she wasgonna be the the 2008 Democratic nomineewell the media didn't uh and I was kindof having an out-of-body experiencethrough the whole winter of 2007-2008 iswhat why is the Tim why is the media notexposing this guy for whom he is isn'tthat third job I didn't understand soanyway the primary started in the latewinter and finally something and theystill weren't telling the truth andfinally one lady in in our in our groupsent out a broadcast email I meanfacelock said Facebook wasn't reallyaround if that big so everybodycommunicated a lot through broadcastemails and in in our group and she saidwell we're finally going to figure outwhether America is still a racistcountry or not and I couldn't believethat I thought so I sent out a reply andsaid I'm not gonna vote for Obama thisis why I'm not gonna vote for Obamait's not because he's black it's becauseI don't like his policies is becausehere is who he is a radical a socialistwho hates this country and all of asudden I was banished I was banished howdare you I reply hey I'm voting for himthere's not a racist no you're a racistI mean you know I don't we don't wantyou coming to our group meetings wedon't want you any I mean I was shunnedby all my friends on my support group soI was devastated so I and still I was Iwas in my out-of-body experience to awhole 2008 primaries I I could notunderstand why the media was notexposing Obama for who he was and I wasdevastated that I lost all of my friendsI didn't know what to do I mean and Istarted doing listening and doing my ownresearch and not just blindly I mean ifthey were lying about Obama what elsewere they lying about so I started doingmy ownsearch and finally I did I said you knowthey're they're lying all the time thatI finally said okay here's the big liewere they even raw lying about this guythat they told me is a is a racist as ahomophobe he's a his name was RushLimbaugh I said well if they're lyingabout it everything else did they lie tome about Rush Limbaugh so I decided tolisten to Rush Limbaugh I startedlistening to Rush Limbaugh in 2008 andhe was I learned after listen to herwhile he was not a racist he's not ahomophobe matter of fact a lot of whathe was talking about he was channellingwhat I really liked about about RonaldReagan and and I I did not understandwhy I mean then that was that was kindof my moment said okay these liberalsand Democrats in the media they're allliars you know I started listening torush limbaugh's to kind of open my eyesto it's not just what he was saying butto also I realized that that what Iliked about Ronald Reagan was true I didresearch about Ronald Reagan RonaldReagan did not fire all the stateemployee all the state gay employees hedid not delayresearch into aids there were somepeople around in his administration thatprevented his knowledge about thesituation in in the early times of AIDSbut as soon as it was he was approachedby his health and human services guyabout the problem and he said okay whatdo we need so I mean I found all of thisout and also I mean I I found one otherthing that I didn't even know about thatthey were they were silent and here'shere's one of the when I read on awebsite in 1978 when California was onthe verge of passing a state ballotinitiative that would ban openly gayteachers it was Ronald Reagan'sopposition to that chained to that itwas wrong it was Reagan's oppositionthat changed public opinion he had beenlobbied to weigh in by sirgay rights activists and so he did whichif you think about what he was trying todo in 1978 win over conservatives thatwas pretty policy and yes so you can'ttell me that someone who came out a yearbefore he was going to announce hissecond run for the presidency a yearbefore that that he would come out andbasically kill a California state ballotinitiative that would ban openly gayteachers he's not a homophobe and he isnot anti-gay so don't you know I meanI'm not buying that yet but they don'ttell you this the liberals don't tellyou this so you know I mean that openedmy eyes and from then on I I do myresearch that's not what they want theydidn't want me I'm if I'd have done myresearch back in 88 I never would havebeen a liberal I never been a liberalDemocrat you know but I mean theRepublican Party is not perfect I meanthere's I mean they were RockefellerRepublicans back then they're neverTrump versus basically they're the samepeople I think if you did a lineal flowfrom the Rockefeller Republicans in thenever Trump errs today I think you'd seethem connect I think you see connectionsdefinite connections between them I meanthere there were a lot of good I meanwhen you have Buckley Buckley III listento a lot of him after after I finallywalked away from the Democratic Partyand the liberal mantra but and so therewere some that I really liked but youknow I mean do you own research andthat's what I do I sin that's why I'm abig Trump for today I mean I liked whathe was saying I do not like the neverTrump words I don't I still do not likethose that that they what I call theRepublican establishment the RockefellerRepublicans the never Trump ORS I meanthey're just they're elitists I don'tlike them so I mean rep RepublicanParty's not perfect but we got a guythat I mean he does care I meanso I just encourage everyone to you knowwalk away and to find your own path andyou know choose your own path[Music]
my name is Lucretia Hughes and this willbe my walkaway story I've been seeing alot of people out there in the UnitedStatesgiven a testimony of one of the reasonswhy they left the Democratic SocialistParty of America that's their new namefor me I understood and realized thatthe Democrats was not the type of partythat I need to be affiliated with waswhen they went against everything that Iwas raised upon I always tell people mystory started when I was 15 and I had myvery first son by the time I was 20 Ihad my fourth child I have lived in theprojects I have been on everyentitlement program probably out therebut it took me into the age of 25 towake up you know I was heavily in theDemocratic Party in helping outDemocrats when I was in my 20s becausethat's the only thing I knew to do Imean that's all I knew being who I waswas you stick with Democrats becauseyou're black so I didn't know any betterwhen I started really paying attentionand I always say I do Barack Obamacredit where credit is duehe woke me up to the point of getting memore active in politics and stumping forhim and getting out there and knockingon doors and making sure I got his wordout so that made me kind of wake up andrealize that okay first we got our firstvery true person african-american thatis going to change the world and give ushope and change and I fell into all ofthat at that time because I didn't knowany better and then I started waking upto the fact that he woke me up to payingattention to politics but it woke me upto watching him not onlyin my real parents they always taught meabout the Democrats is that you knowthere for the people they are for thepeople you know they're they're therefor the people the white man's gonnakeep you down you know you know it'salways that mentality and I startedthinking it's like wait a minute I havefour kidsI have Walton life why am i associatedwith a party that is not really helpingout the black community at all and thenI went to a meeting and asked could Irun for office for my community becauseI saw a lot of things happening in theblack community that I did not like andthey said I had to wait my turnexcuse me what do you mean I have towait my turn that means that it's not mytime within the Democratic Party becauseI can't count k'tau down to what theyhave to push out there that kind of gaveme of all hope until Barack Obama butwhen he

walk away campaign Brian to Healey heredown in LouisianaI want to thank Brandon first off forstarting this campaign I think it'sgiven a voice to a lot of people thatfelt they didn't have a voice anymore Ialso want to thank our president a man Ivoted for after a lifetime a whole adultlifetime of being a Democrat halfwaythrough the last year's of Obama'ssecond administration I realized that Ihad been living in the wrong laneI saw the Democratic Party go in adirection and take this country in adirection that I I didn't even see it asAmerica anymore I saw us just given thiscountry away I saw things happening inour country that I'd never seen my storyis simple I'm 61 years old I know thatthere's much younger people andbetter-looking people on this campaignthan me but I felt it important to tellmy storyI'm originally from Michigan grew upbecause of my roots and everything was alifelong Democrat came down here youused to have a lot of healthy debateswith my older brother who was aconservative and a Republican for manyyears about the Democratic Party votedfor Bill Clinton thought he was doing agreat job until he really disgraced theoffice and I started to get a littleturned off back then about theDemocratic Party but really couldn't seeswitching right at that time then AlongCame Bush at the time I thought Bush wasgood for our country because of 9/11 Ifelt like he was a good president tohaveoffice until we got into the Iraq warand saw where that was really asenseless war for us to be in a lot ofyoung men and women lost their lives forno reason over theremy oldest son served over in that warand it was a scary time for my wife andI we have three sonsI saw our state as time progressed andObama won and I thought okay there'sgoing to be true change he he's talkingabout hope and change and bringing thecountry together again I didn't see thathappening I saw our country get moredivided I saw you know if you were aconservative you were being you knowpersecuted and penalized and andeverything else and and and it upset meand I thought wait a minute something'swrong here I had a quite a healthexperience back in 2015 I spent threemonths in the hospital I actually theylost me a couple of times in thehospital and when I got out I was sofrustrated with the way things weregoing in our country I saw all thispolitical correctness I saw prayer leavethe schools I saw the national anthemnot even being sung at you know thestart of football games anymoreI saw principals who were getting firedand let go of because they they wereallowing the kids to pray before a gameand gather and and to me that was anAmerica that isn't the way we werefounded it wasn't how we started thiscountry in the way this country wasbrought up we always said the Pledge ofAllegiance we always said a prayer inschool family was important to us I camefrom a broken home I've been on my ownsince I was 13I now have the greatest family in theworld I worried about my three sons mythree daughter-in-laws as to how theywere going to provide for their kidsthen all of a sudden Trump came along atfirst I wasn't really excited aboutTrumpI liked what he was saying but thenthere were a lot of things he said thatkind of made me cringe and some of histweets and sometimes he'd get out therebut but as I listened to him I saw a manthat I truly felt had nothing but thiscountry in his heart he had no reasonfor doing this he had never been inpolitics he had all the money a mancould want very successful business andit just started to dawn on me that heyhe's really meaning what he's saying hewants America to become great again hewants America back to where it was backto where there was there was you knowopportunity for everyone he wanted tosee industry come back and and jobs comeback and that was important to mebecause I live in a state that jobs wereleaving left and right the small town welive in dried up there were no jobs theyoung people had to move off to findwork and now things have changed and youcan say what you want to about Trump andand everything else I know he's still Isometimes I wish you wouldn't we but Idon't care I am in behind him I havewalked away from the Democratic Partyand I feel such relief and and I feelhope againthere was a time of about a year agowhere I really didn't care how muchlonger I went on I used to tell my wifeI just don't see much hope for ourcountry I feel for our grandkids andwhat's going to happen to them and andbut now I feel hope again I feel thereis a true change on the horizon andevery day they go after him but I tellyou what I'm here to support him andBrandon again thank you for thismovement I'd have never done anythinglike this before and thank you allwalk away campaign Brian to Healey heredown in LouisianaI want to

that was really asenseless war for us to be in a lot ofyoung men and women lost their lives forno reason over theremy oldest son served over in that warand it was a scary time for my wife andI we have three sonsI saw our state as time progressed andObama won and I thought okay there'sgoing to be true change he he's talkingabout hope and change and bringing thecountry together again I didn't see thathappening I saw our country get moredivided I saw you know if you were aconservative you were being you knowpersecuted and penalized and andeverything else and and and it upset meand I thought wait a minute something'swrong here I had a quite a healthexperience back in 2015 I spent threemonths in the hospital I actually theylost me a couple of times in thehospital and when I got out I was sofrustrated with the way things weregoing in our country I saw all thispolitical correctness I saw prayer leavethe schools I saw the national anthemnot even being sung at you know thestart of football games anymoreI saw principals who were getting firedand let go of because they they wereallowing the kids to pray before a gameand gather and and to me that was anAmerica that isn't the way we werefounded it wasn't how we started thiscountry in the way this country wasbrought up we always said the Pledge ofAllegiance we always said a prayer inschool family was important to us I camefrom a broken home I've been on my ownsince I was 13I now have the greatest family in theworld I worried about my three sons mythree daughter-in-laws as to how theywere going to provide for their kidsthen all of a sudden Trump came along atfirst I wasn't really excited aboutTrumpI liked what he was saying but thenthere were a lot of things he said thatkind of made me cringe and some of histweets and sometimes he'd get out therebut but as I listened to him I saw a manthat I truly felt had nothing but thiscountry in his heart he had no reasonfor doing this he had never been inpolitics he had all the money a mancould want very successful business andit just started to dawn on me that heyhe's really meaning what he's saying hewants America to become great again hewants America back to where it was backto where there was there was you knowopportunity for everyone he wanted tosee industry come back and and jobs comeback and that was important to mebecause I live in a state that jobs wereleaving left and right the small town welive in dried up there were no jobs theyoung people had to move off to findwork and now things have changed and youcan say what you want to about Trump andand everything else I know he's still Isometimes I wish you wouldn't we but Idon't care I am in behind him I havewalked away from the Democratic Partyand I feel such relief and and I feelhope againthere was a time of about a year agowhere I really didn't care how muchlonger I went on I used to tell my wifeI just don't see much hope for ourcountry I feel for our grandkids andwhat's going to happen to them and andbut now I feel hope again I feel thereis a true change on the horizon andevery day they go after him but I tellyou what I'm here to support him andBrandon again thank you for thismovement I'd have never done anythinglike this before and thank you all
hi my name is David Montiel and this ismy hashtag walkaway video I walked fromI walked away from the Democratic PartyI would say at least fifteen years agoand I was just very frustrated with thepolicies how they changed over time andit just very frustrated the gas pricesthe way there why they were so high whywere all these social programs all thetime why were they paying for all thosethings and as time went by I could seewhen I voted somebody into office whenthey got into office it's like theychanged I guess you call progressivismbut one day cheap it's like they changedand I didn't like that you know I wantedyou know somebody that would you knowjust be straightforward and do what theysay in office as well as on the campaigntrail so this is my walk away video I'ma little nervous but that's the way itis right now I just not used to talkingto a cameramy son's timing it too so I'd get threeminutes out of it so anyway what's goingon is this look when I look at theDemocratic Party now and I see all thehate and vitriol and how I'm considereda racist even though I'm a Christian I'mconsidered a racist I'm a considered aNazi this because I support PresidentTrump or because my views don't line upwith somebody else's that's not the wayit's supposed to bewe're posed to have civil discourse inthis country in the past you know 20years ago 25 years ago we could talkabout something political and we couldyou know debate about it a little bitand agree to disagree and walk away asfriends now you know there's people thatare just have lost family members as faras you know no communication you knowbasically excommunicated the familybecause maybe like either me or somebodyelse supported a president Trump thathasn't happened to me but I've heard ofseveral walk away testimonial videoswhere that has happened and I just don'tthink that's really right at all I thinkthose countries in the wrong directionI'm from California and I can seeCalifornia being backwards in manypolicies the sanctuary City policiesmany other policies and I'm glad Iwalked away from the Democratic Party nolonger suits me and no longer suits mymorals no longer suits my convictions soif you're a Democrat and you're thinkingabout you know your your party justremember just remember this it's notjust a party anymore you can see it justwatch just watch the the CNN or MSNBC orany other programs and you'll see you'llsee how they're biased against Trumpyou'll see how they're biased againstsomebody like me maybe when you'reyou're a fellow brother or sister inChrist that goes to your same church soI just want to let you know that rightnowI'm just happy that I'm joined thishashtag walk away movement we're havinga meet and greets I'll be hosting oneprobably next month actually this nextmonth on March 20 1939 San Jose so hopeto see you guys there god bless you godbless your Patriots as we walk away[Music]you
it's time to explain why I walked awaywhen I came to America I thought notmuch about politics who really wants tobe interested in politics all the timebut when I did give it a thought Ithought that because I was not from herebecause I was not a member of a countryclub because I was brown and not whitethat there was really only one partythat would have me and I never gave itanother thought in college a member ofthe Young Republicans said to me do youthink that you should get to decide whatto do with the money you make and I saidyeah and he said when you have kids doyou think you should be able to raisethem as you see fitand I thought yeah and then I stillthought there was some sort of unwrittenrule against people like me joining theRepublican Party so when I became a UScitizen I was declined to state voterit's the largest growing partyaffiliation in my state of Californiaand that's where I was happy to becauseI'm a fiercely independent person Idon't want to be a member and put into abox of any particular party but then asa parent and as a business owner as anactress I started looking around atthings that were going wrong here in mystate and I realized they were allcoming from one side and I also realizedthat people were yelling at me andsaying you can't to be a member of agroup because of the color your skinwhich I'm pretty sure was the textbookdefinition of racism so I started doinghomework and I decided that I reallywanted to join a party and I wanted tojoin a party that freed the slaves Iwanted to join the party that fought forcivil rights I wanted to join the partythat didn't inter japanese-americans inthe Second World War and I wanted tojoin the partythat really stood for freedom forleaving people alone to be American todo what they want to dotheir lives and their money in theirtime and that turns out to be theRepublican Party and so that's why Iwalked away and that's why I'm runningbecause I actually want to stay in thisgreat state of Californiait's

Cherokees were forcedWest forced out their landwell that was Andrew Jackson he was aDemocrat and from Tennessee I believeand if you move forward to the Civil Warit was the Democratic Party theDemocrats in the South that were forslavery and it was a Republicans in thenorth that fought against slavery andthere were some more issues to the CivilWar but the slavery was on the mainissues to keep it from going westwardand it was the Republican Party thatfought and a Republicans from the northand many Republicans from the southyes there was especially this area thatI live in East Tennessee was pro-unionthat fault and spilt blood to free theblack man from bondage and no whenPresident Lincoln was assassinated hewas assassinated by John Wilkes Booth aDemocrat and then Andrew Johnson at thetime you know back then whoever got thesecond most votes was the vice presidentso Andrew Johnson was vice presidentunder Lincoln and when Lincoln wasassassinated Andrew Johnson a Democratbecame president and then you startedseeing all the progress that had beenmade start going downhill and it wasn'tlong after that to the Democrats formedthe Ku Klux Klan and they incitedviolence they lynched blacks they killedblacks they hung them they burnedcrosses in her yard and they did thatfor years and the Klan still going todayand it's just the Democratic Party isjust just a history of its excessiveracism and the Jim Crow laws in thesouth they were implemented by Democratsyou remember the DixiecratsWallace in 1968 you know they wereagainst equal rights for blacks theywere against the 13th amendment whichabolished slavery the 14th and the 15thamendments which established citizenshipand right voter rights and they wereagainst that it was a Republican Partythat fought for that and you know LyndonJohnson famously is said that he wouldhave those in words voting a Democratfor 200 years and because he put in theGreat Society was a welfare state andpretty much black women were told thatif they divorce their husbands there aslong as they were single that thegovernment would take care of them givethem housing take care of their babiesas long as there wasn't a father in

this is my walkaway video I walked awayfrom really both Republicans andDemocrats I've been an independent on mylife since we registering I did switchto Republican just so I could vote forTrump in the primaries although I sawafter Trump I'll probably switch back toindependent I like being able to look atall sides and pick who I wantI don't want to be bailing to one of theother really my problem that I had is Istarted seeing a lot of corruption inour government and I had two lifeexperiences that really reallyhighlighted this and it seems relevantto todayway back when during the Simmons andLoan scandals the FBI went after myfather for embezzlement small branch inLouisiana nothing he didn't do anythingwe had no money for a lawyer even alongtime friend came up and became ourlawyer just volunteered went to courtand the whole case was the FBI's stoodup there and said I'm with the FBI trustme there was no evidence no anything andthen the court to us furious the judgewas furious he threw it out and thenafterwards the FBI agents ever heardsaying that it didn't matter he just hadto have a certain number of cases go tocourt so he could get a promotionhe had SiC the FBI on all the dad'sfriends were into all of them were inpeople's lives for nothing just so hecould get a promotion since then I nevertrust the FBI on anything even the FBIrank and file I'm sorry but I don'tafter that that showed me their colorsand I knew something was wrong againmoved fast forward moved to the DallasFort Worth area loved itdear 9/11 became an avid watcher of CNNand Rachel Maddow and all the city talkmorning talk shows loved all that ate itup just addicted to all of that stilltrying to figure out what's going onwith our government never could reallyfigure it outstill can't hardly but then a fastforward again to about 2008 I hadanother second incidentthat really opened my eyes to how aboutour government really is and what'sgoing onsitting at a traffic light I was veryended at about fifty miles an hourme and the driver seat driver seat brokefrom the frame ended up in the backthis guy was illegal alien non-englishspeaking never driver's license ofcourse drunk and in a stolen car andwhat they did with him was they just lethim go no consequences whatsoeverthe insurance company said I could tryto recoup some cost by suing him if Icould find him but that way it would beimpossible so that really opened my eyesto the corruption that's going on notjust that they FBI federal level but atlocal levels as well like I said thatwas an illegal alien drunk in a stolencar and just rear-ended me I'll stoptrapped like doing nothing just standingstill and they just let him go so fromthen I knew there's something seriouslyseriously wrong and I really startedpaying more attention to what thepoliticians were sayingrealize they were all lying and whenTrump came along I did switch toRepublicans just because he couldn't bebought out he wasn't one of the crook'dRepublicans or Democrats so I did votefor him when Hillary came along I triedto convince my friends what she was likebeing from Louisiana we all knowhorrible Hillary and what she's doneso there was no way I was fighting forit and I tried to show them how she wascheating in the primaries at the timeand they really wouldn't believe me Ihope they do now I don't know if they'regood friends they were total they'reBulls walking to marches and everythingelse I'm lucky to still have thosefriends they're wonderful people and Irespect their passion and they're notviolent so and they're they're goodpeople but I cannot talk to them aboutanything I believe as far as politicsI'll probably lose them instantlybut that was my walkway was when Trumpstarted walking into the office I walkedaway from the Democrats and now with allthe hate that I see from the Democratsall that hate I will never vote Democratagain for any Democrat I will never voteDemocrats began ever because of the hateit doesn't belong here[Music]

hi so I'm making this video for the thewalk away campaign and I used to be aliberal I voted for Obama back in 2008 Iwas in college I didn't really know anybetter and I'm a minorityum I know I don't always look like itpeople usually assume that I'm white butI am actually a first-generationAmerican I'm Hispanic I learned Spanishsimultaneously while I learned Englishmy parents are from Argentina myfather's Raja Tina and my mom's fromEcuadorand I have become very outspoken as ofthis last year for conservative politicsthe reason being because after a lifelong experience of being liberal Irealized that it hasn't helped I'm fromNew Jersey as you can probably see by myshirt I have a lot of New Jersey pridebut I noticed that we've had Democratsin control of our state for in my entirelife almost and nothing has gottenbetter they keep promising that they'regonna give us some more money to solveour issues but that never fixes anythingthe schools that were bad when I was alittle kid are still bad now30-something years later I'm also amilitary vet and I was insert in activeduty service when Obama was presidentand I saw how bad the military was beingrun I saw the low morale I do not likeanything that has happened from theDemocrat Party and so I realized thateven though speaking out forconservative values is controversialit's the right thing to do we have themore intelligent ideas but it's not it'snot always emotionally appealing on thesurface and that's why it's so hard tospeak about these things but I'll giveyou an example so we recently had thethe Supreme Court decision about theChristian cake baker who decided to denya wedding cake for a for a gay coupleand I remember as soon as the incidentfirst happened there was a New Jerseylesbian couple that owns a teachershop and they went on the news and theysaid they support this Christian Bakernot because they support discriminationbased on a person but they do just theydo support the right of a product ownera store owner to say what a person canand cannot do with their product so theysaid for example if somebody came intoour store and wanted to have a t-shirtprinted out for some kind of anti LGBTQrally they would like to have the rightto say no but on the surface it's toughto understand why that's such animportant right the leftist want us tobelieve that this is all about antiLGBTQ or that everything that'sconservative it conservative is racismbut I'm a testament against that like Isaid I'm Hispanic but I support Trump Isupport all of his policies I love theway the country has been turning aroundin this past year so once upon a time Iwas a liberal too and I love thismovement I hope it grows and we needmore people that are diverse to speakout I myself have actually also createda Facebook page as well because I want Iwant our voices to be magnified so thatpeople know it's not a taboo to supportconservative values[Music]hi so I'm making this video for the thewalk away campaign and I

hey Brandon this is my I'm not a Russianbot video as you requestedcongratulations on this movementI've watched a couple of interviews onTV you're doing outstanding job ofcourse none of it would be possiblewithout the people brave enough to stepup and post their testimonies as to whythey walked away I know with you it wasfrom the Democrat Party but I've seenposts on here that people are justhaving a political awakening and thatour political system is is brokenI do see posts from older folks likemyself who some of walked away recentlyothers like myself have walked away manymany years ago my walk away moment cameback after I was discharged from theMarine Corps I was registered Democratmy parents were Democrats so Iregistered a Democrat I got my degreeand along came the 1992 election cycleand during the 91 year Ross Perot cameonto the scene and I was I was attractedto his point of view and I oftenwondered what a what government wouldlook like it was a more and more like abusiness in that and not like theantiquated system that we have right nowand so I left the Democrat Party becamean independent voter never wentRepublican but the mechanism what reallytriggered me to leave the Democrat Partyand I haven't really quite heard it hereand it was testimonyis the party's structure itself whichwas in full display during the 2016election with in the primaries withBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton whereBernie Sanders super-delegates can stepin and hand so many votes over toHillary Clinton and this super-delegatessystems will call my attention back inthe early nineties which wasn't easy toget that information I had to read booksabout the formation of the party aboutthe Democratic Party it's not like theInternet today the internet back thenwas in infancy stage there were no cellphones iPads surface tablets and allthat garbage I mean I had little humantoll library and checked out books butthat was my political awakening Idecided to look within and see what ifmy core values aligned with the Democratvalues or if they aligned with theRepublican values although I grew upreligious I didn't see myself aligningwith the Republicans much beyond thefact that they appeared to be morefiscally conservative appeared was thekey word there so I remain anindependent and to this day I'm still anindependent but I always had an opinionthat the parties were out for themselvesand that the political leanings werereally just using ideological views todivide America into Democrats andRepublicans and that they would use thisto keep their power base and I knew thattime would be would be the determiningfactor if my my opinion was correct andnow that I'm 52 years old and haven'tgone through the election of BarackObama and the Democrats having fullcontrol and the election of Donald Trumpwith Republicans have full control myopinions are validated back in 2008 likemany of you who've walked away you hadan opportunity with the Democrat Partyto check off every left wing Democratagenda items from Union legislationimmigrant nation gay rights anti conjust check it all off all but they didnothingthey did nothing what they did was theyline the pockets of corporationshealthcare corporations with taxpayerdollars is what they did they doanything to Wall Street so theRepublicans you know came in in 2010 andgot the checks and balances back inplace and they did nothing with it in2016 they have full control and DonaldTrump is fighting who the Republicans sowe have a system is broken it's beenbroken for many many decades broken fromour perspective worked perfectly finefrom the political elites perspectiveand every day that Donald Trump ispresident the United States you can seethey're coming apart and the fact thatthe media is now all in I mean it's youhave to be completely stupid or severelyindoctrinated and I have an opinionabout indoctrination I mean my kids aregoing through it in school right now andit's just it's amazing to me what whatpasses education it's more of anindoctrination systems what we got nowmy my youngest daughter was in fifthgrade she came home with a Bill ofRights hand out sheet that said that theSecond Amendment was the right to huntso anyway I try to raise my kids Isuggest that you do the same with yourkids is to become thinkers free thinkersthink of themselves apparently right nowthat's not the case apparently kids arebeing indoctrinated they have knee-jerkreactions to key buzzwords whether it'sgay administration or I'm sorry whetherit's gay rights or if it's illegalimmigration illegal illegal immigrantsmigrant workers all there is a heavyindoctrination process that's been goingon for probably better parties probablystarted back when I was in school butfrom where I came from to what I see nowin my my kids high school probably last25 years I'm guessingand of course many people manywell-educated people and there's adifference between being well-educatedand indoctrinated big difference andwhen you take these well-educated peopleand you start to discuss politicalideological topics with them and theysuddenly start quoting bumper stickerslogans or they they read a headline offthe New York Times or they just checkoff the talking points that's beenreleased by the DNC yet sit there inwonder and say so you've got a Harvarddegree you've gotta yell degree you wentto Dartmouth what really they not thinkfor themself and it's sort of likePavlov's dog it's a reaction it's likethis is where they've been conditionedand they don't even know it so I have alittle bit of a test for those of youthat may be viewing videos here onBrandon's group here about whether ornot you're having an awakening period orwhether those little seeds of questionsin your head are valid and I say this Itell this all of my left-wing buddiesthat if they want to check what thelevel of indoctrination is very simplemy formula is this your level ofindoctrination is inversely proportionalto the depth of your argument meaning ifyour argument doesn't extend past abumper sticker slogan you're heavilyindoctrinated if your argument goes fromthe bumper sticker slogan to you ofwhite privilege or you are an idiot orsome other derogatory name that I won'tuse in this video well then you areseverely indoctrinated you have nowcrossed the line into what I call theuseful idiot you don't know that termits origins are

TrumpI thought Trump was put in there for thesole purpose of losing and the way I sawit was I was always I mean that was aDemocrat before but I wasn't afraid tocriticize Obama you know and I did andevery time I criticized Obama for offeranything that seemed to me to be commonsense I'd be called the races that wassimply because it's black is like yo Ivoted for the guy I wanted him to winhe's better than McCain and the otherwho was who D go against Kerry come onit was obvious Obama okay to meat the time and plus I was a unionworker you know what and the union'salways told us vote Democrat voteDemocrat the the political parties theDemocrats have the union vote lockeddown or at least they didn't nowadays Isee a lot of Union guys they may putmoney into the Union who gives theirmoney to the Democrats but when it comestime to votethey vote Republican okay so um what Ifound was um I was always democratic Iused to get mad at Trump you know I gotmad at him over the Paris Accord nowwhat happened for me was that um Idecided on Facebook I I've always been afacebook troll just getting peopleworked up and what I did was that Iwould um I decide I used to roleplay abit you know pretend I'm someone elseand I have done it before I'll probablydo it againbut nowadays I pretty much am Who I amand I say Who I am but um I was doingthe role play thing and I said I'm gonnaplay a trump supporter because I wouldsee just the sheer mention of Trump'sname would get people on it is e theyget not single bunker sounds like oh youget that mad about truth well then I'mgoing to be a trump supporter and alsowhat was happening was that um everytime I was on Facebook bashing Trumpsome old confront me and I realized Ireally didn't have much of an argumentagainst Trump I was just kind of like Iwasn't paying attention to politics Iwould just fall back in emotions youknow and be like I just don't like himhe's a jerk well are you gonna arguewith that I mean if someone says theydon't like him you

what's going on everybody so i'm out atthe pooluh watching my son swim aroundand i think he'd think he's a fish but idigressbut anyway i wanted to make this videojust to tella quick i guess summary whyi make the bold statement to say thatthe democratic party hate black peopleand this is something that it took awhile for me to realize a while for meto understandit took a little bit to chew on kind oflike a piece of steakit take steak is very difficult to chewand digestbut it was a piece of steak for me tochew and digest the fact thatthe democratic party historically ha hahas hated black people nownowadays people will argue that thedemocratic party hates america and hateseverybodyand i would concur with that argumentbutwhen you look at history and you look atthe peoplethat are being used abused andtricked and conned into supporting thedemocratic partyi have to say the race that's gettingthe raw end of the dealis black people and the reason i saythat is becausefor years and years and years peoplehave told usthat we should vote democrat that therepublicans are racistthat the republicans don't care aboutblack people that the republicans aresomehowanti-african-american agendaafrican-american expansion prosperityand it has all been a lie it'sunfortunatebecause a lot of us believe it blindlyyou know i consider myself apassive-aggressive democrati voted for barack obama his second termif you would have asked me was idemocrat or republican my whole life i'dhave said a democratand to be honest until now i don't evenknow why i would even say i was ademocrati didn't even know the differencebetween a democrat and a republicanpartyif you would ask me what a conservativewas i wouldn't have knownthis is the honest to god true and sothe the democrats in my honest opinionbased on my researchvery impartial research i believe thatdemocrats have historically hated blackpeopleand i think they still hate black peopletoday now this is why i say thisit's not baseless and it's not me comingup with something to make you feel goodi'm just telling the truth and if youdisagree with me you could literally golook this stuff up for yourself and factcheck mefirst and foremost i'm gonna start withthe klu klux klani grew up believing that the klu kluxklan was probably republicansbecause the republicans are racist rightthe kuka's clandefinitely murdered slaughteredintimidatedand damaged the lives of so many blackpeoplewho created the democratic party whofounded the democratic party i mean ademocratic party but the kuga's clanthe democratic party you know that wasastonishing to me i could not believe itand then when you talk about the ideasin the pursuit of the democratic partyeven way back thenthey were the white supremacists theywere the ones that wanted whitenationalistsor white nationalism they are the onesthat did not want black people to votethey literally promoted and voted infavorof anti-laws and legislationthat will give black people the benefitto vote and become equal citizens anddesegregate from schoolsnot one person can deny that those arefactsyou may not like them you may be eatingsteak right nowand it's going to take a little bit todigest but those are factsthen you go to bill clinton and you talkaboutthe war on drugs now i'm all forpromoting laws and being a law-abidingcitizenbut they created a war on drugsthat affected black people and put moreblack people behind barsand separated them from their familieslike like no other legislation no otherprogram ever in historythat to me is is a direct attack againstafrican-americanpeople in the black community go look ituplet's let's keep moving to morecontemporary history i mean we couldlook at barack obamawhat did he do for black people nothinghe did nothingwe could look at the the rhetoric that'spushed aboutanti-police rhetoric that was promotedby barack obamawhat did that do for the black communitynothingsee they're not trying to tell youngbrothers to follow the lawthey're not trying to tell youngbrothers how to do how to best behavethemselvesand put themselves at a at a properposition when dealing with lawenforcement which could avoid 95 to 98of them getting killed they don't tellyou to sign up for the police departmentand monitor your own communitiesthey're not telling you that they'retelling you to resist which then makesyou more volatile towards policewhich then caused more interactions amore negative interaction with policethe residual effect of what barack obamadid as wellin related to relation to police madematters worsenot only for police not only for blackpolice officersbut for police officers in general andwhat do you see happenwhen you ridicule and you and youdemonize policewill they stop patrolling communitieswhere they're gonna get firedfor just looking at somebody wrongthey're not gonna get they're gonna getfiredif they make a legal arrest and somebodyjust decide to resist arrestso they quit patrolling the communitiesand what do you do the crime rate spikeswhat did barack obama do for chicagonothing i i don't know any legislation idon't know any crime nobody was sittingout there crying aboutthe separation of young people fromtheir families in chicagowhether they get murdered or sent toprison or they high on drugsnobody's crying about their childrenbeing separated from them nobody'strying totell drug dealers to get out of get outof jail free or get out of jail earlyso they can be reunited with theirfamily committing felony crimesjust like people crossing the border idon't hear them talking about that theydid nothingthen you moved to we could talk abouteven right nowwhat are the democrats doing they'repicking illegal immigrants over blackpeopleagain they don't

ii converted from a liberal to aconservative hereis my walk away story and i just want togive you a little background aboutmyselfmy entire family is very left-leaningi've pretty much been a democratfor most of my life i voted for barackobamain 2008 and 2012and going back to when i was in highschool and when i was in collegebeing a liberal being a democrat thenmeant something verydifferent than it means now at the timedemocrats liberals uh believed in freelovebelieved where they were just kind offun-loving hippies they believed inlegalization of marijuana and this was aplatform thati felt that i identified withconservatives believedthey're more on they're more religiousthey didn't believe in having sex tellmarriageuh they believed on trying to intensifythe waging war on drugs these were allthings that i wasn't fori like to smoke weed i like to havecasual sex i like to have funit seemed like all of the things thatconservativesuh were against were all the things thatwere funso i felt that i didn't really identifywithconservatives i was much more in tunewith the platforms with the ideologiesof the democratic partyand fast forward to 2020and it is completely different nowthe party that used to be so-called theparty of sciencewhich are the liberals right becauseeven back i remember back in the timeuh conservatives there was thismovement where they wanted to startteaching creationism in schoolwhich i thought was pretty crazy thiskind of goes againstum the scientific explanations of howthe world formed well todayconservatives are now the party ofscience liberals nowwant to teach that there are 50different genders in schooland if you say that a biological man hasa penis and a biological womanhas a vagina liberalswill lash out at you they are no longerthe party of science it's a complete180. and you see articles like this yousee articles in cnn nowwhere they are saying individuals withcervixes you know what another word foran individual with a cervix isit's a woman it's a womanliberals can't seem to have a grasp onscience nowand then also look at this you can't fatshame someone you can't talk aboutsomeone's health someone's body weightas it relates to their healthwithout fat shaming them this is anotherconcept that iscounter to science just talking aboutsomeone's health asit relates to their weight as it relatestohealthy dieting and eating and exercisesomething else that's another thing thatis not reallyin line with being able to openly andfreely expressthe science of health nutritiondiet and exercise and theni mean this isn't even the worst part ofliberalism identity politics i think arevery toxic but the mosttoxic part of today'sliberalism is that they are soanti-trumpthat they have become pro-crime and imean i would think that thiswould be the turning point for anyone itshould be if you like to be in asafe society if you like your taxdollars to go towardsprotecting our communities if you likethe peace of mindof being able to go to bed at nightwithout fearing thatsomeone's gonna come smashing throughyour window and tear you out of your bedand beat the [ __ ] out of you and takeall of your belongings and burn yourhouse downthen you can't be a liberal you justcan't bethey have him they have embraced andemboldenedthe worst most violent peoplethat our country has ever seen and imeanit would be one thing if it was just oneor two of them butby far and large their party was againstthe mass violence and the anarchy that'shappening all over the countrybut i mean you go down the list and youlook at a lot of these mayors ofmajor cities atlanta seattleminneapolis new york city los angeles imean the list goes onwhere you've had mayors that arestanding and embracingand emboldening these people that aretrying to destroy our country thesepeople that are trying to terrorizeneighborhoods if you're a law abidingcitizeni just don't understand how you can be aliberalwhen you have liberals that areemboldening criminalslike what happened to uh the mccloskeyswhere you had these so-called protestersthat broke through a gatemarched onto their front lawn and thenthey usetheir second amendment to defendthemselvesand then legal action was taken againstthem i mean that's a very scary thing oryou see what happened inseattle where you have mayor jennydurkinletting people take over six squareblocks of an areaand terrorize all the citizens terrorizeall the business ownersand she calls it the summer of love aspeople are dying as business ownersor being asked for moneyjust so they can continue to operateit's terrorismand nothing was even being done about itup until these criminals up until theseprotesters if you want to call them thatmarch to her houseit just shows the complete disdain thatthey have for their own citizensso i just don't understand how intoday'sday and age when you have so manydemocratsall the way at the top you have aoc thatis saying that she supports deep on thepolice you haveum rashida talib also saying that shesupports defund the police i mean it isthe scariestmovement ever the democrats have becomeso anti-trump that they have becomepro-crime they have become anti-policeand given their new partyideologies i just don't seehow anyone who is a law abidingcitizen who has a reasonablelogically thinking head on theirshoulderscan vote democrat anyway that is my walkawaystory hope you like my video leave yourthoughts in the comments belowsubscribe and i will see you all nexttime

hi I'm Cece and this is my walk withmoment I am a GDIgosh-darn independent I have always beenone who will vote my conscience and Ilisten to the candidates on both sidesthere's not one side or the other thatI'm going to say is the absolute sidethat I will vote for let's look ticketsmany times when I voted that I have tosay that in the last few years I've beenunable to vote for the DemocratsI actually was giving Barack Obama anopportunity and I considered voting forhim until the day he threw Reverendwhite under the bus that was my walkaway never again moment because the nextperson they put over the next thinghappened was they what they did toBernie Sanders not that I was going tovote for Bernie Sanders but just theprocess of how he got knocked out forHillary to be their candidate and themedia behind her the media attacks onDonald Trump where Donald Trump was upoh my god everybody falling over DonaldTrump wanting to have their picture withDonald Trump thought he was the greatestthing until he declared he was runningfor president that was always kind of amoment for me why are they doing that mydegree is in photojournalism and I knowthat the way that journalism has gonetodaymy school adviser my my communicationarts adviser dr. Stewart Leon is turningover in his grave at the lack of ethicsbut these people are now using topurport that they're reporting the newsbecause they're not reporting the newsthe ethics is supposed to be that you dothe who why where when and how withoutany slant of a bias you're supposed tojust report the factsthat's all and sometimes having been aninvestigative reporter it is difficulton how to do that but there are ways toexpose things in the way of journalismand investigative journalism such thatyou expose people who need to be exposedbut you do it without bias you do itwithout slanting your story such thatwhoever's weaving it could be persuadedone way or the other and the more andmore of the mainstream media has justgone so far away from anything that'sjournalistic even Fox News is not reallygreat journalism and they all constantlyrepeat the same things the same verbiagethe same narrative and that's anotherthing that really bothers me that nobodyhas an independent voice if it's amanufactured crisisit's a manufactured crisis here is amanufactured crisis they're the sameverbiage over it like there is somebodywho is writing a script for him it'smore like script than it is news andthat really has bothered me over thelast few years but there is no news it'sall opinions and it has been so divisiveand so the toilet and I really wish thatthere was a way that we could changethat I don't know that there will but Ido feel that maybe the walkaway peoplewho are going to start walking withpeople who have independent thoughts andcan wake up and consciously think aboutthings see things from more than oneperspective and I stand up on yourcoffee table look down at the floor itlooks different than when you standingon your own two feet on the floor andI'm one of those people who I amhonoring every person stranger family orfriend equally and if you haven't adifferent perspective because you are anindividual you are capable ofindependent thought you're capable of anindependentaffective come to me let's talk aboutyour perspective will compareperspectives there may be be even achance that they you could win me overto your perspective but the problem withso much of the left is the Democratstoday is there's no opportunity fordiscussion it's all name-calling it'sall hate speech and violence it breaksdown to that and I've had peoplediffering me and not want to haveanything to do with me because I am verymuch a gosh-darn independent I say whatI mean and mean what I say so I'm goingto congratulate all of you for waking upand walking away and I'm glad to walkwith any of you and any time just lockarms let's wake the rest of the world up[Music]
