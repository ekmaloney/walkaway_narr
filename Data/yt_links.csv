I hate being on camera and public speaking. It was Brandon’s call for videos, along with all of y’all inspiring stories and the courage and bravery you’ve shown, that gave me the courage to try to make a video. That and I’m one of y’alls moderators and I, especially, should have had one up LOL In my story I talk about the moments that eventually really start making me look at the Democratic Party-my experience with welfare benefits, but I neglected to make it clear that it was the research into that— how the Democratic Party encourages single motherhood and dependency on the welfare state and being a victim because of your identity, that really opened my eyes. I’m sorry I’m such a rambler. This movement has given me so much hope and faith for the future. I don’t know if I ever would have had the courage to tell people that I voted for Trump or moved away from the Democratic Party if it wasn’t for all you guys!!! #WalkAway​. To a united America—where we can have actual discourse and discussion and try to find compromise or at least respectfully agree to disagree. Also, no worries, I did not name my ex, not fully, I left out his last name on purpose. Lol Edit:I’ve gotten a few personal messages and a couple comments on the thread. Yes, I am a mom of 5. I know I have a recent cover pic with all of us in it on my FB page if you need to verify that. My kids range in age: oldest is 21, then 16, 9, 8 and 4. I was really hesitant to do my WalkAway story because it involved welfare and I know it can be a touchy subject for some. There are genuine people who need it. I also know it’s being used to encourage people to stay on it and even abuse it....and it was because of the latter that I felt I needed to share my story. I don’t judge those who are on it and need it. That’s what it is there for My family used it for a couple of months. I just wanted to point out some of the problems within it."" Kristal
