103120159374,"I wouldn’t say I ever walked away, rather, I walked TOWARD the Conservative party. Ever since I was old enough to vote, I never actually took the initiative to vote because in my mind I thought that ALL politicians are liars and they never actually mean what they say. That all changed after I seen the liberals’ reaction to Donald Trump winning against Clinton. People started burning flags, running in the middle of busy freeways and destroying public property all in the name of a “protest”. Granted, I didn’t vote for Trump or Clinton for that matter but I had enough sense to know that the liberal majority’s response to Trumps victory wasn’t making America better but worst which I knew was in complete contradiction to the idea of voting. So I got on my Facebook page and I was very neutral because once again, I was ignorant to the political game but I said something like “if u don’t like Donald Trump that’s okay but he won fair and square and burning buildings and burning flags isn’t going to change anything.” Once I posted that I got a bunch of hate mail from my friends that were apparently liberals saying I was a racist, bigot and so on and cussing me out. It just to me made the liberals seem more ignorant than I originally thought they were because instead of talking to me like educated people they wanted to cuss me out while calling me every name on the book. It was after this, I did my OWN research regarding BOTH parties because as a CHRISTIAN man if I was going to enter the political arena I was going to back the one that stands for righteousness. After doing my research, I found that the democrats are not only ignorant but also fatal to America. Now, I try to reason with those believing the lies of the demo rating party and I have even written CHRISTIAN hip hop music to express the dangers of the lies of the democrats. Thank you for anybody who took the time to read this. GOD BLESS EVERYBODY #prayingforthecountryilove"
102832483103,"My sister invited me to join because she knew I was feeling defeated seeing all of the insanity going on in our country. I have always been conservative. I have always voted republican and finally began voting straight ticket about 20 years ago when I realized there would never be a democrat that would ever align with my beliefs. I grew up in a predominately black town so always had black friends. We spent the night with each other. And this was in the 70’s when it wasn’t the “woke” thing to do. I was just raised by amazing Christian parents who simply loved everyone. As an adult I have always treated everyone with respect and never looked at skin color. I volunteer with a homeless ministry - and we equally serve everyone. I sponsor 4 children in Holeta, Ethiopia. I have clients of all races and treat everyone equally. I have black family members. I have never said or acted in any way that could be construed as racist. However apparently I am a racist! Who knew?? I remember the first time I was called a racist. I was 47 years old and a “friend” in the animal rescue community, actually the person that I first fostered dogs for, blatantly called me a racist because I didn’t like Obama. I was stunned and heart broken. This friend literally said the most vile, hateful and heart-wrenching things to me simply because I thought he was a horrible president and leader with detrimental policies. Why, when someone is black, has it become taboo to disagree with them? Why is it perfectly acceptable to call every single white person racist and privileged? Why have we come to a place where racism is perfectly ok as long as it is directed against white people? How have we come to a point where it is believed only white people are capable of racism? Where has our country gone? I am so thankful to see there are so many people waking up and walking away from the insanity. You all give me hope. I am still concerned Biden will win this election - it is actually a bit terrifying how close we are to the collapse of our great nation. I actually was not a Trump fan, in fact I didn’t like him much at all. But I voted for him in 2016 because the other choice was unthinkable. However I have been pleasantly suprised. He has made me eat my words. He has turned out to be a great leader, even amidst the evil directed at him from the left. I may have voted for him with trepidation the first time but I will skip to the voting booth to vote for him this time. But...we can all expect the left to explode in fury when that happens. But it must happen if we hope to preserve our nation. I have grandchildren depending on us to save and secure their future. Thanks again for the encouragement I receive from reading your stories. We must keep speaking truth because apparently you all are proof some people are willing to listen."
103093650132,"I Consider myself moderate by definition and unpolitical, it’s not a high priority to me but there are too many acts of terrorism being done by Democratic Party and I have a duty to stand against terrorism and support the police and president in restoring our country. The alternative is to support chaos and mob rule. When I heard that ppl tore down the Columbus statue I was upset because it means something to this country. I try to imagine what America would look like if they torched Lady Liberty 🗽 and I can’t imagine it. It’s such a part of this country. Many ppl are upset and they help to build this country. There’s a lot of things I don’t support and that’s why I walk away from Democrat and lean right. Enough is enough. I’m Voting for Trump."
102515465350,"I not a writer but her it goes. I grew up in a small town in southern Missouri to two parents that worked hard to raise 2 kids. We didn't have much ,but had everything we needed . My grandmother was a die hard Democrats that raised a family during the depression and wouldn't have voted for a Republican if it would save her life. My dad was the same way. I myself always voted for the candidate instead of the party so sometimes I disagree with my dad. I voted for Obama the first round as I wasn't happy with Bush and I believed hope and change. In about his third year I realized he was a fraud and wasn't changing anything or give any hope. When he won a second term as I Seen it he put into play the total destruction of our health care system and the way employers hire worker because health care skyrocketed which employers respond by working people part with no benefits and it's only got worse ever since. I've set here the last 5 years through the democratic process they have implemented to destroy America to gain the power back at any cost. It is total disgusting to watch them and the media ( Facebook , Twitter, and all the news and news papers) doing everything to get Trump out at ALL COST to the American people. Now I will address BLM Thing .I don't believe in blm because all American lives matter from the homeless, drug addicts, veterans, aborted children everyone. There are people of every nationality kill by people of all nationalities every day in this country and no one life is above the other,every life is important. Democrats are fueling the destruction to gain the upper hand against Trump at any cost to America. I've never felt like I was ever better than a black person as I just never was around many to understand them. Slavery was wrong and their are many injustices that happen is this word to alot of people. I've seen racism in people of all nationalities not just whites and I would be will to bet the 100% have shown racism towards someone even though they try hard not to and know it's wrong .we all have sin and come short of the glory of God and that's why we have forgiveness. I hate what's going on in this country to the point that I feel hopeless to change anything, I'm angry and disgusted that i want to WALKAWAY from everything. My soul hurts for America like it's my hope dying. If we don't come together as Americans !!! Not black Americans !!! Not white Americans but as Americans this country is doomed. I've rambled on enough and I hope it makes sense to everyone. If I've offered anyone it's not my intention. Please can we heal this country."
102044835678,"My WalkAway story is a bit different... I was always a non-voter with no favorite party. I was bitter toward Lyndon Johnson after I returned from Vietnam. I disliked him and all politicians equally. I had no desire to get involved with the political process. Election after election, I sat back and watched, not really caring who became president. But in the back of my mind, I couldn't help but notice that life in America seemed to degrade when a democrat was in office, and then rejuvenate when a Republican was sworn in. I still refrained from registering to vote. I began to get a sense of involvement in 1992 when Bill Clinton was elected. For the first time since LBJ, I actually despised the president. I nearly registered to vote but didn't. Emotions began to churn inside me when Obama was elected. For eight years I watched as he practically destroyed America. I began reading history books and doing research on the democratic party. I was appalled when I learned that they had created the Ku Klux Klan for the singular purpose of preventing black voters from voting for Grant. I began despising the Democratic party, but not enough to compel me to register to vote. It wasn't until Hillary Clinton announced her bid for the White House that I made the decision. Not only did I register to vote, I declared myself a Republican. I would do anything to keep that traitor out of the Presidents chair. I began watching the debates with earnest. I wasn't a big Trump supporter at this time, but just wanted to get the best Republican to beat Hillary. When all the primaries were completed, and Donald Trump became the candidate, I threw in my support. I had no idea how he would to as president, but I knew we would be better off with him than with Clinton. It didn't take long after the inauguration for me to see what a great leader he is for our country. He now has my unwavering support, and I am a republican for life. Trump 2020"
101958656715,"I am proud of myself for joining this group. I also feel like I peed on the Pope and the whole world witnessed it. 🤣 I am a registered Democrat, but it doesn't feel like the same party it was when I signed up. I want social justice, but I also know that rioting and destroying property isn't the way to do it. And I also fully support law enforcement. I am tired of people treating others badly. I feel like some people in my own party shut me down or shut me out when I try to see things from a different perspective. My boyfriend teaches me a lot and shows me the side of the Republican party that I haven't seen, which is that it is willing to listen to what others have to say. And it has a heart too, and that matters a lot to me. I want to do what I thought the Democratic party was about and believe that most people want to do good and be part of something good. I am glad that I am realizing that the Republican party wants that too."
101860222988,"I’ve typed and deleted this 100 times. Trying to decide if I wanted to share my story or not. So, here it is. I apologize if I’m rambling lol. I’ve spent the majority of my life avoiding politics. I registered to vote when I was 18 (1999) but didn’t vote until Obama’s first run. I wanted change. I believed in his slogan. Obama would bring us all together! We were poor growing up. The same as our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents. We were told by educators that it was a waste of their time to even try to teach us. We would never amount to anything. Education was geared towards the kids that had come from affluent families. Not the kids that had come from broken homes, from the wrong side of the tracks. Especially not the ones raised in a same sex home. Society made sure I knew how unimportant I would be. I had no interest in a system that had no interest in me. I became angry, bitter and sad. I could have easily slipped through the cracks... but I refused. My grandfather and father had fought for this country. I’d be damned if I wasn’t going to fight for my place in it. I made the decision to make a better life for myself, and eventually my children. I made it. I built that life. I wanted nothing more than to build a better America for people like myself. The abused, neglected, poor, uneducated, hopeless ones! Because this is truly the land of opportunity if you’re willing to work for it! That promised change never came though. Instead of building together, we were shattered as a nation. The fragments divided by class, by race, by religion. Let down yet again. Politicians are liars. They tell people what they want to hear, while hiding their real agendas behind pretty words and empty promises. I’d never vote again... Until Donald Trump, much to my surprise. I saw a man (not a perfect man) that loves this country and would do what it takes to make it great. He’s certainly not a politician. Pretty words are definitely not his specialty but the hard truth is. This man has taken more criticism and ridicule than any other president but he continues to try to do what’s best for the United States. He’s my president and I am proud to vote for him again. Trump 2020."
101731996743,"Thank you for accepting me to this group. I love all of the positivity and everyone’s stories of them waking! I don’t have a great story as some of you do. I’m ashamed that I used to vote democrat and thought that was the only way to vote. I wasn’t raised in a political or conservative family. Actually politics weren’t really discussed in my family. I did vote for Obama for his first term. 😢 it was then I woke up and started seeing the corruption and divide that was happening. I did not like to talk politics to anyone, I did not want any confrontation. That is not me anymore! I’m proud to vote replubican and love President Donald Trump! He is trying so hard for our country and has done great despite constantly trying to be knocked down time and time again!"
101545614907,"Before Trump Vs. Hillary, I was never into politics. I felt like my vote didn't matter and politics were a pay and play game that I just wasn't going to get invested in. When I heard Trump was running for President I thought it was a big joke. A publicity stunt. Then as I began to investigate the awful things I heard about Hillary Clinton, I was forced withen myself to take a look at both of them. The more I learned about both of them, the more I realized what a truly compassionate man Trump was. I also learned what a truly evil woman Hillary was. I am a mother to 5 beautiful children and grandmother to 8 amazing grandbabies and counting. I realized I had to become invested after really looking into both Trump and Clinton. It was the fact that if Hillary became President, I would see pure evil in charge of the future for my children and grandchildren. I couldn't sit and stomach the thought of such corruption continuing to plague America. So I became invested and outspoken for Trump. I thank God he became President! Now, faced with Biden as our potential President, I am disgusted at the very thought. Biden has been in politics my whole life. Was vice President for 8 years and has done not one upstanding thing for our country. In fact, I am 100% sure that if Biden wins, within 6 months he will step down because he is not mentally capable to run this country. So, this is all a power grab for whomever he chooses as VP. His potential running mates are all disgusting woman just like Clinton. In my opinion, this is a fight of good vs. evil. The Democrats have become so far left and unhinged, they would rather destroy our country than heal it. Watching the lies they spew openly is just something I never thought politicians would do...yet they are. The divide the have created and fueled leaves me in fear for my children and grandchildren. Trump is a truly selfless man that loves Americans of all colors, races and religions. His track record proves it. Biden is a racist and disgusting pervert, his track record proves it. We haven't heard anything about the women that charged Biden with sexual assault anymore...swept under the rug. Just seeing how the Democrats get away with everything they accuse the Republicans of is proof enough that they will continue to get away with worse if given the chance. I am proud to say that my children all support our wonderful President Trump! I will forever be ""woke"" to the fact that we all need to be invested in voting and calling out the evil doings of all politicians and demand that they work for ""We the people"" instead of making hundreds of millions in office from dark bribes. Proud to be a staunch Republican! I now vote because my eyes have been opened wide to what will happen if we don't. God bless Trump! I hope Candace Owens will run for President in the future as well! We need to put trust back into our politics...and the only way to do that is to remove the career politicians, like Biden, that have done nothing but hurt America! #Trump2020 let's keep making America greater with a great leader!"
101195333937,"I feel blessed to be among this group of Americans. It is encouraging to see so many show their love and support for this country. So my story is not too far from most here... I grew up in a democratic liberal house. My mother is 2nd generation Italian and my father is first generation Mulism Iranian. My dad moved here before the Revolution and has become an American citizen. He has remarried and Iranian who has also become an American citizen. I never really followed politics too closely until watching Obama. Little by little I watched and read more. Even though trying to watch ""real news"" I was seeing more and more hypocrisies. I voted for Trump as he was the ""anti politician"" after these past years I went from a Trump voter to a Trump supporter. America is amazing but not perfect, only God is. So since we are only human we need to stand together. I pray that some eyes are opened and not fall into the leftist trap. Pro USA Pro constitution Pro freedom Pro police Pro life( all life ) Pro Trump"
101153783224,Hi.i havent posted my story but after reading so many here I thought I would say you all made me cry and laugh and I felt like I found a place that I can feel good in. I grew up in a democratic family. My dad couldn't read so he would take me along with the excuse he was teaching me early. I would whisper to him the names. Nobody knew that we did that.After my dad past away my mom got real involved in taking part in registering voters but I never understood the process of voting. I also never voted until Trump ran for president. The only thing I knew about Obama was he was the first black president. After watching him and his family tell the world that t hey lived in a house built by slaves. It seemed that they pushed the issue of how horrible white people were. I had spent those eight years of watching reading and learning. I had already spent time reading about the Trump family so when he said he was running for office I got excited for the first time. I voted for Trump and still wanted to know more. I eventually met a lady who had driven the presidential family during the election and she had pictures her husband and she attended all the events and the inaugural ball. I was fascinated. She said they are the most caring and sweet family. I am now a cheerleader for Trump. I am happy to find a place that I can talk Trump and not be attacked. Thank you!!
100953773760,"I just want to say thank you for the adding me to the group. Like, many others on the page I #WalkedAway, I have always voted and was registered Democrat. I mainly did it for my mom, who has been threatening me about my ruining life and my family's life due to my new political switch to the republican party. After all my research and homework that I did I realize my view was more conservative driven. Nothing that the democratic party stand on matches my views and it doesn't match the future I hope to have for my girls. I have had friends who out right stop taking to me and I have had family members telling me I am risking alienating my family if I continue down this path; being a conservative republican. I stand for God and church My family structure My freedom And many more. Trump 2020! Thank you guys again for add! I am truly greatful that I get to be around like minded individuals, that share similar views on the political spectrum. I don't want to get into too much detail."
100635510110,"I've been part of this group only a couple months after it began. I'm a Walkaway. I abstained from politics since Desert Storm, watched a lot of amazing footage from CNN at that time. When it ended, I spent my time doing other things away from politics. I was intrigued by the decision of Trump to run for President. Once it was confirmed, I started watching National/World News again. I started with CNN. It took me literally one hour to see right through the bull shit of Don Lemon and his snarky biased cold hearted group. I must say, I was somewhat in shock in how obvious it was. I searched for a new middle of the road channel and ended on Fox News. People spoke more from the heart and down to earth, with logic, much more my speed. I'll make this brief with some bullet points: Did a ton of research Realized I didn't know squat about the politics, perceptions and realities Discovered biases on Google using strategic searches Same biases with most social media and National News Never cared for Trump much before, but came to believe he made a huge sacrifice to fight for us on the right side of sanity and make America the place it should be including fairness for all Voted for Trump as a Democrat and promptly changed over to Republican without blinking Love what he has accomplished with Nation's economics, jobs, de-regulations and much much more, in spite of you know who Discovered recently what Marxism is really about, along with White Privilege and White Fragility. I read a great article regarding this type of control, it's called A Double Bind. Great read and better understanding of how to combat this behavior! BLM is a Marxist organization I denounce violence and destruction I enjoy Rush Limbaugh, ABL Anthony Brian Logan, Candace Owens, Many on the Fox Team, Brandon Tatum, and more Will be getting a Conceal and Carry shortly because good guys with guns hurt bad guys with guns I'm honored to be among all of you and willing to help in any way!!!

100574250756,"A quick share of my walk with story...I’ve always favored conservative views on maintaining our Constitution, honoring our Military, LEOs, and First responders, Free market capitalism, having a servant’s heart to those in need, and hard work. During Bush 2.0 though, I started noticing Republicans (in general) were not really aligned to those principles. It was becoming the party of greed and excess, of closed door deals that would eventually lead to China having a strangle hold around American assets... and it’s almost happened. Then came the Tea Party.... which seemed to ignite those who were seeing what I was, and knew what bho was before he took office. I didn’t need to see his birth certificates or the theories behind it, or to read all the headlines to see that this individual was and is a traitor. He is NWO personified and was planned long before he ran for the Presidency. Now comes Q, information on Flynn, on unmasking the President, his family and those who still stand with him... I voted for him in 2016 without hesitation, and I’ll be doing it again and bringing as many as I can to the right side along the way. My husband is as staunch in his conservative views as I am, however my Mom is very old school democrat... even though they assassinated that party in 63. She is a brilliant woman yet she was so drawn in by bho... and is willing to vote for Biden, as is my younger sister. I do bring up items going on in an attempt to help educate her... but I also have to draw the line and halt the convo because at some point each American will have to decide if we remain free or we become another Venezuela but for now, in her failing health... I chose my words and battles carefully. I love reading all your testimonies and many of you have endured so much to get here... just know I’ll be standing with you and feel very privileged to read your journeys. God bless and keep each of us, pull on your armor, because I feel it’s going to get very rough, even after the election. 🇺🇸"
100529375379,"Hey everyone. I am a lifelong Conservative, but really identify as a Libertarian rather than a Republican. I've voted R and L, but never D. In 2016, I was unsure about Trump, but knew I couldn't and wouldn't vote for Hillary. I ended up voting for a third party candidate, because I bought into the stories about Trump. Well, I have watched him keep his promises. I have watched him stand up to the lifelong politicians of the Right and Left. I have watched him stand up for US. I have listened to my left leaning friends tell me he is a racist, he's a rapist, he doesn't respect women. My own brother told me on election night that he was worried his gay friends would be locked away under Trump. At the time, I told him I didn't think there was much chance of that. Anyways, yes I still am Libertarian, but in 2020 there is no room for me to vote on party. This election, more than any before, is about saving our country. We must save her from those that wish to destroy her and rebuild her in their image of some communist utopia. We all know how that ends. Trump is rough around the edges, he's no polished politician. I think that is why I trust him though. They man says what he thinks. He doesn't speak politician. We all know where he stands on the issues. As the mother of two young sons, I definitely want to MAGA! As I read all these stories from those of you that are walking away from the Left, I am so encouraged. I am happy to see more diversity coming to the side that just loves our country and our freedom. I welcome you all. It doesn't matter if you're LGBTQ, or what color your skin is, what religion you are or aren't, what gender you are, who you prefer to sleep with (as long as it's consentual.) If you love America, and all she stands for, and want to keep our freedoms, then this is the place for you. No judgement, no hate. Respect and love!!! #WalkAway #WalkWith"
102184662917,"UPDATE: Since sharing this on my page some “friends” have blocked me which really puzzles me. I try to always be fair and post in facts. This post was no different. How any New Yorker doesn’t agree with this is or is offended is crazy to me. Anyway, wanna thank you all for the love and support. I’ve read every single comment. Thank you all. #Trump2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 I have previously posted my #walkaway testimony, however, I feel compelled to add more as I witness my beloved New York fall apart before my eyes. I live on Long Island, New York. Imagine how infuriating and frustrating that is. I'm a red girl living in a blue state. We have a Governor who is now a dictator. The NY assembly gave him sole authority until April 2021 to make decisions. He has implemented or amended 250 laws to date and imposed over 30 executive orders with no checks and balances. NYS is in fiscal distress yet Cuomo places blame on Trump each and every day for NYS's financial woes. NY Senator Pam Helming and Assemblyman Dave DiPietro tried passing legislation to repeal the power granted to Cuomo. The NYS assembly is democratic controlled and blocked that move to reconvene for such purposes. Every single one of these democrats should be voted out of office. One person holding sole authority is NOT how government works! Cuomo complained he didn't have enough ventilators or hospital beds during the Covid crisis. So what does Trump do? Sends 4000 ventilators, sends the US Comfort Ship, turns the Javit center into a field hospital and constructs a pop up hospital in Central Park. NYS asked and Trump delivered. Guess what? No patients arrived at these field hospitals or on this ship. Why doesn't the media cover this and why aren't they outraged!? To boot, we have DiBlasio as mayor of NYC. His wife was put in charge of implementing a mental health program in the City but nearly $1 billion dollars is unaccounted for. I know, you are as outraged as me BUT he got re-elected despite this. What!??? From day one, he has preached anti-police rhetoric. He places targets on the backs of our men and women in blue each and everyday. He did NOTHING during the riots or looting. In fact, he went on tv to say he wants the police to look different during this time. He did not want any police in riot gear (um..we are in a riot), he wanted them to stand down and wanted less police. Does any of this make sense to you? Nope, me neither. NYS implemented bail reform meaning anyone arrested and if the crime is not deemed violent the criminal is released on bail. Also, any witnesses contact information must be released to the defense team which puts witnesses in jeopardy. On Long Island, a teenager's identity was concealed through court order protective order. Due to the new law, his identity was given to the defense team of a MS-13 gang member who he was due to testify against on a murder he witnessed. Guess what happened? The MS-13 gang membered murdered him! Mayor DiBlasio loves the bail reform. Since most criminals have no reason to show up to court to be sentenced DiBlasio has an incentive program. They give Baseball tickets or movie tickets and will pay for their transportation to show up in court. Are you as outraged as me? They just voted and passed to defund the the police department by $1 billion dollars. City Hall has people camped out, living in tents, children living in these tents, violence has erupted each day and each night and there is no police presence. The City looks like war zone. It's unrecognizable. We are a family that backs the blue. My son just graduated college with a criminology degree and is on the waiting list for the NYPD. While proud, how could he take this job? They now want to pass a law that police have to carry their own insurance in case anyone sues them. I watched videos of protestors hitting, spitting and throwing things at the police during the ""peaceful""protests. A cop shoved a protestor away from him after she was shouting in his face relentlessly. Guess what the Mayor vowed? Yup, he vowed to bring that police officer to justice and charge him. They arrested that officer. Nothing was done to the protestors or looters. NYC could really use Mayor Giuliani back in office to clean this mess up! AOC made it her mission to fumble all attempts of Amazon moving their headquarters to Queens, NY. She organized protestors daily. Headquarters in Queens would have resulted in more jobs for New Yorkers and meant other businesses would have flourished due to the influx of said employees. More people would have used the local cleaners, restaurants, shops etc. It was a win for New York. AOC crushed that and people there love her for it. BLM protests have been held often and even had one march down my quiet surburban street. While they want to defund they police, it should be noted that those protestors were accompanied by a multitude of police cars. I stopped and thanked each one of them for their prescence.

As anarchists, marxists, and fascists from the psychotic left and their Democrat handlers along with the pathetic main stream media try to shame us for our American history...know the truth. They aren’t attacking our history they are attacking our families and desperately trying to manipulate us to reject our family and national history.... We were warned that the socialist left would imbed themselves in our nation to destroy us...well now instead of working in the shadows they are emboldened and defended by Democrats to attack us out in the open. Vote Republican this Nov and get rid of these pathetic marxists and fascists who serve the Democrat party. Men, Women of all races and creeds we must stand together as one.

I'm lucky to say I was never a Democrat. I'm a hard-core conservative right down to the bone. I've lost friends over the years, because we don't see eye to eye. (They're so tolerant, eh?) I'm all about being on the front lines and exposing this corrupt and evil liberal left-wing Democratic party. I'm Pro-God, Gun, Life and TRUMP and I'm never backing down. Who's with me?"
99405696154,"Registered Democrat in 1972. I had what was then a classical liberal education, perhaps the last generation to get one. Not an indoctrination, but a process that taught me the think critically and skeptically. It demands facts and evidence. My journey toward conservatism had begun. I was the only Southerner in my dorm that did not vote for Jimmy Carter. I listened, and he sounded weak on foreign policy and his economic policies were inflationary. Four years later we had double digit inflation, unemployment, interest rates, long lines at the gas pumps and daily humiliation at the hands of the mullahs in Iran. REAGAN SAVED THE NATION. The modern democrats care only about power, and will stop at nothing to get it. Their ideas are the same failed retreads, taxes taxes taxes, regulations, to which they have added cancel culture, tolerance of leftwing violence, division, toxic race baiting and corruption. I will NEVER vote for a democrat, EVER."
99105478532,"I found this group yesterday and joined immediately. I am a #WalkWith. I am a 48 year old wife of an Army veteran and mother of 3. Since I've been old enough to vote, I've been a Republican. At first it was just falling in line with my family and friends, but after marrying my husband, I started paying attention to how both parties treated the military. That was the start of my personal commitment to the Republican side. What I've witnessed happening to the Dems, especially the last decade or so, scares me. I'm behind anyone who opens their eyes and joins #WalkAway. It gives me hope."
98997551493,"My story isn’t anything great, I was born and raised a conservative with morals and values of a conservative. When I was 18, I dated a guy who was very liberal. I found myself brain washed by the media. I was pro-obama and proud of it. I had lost touch with my religious back ground and was stuck in a rabbit hole. When I started to see the light was when the Michael Brown shooting happened, and I saw how the media and Obama was handling this situation and fueling a fire. Then, the Dallas Ambush with the 5 police officers who died at the hands of a racist happened. I was angry. I was hurt. I was always raised to love thy neighbor. I #walkedaway and haven’t looked back. I can’t back an agenda that is violent but claims to be love and tolerance. I have been attacked by friends and some family (liberal cousins) because I voted for Trump. I voted for him in 2016 and will be voting for him in 2020! Edit: Thank you all for the warm welcome!"
98619010217,"Hi! Just when I thought I'd give up and crawl into a hole of depression with what's happening in this country.. I came across this group!! Thank you #WalkAwayCampaign for giving folks an honest outlet. I was raised in new England, conservative father, Democrat mom. Never was much for politics, as I'm not one for conflict. After moving my family to NC in 2015, I've learned so much (residing in a much more diverse area) . I wanted that for my family! I've always been a thinker and everything I was seeing and hearing just didnt add up. I guess you could've called me a Democrat up north only because I'm FOR the working people. Now that I'm Awake, I can see that the Democrats are doing nothing but keeping thos country down and trying separate folks for their own benefit. They dont give a F* about ""the people"" President Trump has done more for the people of this country than any president EVER. Imagine what he could have accomplished in his time in office if he wasnt constantly being attacked, accused, and held back by the democratic agenda. That part makes me sad, but at least I now know there are people like all of you out there willing to be seen amd heard. As a business owner and performer I try to stay ""neutral"" in all aspects on social media, out of fear that people that don't understand will ruin my business and my families livelihood. That pains me... anyone in this group live in the Raleigh NC area. I've just got to know that I'm not alone here 💗"
99762574459,"Hi!! I’m a #WalkAway , My husband and I have both walked away. My father in law is a Navy Vet and life long Republican . He helped us to see the “light” lol. I never fully identified as a Dem ,but after What I witnessed from 2008-2016 I knew I could never support that party at any capacity again . I love my country and my country people of all walks of life. I truly want to make America great again . I don’t personally know anyone here I don’t think,but I love you anyway and I am happy to be here!!! Thank you for having me!! May God continue to bless us and our amazing President . 💙❤️💙❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
98499140713,"Hey everyone, I'm Matt I've always been the guy who avoids politics. I kinda still believe even both sides are corrupt in some ways and always will be but thats politics. Whenever someone brings up religion or politics id always walk away cause most of the time people are so narrow minded they will never even listen to you. I've always been very open minded. I love the freedom of being outdoors and thats where I spend most of my time so never got into the news, that was until we were forced to stay home and all I could do was watch the news. This is when I saw how horrible the news and democrats were. Id watch first hand a speech trump gave and the second it was over they twisted his words. Now I know this always happens but never at a level like this. These people are so fearful of him becoming president again and that makes me wonder why. Is trump finally actually caring about the people over himself? I think yes and hope I'm not wrong. I could go on and on but ill keep it short. There are some scary things happening in the world and for once as Americans I hope the truth comes out. I hope the corrupt finally go to jail. I wish I had the answers to make things better but I don't, but together maybe we can. Stay safe out there my fellow Americans God bless America 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
98317485068,"I posted previously that I walked away long before it became popular. But in the present I seem to be making so many people mad. They just don’t understand how I can support President Trump. So I posted this: ( bracing for impact) ‘’The Democrat party has lost its way. It it not the same party it was when my dad was a staunch democrat. My father believed that no able bodied person should go on the dole. When Westinghouse went on strike for several months, he moonlighted as a carpenter, my mother did alterations, to put food on the table. I still remember the sign they put in the window. My parents both ‘emigrated’ from Puerto Rico, and their attitude was far different from the people hopping the fence at the southern border. They were proud citizens now,of the best country in the world. They love the flag, the anthem, the constitution. They loved all the opportunity available to anyone willing to work toward a goal. They respected our leaders, our military and law enforcement. They insisted on speaking English, but spoke Spanish to each other, which has afforded me the ability to understand conversational Spanish. I am convinced that if he were alive today, my father would not identify with the Democratic Party. In fact I believe he would be deeply saddened. They lack logic, common sense and patriotism. They seem to encourage anything that would ultimately cause damage and weakness. They claim to have a heart for the oppressed yet their policies are very oppressive and confusing. They sermonize a better way for us to live to protect the environment yet live in enclosed, WALLED mega mansions, and fly private jets everywhere for themselves and their assistants. They are willing to cause damage to the USA and its population as long as there is a chance to make the president look bad. We all need to pray. That This country will turn back to God, that God protects the election, that people will see the truth. And that the media will stop the lies and go back to just reporting the news. It’s not liberals vs conservatives anymore; it’s socialism/communism vs free market. The left is not liberal. Liberalism means tolerance for everything. They are not tolerant. And that’s just my 3 cents! 🥰🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸”"
98126579956,"I chose to #WalkAway about 4 years ago. Hello fellow patriots I'm Amanda. In 2016 my brother in law began to tell me what he has learned about the government and sovereignty and I was intrigued. I began to do my own studying and began to learn everything I had ever known was a lie, the government was not for you, but against you. In a way I guess deep down inside I always had a hunch something wsnt right, I never voted not once for Noone ever I just knew its was rigged. This may seem crazy but sometimes i think Netflix works for the ""good people."" I started watching documentaries about government corruption and my wheels began to spin I dug deeper into these ""conspiracies"" and became sickened with what I found Hillary emails, pedogate, pizzagate and the list goes on, and not to mention the human injustices that the documentaries on Netflix shows which I decided to also become part of the movement to stand up against wrongful imprisonment and i will be graduating this year with a major in criminal law and a minor in criminal justice. Sorry back in topic, a friend of mine invited me to a group #wwg1wga and what I found about about POTUS blew my mind could there actually be a president for the people? I was overwhelmed the joy to find out that the POTUS undercovered the deep state and was going to hold them accountable. I cannot wait to see what happening in the coming days, weeks, and months. I am currently a registered voter and I can not wait for my first time voting ever it will be for a good man 😉"
97870567628,"I have been in this group for a while, reading all the stories about walking with or walking away. I figured it was about time to share mine. I lived in Illinois for 35 years before venturing to Nevada when my dad and sister moved here. Never much into politics, I always had an opinion but never thought my vote mattered or my voice was heard. That is until Trump took office, he has been an inspiration and role model for the last 3 in a half years. Last semester I enrolled at Liberty in political science and plan to graduate in 2023 with my bachelor's degree. I also felt motivated to make a difference in my state and I declared my run for office as State Assembly. I finally found my passion and my voice."
97495829123,"I was never very active in political issues. I think what brought me around was Hilary Clinton and Trump election. I seen the meanness of the Democrats, throwing mud to distract the public. I was confident that my vote would not count because it was against Clinton. I watched my friends on Facebook who I had upmost respect for go crazy that Trump is our president. I listened as my ""friends"" called Trump supports names and threatening our president's life as well as his family. I have watch Trump make good on his promises, while Democrats wasted dollar after dollar on attempts to getting him out of office. I seen the hypocrisy by the Democrats who almost destroyed Kavanagh over an accusation but refused to even investigate a Democratic presidential candidate who is accused of rape and cant stop touching people. I am a mother of 2. I support the law enforcement ( I have a criminal record and experienced bad cops), I find what happened to George Flyod was horrific and needs justice. I respect all people no matter color of their skin. I am not allowed to own a gun but I support 2nd amendment rights! Trump 2020!!!!"
97460881278,I walked away because I couldn't live with myself or my conscience If I had voted for Hillary Clinton. First thing she did that turned me away was her attitude towards Benghazi and the men who died there( she stated in a interview that it was over and done with and people needed to move on) no remorse or apology! Then when she said she knew the man she defended as a lawyer was guilty but she didn't care what it did to that little girl I was appalled! Now after watching President Trump and his family being attacked again and again with false information and so many hateful comments towards me from Democrats I will never go back. They don't want the truth they only want their beliefs and agendas followed and they dont care about the cost! Thank you for having me!!!
97450831814,"Hi... I've never really been into politics, never followed them and I know this is going to sound bad I have never voted in my life. Over the last four years I've really started becoming more interested in politics, politicians and current events. I've always been the type of person to not believe everything you see or read about, I like to do my own research that's when I started seeing how absolutely insane and down right evil the Democratic Party is. Between the far left , CNN, and MSNBC they are complete liars and trying to destroy our country and divide the people. I'm proud to say that this November will be my first time voting and I will vote Trump and all Red in this upcoming election. Open your eyes and your mind and you will see the truth. 🇺🇲"
97074688657,"24 years I have been allowed to vote. Most of those years I had no doubt on where I stood and that was behind the Democratic party. In the spirit of telling the truth, I really did not do my own research and only followed my heart in what I felt was the lesser of the evil sides. I was taught at a young age that the democratic party is who has our backs and would be the ones to fight for our civil rights, freedoms, businesses and for the people no matter what the cost. This may come with age and the fact that I have more to lose based on what I have helped build for myself and my family, but the last few years, I started to take more interest in current political affairs. I started to slowly become disappointed in the things I was learning about the left side. Year 2020, it was like my head exploded with all the information I was coming across on my own without the influence of my family or friends. My family is very split in politics. The older generation is on the right and the younger generation is on the left. I am seeing more hate and anger from the left side than I have ever noticed before. I am seeing how quickly they want to tear someone down for having a different opinion even if the root of the issues is what you agree on. There is no middle ground with the left from what I am seeing, and it is hard to have a real conversation with anyone without being called a racist, uneducated, part of problem, trump lover, tone deaf, etc. All of which are so far from truth. They focus on something I said in a post (a word or one statement) and missed the whole context of the shared thought. Things I have said had been manipulated to fit their narrative. I can then see that the reactions were all out of emotions and not reason. I could also see it was a losing battle and there was no interest in meeting in the middle. I have never once attacked anyone for their own thought on matters, even if it opposed mine. I have never called someone a name or set out to make someone feel stupid for what they believe to be true. I simply believe that all our life experiences are what bring us to where we are at now and for that, we can not get upset at others for thinking differently. But once I started to ask more questions out of concern for our future, how quickly did the left side turn on me and put me into a category. I realized that for many years now that I am more conservative than I wanted to admit. Now I am embracing this about myself and letting the left go their own way. Unfortunately, I have lost good friends and family I loved dearly because of this. I can say that those who I also love who supported the right side never made me feel bad for supporting the left side when we would talk politics. Maybe because I never spoke out of emotions and more so coming from a place of personal experience. We just agreed to disagree and move on. But now that I am on the other side of the fence, the left has certainly showed me that it is their way or the highway. I decided to not apologize any longer for who I am. For that I am now walking away."
96974858837,"Hello, this is my first post. When my granddaughter invited me to this group, I had never heard of WalkAway but I am glad she invited me. Thank you Alexandra. The picture posted here is Ransom, our mustang and my sweet friend Jessica on his back carrying the American Flag. (photo credits go to Jessica) I was raised in a family of Democrats and just went with it because it was the thing to do. Follow in my parents footsteps. A few years ago, I started paying attention a lot more as things just did not feel right. When Obama was elected I was very worried about what was going on, when Hillary got upset at someone they were all dying off mysteriously, I woke up and started to research and think for myself. I decided that I was not going to support the Democrat party any longer. I did not agree with what they stood for, and I hated what they did to our country. After my mind and eyes were open, I could not understand why other people seemed to be blind to what was going on. We were moving toward a Godless country and 'we the people' didn't seem to mind. My father always told me to never just vote for your party, make sure we do the home work and see what we agree with and vote accordingly. I honestly believe, right now if he were still here with us he would rethink that. I believe he would vote straight down the Republic line to try and clean up the mess. Dad always told me that there are two things you can never argue with someone about because it is a never winning battle... Politics and Religion. Seeing how people are blinded to what they do not want to see, I guess he is right. That won't change the fact that I will continue to encourage people to open their eyes and do their homework, check their facts and try to do it with an open mind. I want people to stop allowing a party to brainwash them and tell them how to think and what to do. I never considered myself a conservative until I actually thought about it one day, and realized that yes, I am conservative because of what they stand for and how they believe. I was raised to believe the Democrats were the party who stood up for the people's rights and they were the peaceful party. That's just not true. When my eyes were opened, I noticed the exact opposite. I noticed that Republicans were the party who stood up for the people. I am now registered as a Republican and have been getting a lot of people angry at me for standing up for what I believe. I have actually had ex friends (that I thought were very good friends) tell me to F*** off because I am a tRUMPster. They can call it what they want and be ugly, but I support our President.... 'Final Answer' My husband and I purchased a little 150 acre ranch in Pie Town, NM. and most of the people who live here in Catron county are very conservative so we fit in and get along well. My mother lives with us and she has also switched parties right along side of my husband and I. So.. even though I had never heard of the WalkAwayers, I am proud to be one!"
94806469701,I was a died in the wool democrat for most of my life. I was a demoteen for kennedy and thought that the Democrats were the best thing since sliced bread. I voted for obommer once and after his first term went Republican. The democratic party of old was ok but now it has become a party of do nothings and of hate for anything that doesnt fit their agenda. I worry about my friends who still believe their shit. They hate so much and people are so hyptomized by them that they cant think for themselves and see the bad that is right before their eyes. How dare a party choose to help illegals before Americans who made this country great! If you are still a Democrat you are the problem . Also. I have never heard of a Republican harrasing someone or doing damage to property just because they have a obama or whomever sign or hat or shirt. When obommer was president the Republicans didnt harass Democrats. I have a democrat botton that i used to wear and i modified it so i can now wear it on my Trump hat.
91286972626,"Hi there. Where to begin... I don't even know when I walked away. I feel like I have been my whole life. Really I wasn't sure what I even identified with so I just stayed human, kind, understanding, open minded, but lately with the ""war on people"" I am seeing clear as ever. As long as I can remember I always questioned everything. I always researched and got facts before I spoke. And if i didn't know I asked peoples thoughts. And I would then use my brain to figure out the rest. I always knew I was different. I marched to the beat of my own drum my whole life. I always have accepted people for who they are, what they believe in and in return they should do the same for me, right? Well no. That wasn't happening. Dealing with the left I have realized just how close minded they are. How they use the media to cause diversity, and racism, and push their agendas. I have some ""liberal views"" maybe you could call them? Or more like I am just me. I am pro choice, (depending on situation) I am all for LGBTQ communities, I am for the 2nd amendment. I am agnostic, and wasnt always the flag toting type. I always respected military, I just maybe didn't quite understand the ""nation under god part"" however I do believe in something bigger than me and no its not the government 😂. All jokes aside, I encourage all different types of beliefs. I grew up in a Republican home. I never quite identified one way or the other. But I always knew deep down I was someone who thought on my own. I didnt judge, and I welcomed all views, and challenged conversations in a friendly way. But not all like friendly debates. I walked away from alot of ""friends"" i am not a victim as a woman. I do not believe in ""feminism"" as its portrayed by the left. I believe in empowerment, but that most of the support I have gotten in my life not only came from the strong women in my family, but from the strong men in my life too. I never once in my life felt I was treated differently for being a woman, and most of the time I cringe at the lies alot of woman today spew from their mouths. I believe in all lives. I don't believe in ""my way or the highway"" mentality. I dont let anything define me. I was excited for Obama. Man, I changed my mind rather quickly after that one. Trump wasn't always the best with how he said things, but as I watched him more and more he helped me to realize WHO I am. I am a strong woman who is who she is. I am about freedom, rights, and I refuse to be stripped of those things. Trump has pointed out so much, and its crazy how the democrats can only point fingers. And of course can't back up their assumptions. I think on my own. Always have. I stand with the underdogs. Trump stands with the underdogs too. I may not have always knew what side I was on, I never really ""chose"" sides, but I know what this country was built on, and respect it. I am human. I am for the people. We the people. I will not stand with close minded people who can't even think for themselves. Thanks for listening 💕👊"
83161192841,"I walked away when I first saw Donald Trump was running for President, man I was so excited that another business man was running for the Presidency again. Like probably most of this group, I had gotten sick and tired of these so called professional politicians with their own agenda's and old boy's networking and wanted a self made businessman who actually cared about our country, not how much money they could make as a politician. When I married in 1983, I registered as a Democrat, same as my wife (as she was Democrat and wanted us both to work the Polls together) We had training and became Precinct Clerks and ran Polling Stations for over 20 years. I got to meet a lot of democrats of various offices and positions. In all that time, I only found two totally honest individuals that happened to be in Congress … 20+ years of meeting hundreds of elected officials and I only found two that I would vote for. I came to this great country on December 4, 1982 and found myself become a fiercely Patriotic American Citizen (I had given up my country to become an American, as many other people before me had done) I loved Ronald Reagan and actually punched a moron back in England for disrespecting my President. I have painfully watched American politics get nastier and nastier and was appalled as the corruptness of many politicians started to become known. The Clinton crew are unbelievable and I am convinced that many dems in office are shit scared of them. I have heard first hand from military friends how they are treated by HRC. Well, bottom line, I finally walked away and no longer work at polls. I never batted an eye when so called friends stopped speaking, just like spoiled kids who cannot have their own way. Donald Trump is my President and I will continue to support and defend him. I finally found my no-nonsense President that doesn't take any crap from anyone, calls it as he sees it and is not afraid to be A LEADER. I consider everyone in Walkaway as brothers and sisters with the same vision to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ❤️🙏❤️🇺🇲️Love you ALL"
81113292686,"I’ve been a member for a while now. The town I live in endured a F4 tornado. We lost 18 lives (5 children included) and had over 70 missing. Several other cities in Tennessee were also hit and hit bad. Luckily, my home wasn’t hit. I went on Super Tuesday and voted for our President, donated blood and bought supplies to donate. I commented on a local news story that anyone who couldn’t use their normal polling station due to the tornado could use any polling station according to my local station. I was immediately attacked. I had several people say that I should have died. One said that I should kill myself to make the world a better place. A few wished that my friends and family were killed. All because I voted for President Trump. This only confirmed my decision to walkaway. Our great President visited my town today to survey the damage. And people still have a problem with him doing his job. It’s unbelievable. Luckily, most of my town supports Trump and we didn’t have too many bad comments from residents regarding his visit."
79455798100,"Hi, my name is Josie I guess I’m here to learn and share in the inspiration from these great testimonials and hopefully help to better equip myself in dealing with all these pressures that get in the way while I’m right now standing up and finding my voice. I’ve leaned conservative right my entire adult life and openly trans and embraced by the LGBT community for just over 5 years. I found a network of organizations moving down to South Florida who were instrumental in helping me through the legal process of gender and name change as well as an opportunity for a scholarship program which I successfully completed to become a beauty school graduate and licensed cosmetologist. I’ve always been passionate about political activism from tea party events to Ron Paul campaign for liberty rallies so it was unsettling that I couldn’t bridge the divide to become a voice for the trans community in that respect. I felt I held a unique perspective and could be creative enough to contribute in positive ways that bring us together. This community was so welcoming and I was afraid to upset everyone If I couldn’t find the right words and not only that but I couldn’t find an outlet to be friendly and playfully argue or play devils advocate to promote discussion when to them we weren’t just having ideological differences this was good vs evil there was zero tolerance for my base and insolent world view. Lol There’s basic ridicule and shaming with the same broad brush that reflexively paints bigot and racist when you disagree within the cult. You either hate yourself or are willfully ignorant so your voice doesn’t matter anymore. I was even told by these elitist pricks to sit down and let the grown ups discuss politics For somebody who has been insecure and very shy to speak up as it is, who takes baby steps to be sure they are doing right by everybody especially her daughter, and still has a hard time assuring herself as it is yet alone speak up on what she believes, it’s not cool to flip out when I try to speak. I feel compelled to speak up when I know I’m right and I have conviction to do so and I’m immune to the tactics It got to the point where the radicals started influencing my community to the point Where I had to walk away. I had 19 year old event leaders trying to educate me on gender fluidity and how gender is a social construct and non binary and that there was no debate on trans in sports or bathrooms, that I’m either with or against. So walking away was the appropriate response when I felt I could do nothing from within the trans and LGBT community. That was in Washington DC and immediately after I returned home to Florida a friend introduced me to probably one of the most prominent women fighting for freedom of speech in this country. We made friends and I’m now an advocate for LGBT representation on the right and a part of her congressional campaign. She’s such an inspiration and is helping me find it within me to stand up and speak out as well. 🦁❤️ She’s even banned on social media because she’s a threat to the establishment or I would tag her in this post #loveyouLaura #stopthebias #walkaway"
78443748464,"I was once center-left until leftists tried to convince me to vote for policies that would hurt me ranging from higher taxes meaning paying more out of my income to open-borders. It is true that I am of Vietnamese immigrant background, a Buddhist, and a furry. At the same time, I believe in law and order because that's what every country has. Why should America allow people who won't learn to fit-in and learn about the country first when we can't even take care of our own Native American tribal peoples? That's why I completely lost faith and trust in the Democrat and decided going full Republican would be best for America. America is a federal republic; a nation of states each with their own government. Republicans believe in limited government and more states rights. I also think state governments do a better job helping poor citizens in their states than the feds can. Because of all of this, I'm voting Trump and Republican all the way. No illegals in America, no Sharia law in America, low taxes, complete with policies that puts American citizens first as well as letting the states tackle poverty better than the feds can. I also believe in a federal chain-of-command because if states are already paying a portion of their state budgets to the federal government as taxes, then it is pointless for the feds to levy taxes on American citizens and their properties directly. It should be the states that taxes American citizens and their properties or however they collect revenue from American citizens (like public utility usage)."
76865708040,"I don't know if any of you guys recall me from about a year ago explaining that my husband and I are the epitome of what liberals hated, but I'm just checking in to say hello again and congratulate those who have chosen to #walkaway. Fun facts about my husband and I : 1. We live in Southern California. 2. Im married to a hispanic man whom is a legal citizen and doesn't know a lick of Spanish. 3. My husband is incredibly patriotic and hangs a large American flag in his office. During the Super Bowl we stood for the National Anthem and put our hands across our hearts. 4. We are people of faith and believe in God and keeping our country God centered. 5. We aren't homophobic and we have many gay friends. Believe it or not, we love our brothers and sisters and choose to not judge others just the way Jesus taught us. 6. I used to be a homeless junkie 4 years ago and literally lost everything. My home, my car, my job, my entire storage unit of all my precious belongings and my cat. (See picture below) 7. My husband and I love our home state because its ""home"" but we cant stand what it has become. We have accepted that we will eventually have to leave California and it breaks our hearts. 8. Neither of us have a college education and we work hard for our money. I manage a veterinary hospital while he works at a cook in a kitchen. We dont have any government assistance and we pay our taxes. 9. We tried for about two years to conceive, and by Gods grace and power we are now expecting our first born July 2020. 10. I plan to homeschool my child for obvious reasons. 11. We fully support and love President Trump but literally cant express our opinions on our workplace or to others that live around us because we are in fear of hate crimes and our life being threatened. Its a real and sad reality that we live with everyday. Its not hard to understand when you live in a city that is primarily illegal aliens whom dont speak English. 12.

76740699442,"Thank you for accepting me.. I was a Democrat all my life im 54. My girlfriend vited for Trump in 2016 and her and i would get into fights all the time i almost broke up with her caused i didnt want nothing to do with a trumpster I called her a traitor and back stabber to our democratic party but most of all a traitor to me. But through the years she would show me little articles on Facebook and twitter that at the time i really didnt grasp onto but in time i started doing my own research on the stuff she had mentioned and came to the conclusion that maybe i was really ignorant and did not know a darn thing bout what or why i was hating on TRUMP.. Then the whole impeachment inquiry was so unfair, unjust and not right.. So when i saw what was being done by the democrats i said im done as a Democrat im going to vote TRUMP.. Now im a big fan and supporter. Our government has being corrupt for so long and i ALWAYS thought it was the Republican party behind it but i was wrong"
75948873687,"This morning I found the Times in my driveway. A warm feeling crept over me as I remembered the good old days of reading the paper from front to back and doing crosswords. Like a gift waiting on my driveway to be opened, I would run out in my robe when it was a cold morning, and then run back in to the house hoping someone would not see me in my state of dress early in the dim light of dawn. It was a memory of the past that gave me a thrill this Sunday morning. That feeling did not last long. As I quickly ran through the headlines, and then began to read the stories, the memory quickly faded to disgust. There was no longer any balanced views or even slightly veiled bias. The ""News"" was now a left wing opinion piece only fit for the opinion pages of a Ripley's believe it or not or a conspiratorial youtube video. It was so obvious I wondered how anyone still read it. I had long ago seen the writing on the wall as more and more rich liberals and their progressive masters began to gobble up all the independent papers. When they finished that, they started buying out and closing those papers that only leaned just left of center. It continued till they destroyed all sense of balance. The progressives were already heavily involved in public radio groups like NPR and PBS. They pretty much had a lock on all news in the early 80s and had rededicated the boomers in to believing any of the pap they handed out as the ""truth."" Now I must share some context. I was born in 1955. I was a woke liberal. I was just opening my eyes to the real world of the red pill. I had been devastated by the loss of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan. I had fallen for all the fear mongering that made Reagan the great satan who would destroy the world. I was anti authoritarian. I hated that the ""man"" was keeping me down. I struggled to make it, pay check to pay check, paying my dues because ""you cant fight the man."" Then my mother gave me a book that changed everything for me. It was written in the 50s by a woman who had escaped the bolshevik revolution in Russia. It was like the red pill in the Matrix. As I read it, everything finally began to make sense. All of a sudden I realized that I was the one who had been brainwashed. The radicals of the 60s were the actual "" man"" I was told to fear and hate. They were the communists clothed as white knights, come to rescue us all from evil capitalists who wanted to control us. It was 1983 and I was driving to a job where I lived in the pelican state, listening to talk radio for the latest news and opinion. It was before Fox news was even a thought. As I scanned through the stations I heard a man speaking from a Seattle station. He was speaking words that were like precious water to a dry and thirsty soul. His words confirmed what I had read in the book. He was putting the pieces together, connecting the dots, and slowly I began to fully comprehend the awesome responsibility the knowledge I was hearing required of those with the ""ears to hear."" It was a huge sea change for me. As a Christian, in more than name only, I had committed myself to the Truth that God was the only Truth. That God would give wisdom and knowledge to those who fully were surrendered to His Truth. It was the guiding principle I now embraced in all my broken humanness. I trusted God completely with my future, as completely as I could at that time. Let me be perfectly clear. I was far from perfect at that. But it was the intent of my heart to follow and trust God, the Father of Jesus. It was my intent to understand what Jesus meant to the world, in God's purpose. And you know what? I began to see the clear and present danger satan posed through those on the left. I began to realize that politics were where the battle between good and evil was being fought at the highest levels. At the highest levels that I had always eschewed as being unimportant to life at my level. It is at this point I understood why there is a scripture that says to pray for those over us so that we might have peace. The battle I was ignoring was the war the devil did not want me, as a Christian, involved in. This is not just a battle over morals. Those battles are fought within our own souls. This is a battle for justice and truth. It is what God expects from the people He calls the light, a city on a hill. God called out a new people, as He did with Abraham. The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of Jesus, also called a people from the shores of Europe to create a new nation. A nation that would put God first. A nation who adopted the motto, ""In God We Trust."" A nation who has enjoyed the fruits of His blessings because it honored Him in the beginning. The left has done all it can to separate us from that original commitment. It first took God out of its law schools when it abandoned the Blackstone book. It took God out of our schools when it insisted that the separation of Church and State was a protection of the Government from the Church (truncated)"

Two reasons: One, I had FINALLY had enough of the elitist insults the liberals/leftists had been hurling at Trump supporters and at rural working class white people in general...insults which began with Obama's bitter clinger slurs against western Pennsylvanians, and went to Hillary Clinton's ""Deplorable "" comment about Trump supporters, to the racist, classist, and sexist comments that I saw coming from liberals and leftists online, against Trump supporters...including some truly laughable ones thrown in my direction after I became a supporter of Trump. Two, I finally realized what this whole impeachment charade was all about: a frantic attempt by the left to prevent Trump from appointing a conservative replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsberg."
74004940377,"I vote for who I think can make positive changes for the country. I don’t vote for the party. I vote for the country. I actually voted for Obama on his first term but because of my disappointment with his bad policies, I voted for Romney. Romney had his chance but never made it. Obama was only good on public speaking but ended up differently and I didn’t like the changes he did for the country. I was very disgusted. I felt like he was a weakling President and many Americans felt the same way. During the 2016 primary, I actually voted for Ted Cruz who I have so much respect for. I was disappointed when DJT became the nominee. I didn’t want DJT during the primary because of the way he say things that offends his opponents and which makes them freak out. He isn’t careful in saying things. He always name names as well. When DJT became the nominee, I listened and watched his rallies all the time and I became curious about his plans for Americans and for the country compared to what other candidates of both parties have to say. I thought of I am tired of politicians lies during campaigns and after election the opposite happens. I was curious about what he promised in his campaigns. I was hoping he was not like real politicians who make promises and fond of saying flowery words to attract voters like Obama. Then, DJT became the 45th President of the United States. So far, I am pleased by what Pres Trump is accomplishing for the country in just a short period of his Presidency compared to Obama’s and other past presidents. I am learning that there needs to be fixed which Pres Trump is trying to change which other past presidents never attempted to fix like unfair trade of countries with the US, etc. I like the way he drains the swamp. If not because of him the corruption and dirt of the left would never be exposed. I can see Pres Trump is doing his best to fix the mess of the past for the good of this great nation which liberals do not like. The fact that he is doing what he promised in his campaigns make me contented. With his policies I feel safer with him as our President. I am happy with his accomplishments so far on the economy, unemployment, building of the walls at borders, his try to stop abortion which is unChristian, lower taxes, and so on and so forth. I love whenever he say “America first” in his rallies. I love when he never misses saying “In God We Trust” in all his rallies. He also does not like socialism which is not good for any country. I do not like that democrats of these days are for socialism, reparation, open borders with free stuff to illegals in the US at the expense of the taxpayers while US citizens are struggling to survive, giving the right to vote to illegal immigrants, high taxes, and many others. The democrats of today are no longer the John F Kennedy democrats of the past. I hate what the left in Congress and the liberal mainstream media is doing to the President. I hate when they can not accept defeat and can not move on and keep on demonizing and destroying him by making up lies and stories to mislead the public instead of supporting their own President. Yet he continues to keep on winning for Americans. They are like praying that their plane crashes with their families just because they do not like the pilot. I am in favor of the President’s tweeting where the public read and hear the truth straight from him and I believe them more than what the leftist media is showing to the public that more often are twisting what he actually said. I realize I don’t care about how he say things that offend others. I don’t care about his past on women. I don’t care about this type of personality of him. I don’t care about his past. I realize whenever he say things he is just frank and actually saying what is actually true. I care more about what he can do for Americans and for this country."
72493442785,"I’m a walk with. I was not interested in politics until i had a politics class at college over a year ago. Even though I was not politically active, I still voted for president Trump in 2016. The class encouraged me to research politics and I watch YouTube videos about politics. I watch The next news network, Dr. Steve Turley, Timcast, Steven Crowder, and more. I would recommend looking up those YouTube channels. And I also watch other people’s #walkaway videos. Their are many videos of #walkaway videos of people who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 planing on voting for him in 2020 because he did a lot of good for this country, and the media is constantly lying about his since he became president. With all my research I found out how big of layers the Democrats are. They keep lying about the president of things he did with no evident, like with Russia meddling with the election. They also try to intimidate people with name calling, slander, and threats of violence. And i’m Discussed with the behavior of the far left with Antifa and think that they are nothing but thugs. And so, I encourage other people to walk away as well. Don’t let the far left and Democrats intimidate you because they only have power over you when they frighten you. So stand strong and with courage and don’t let their name calling get to you. I’ll gladly vote for Trump 2020 for all the good he does for this country."

I was especially nervous about coming out because of the blue state that I live in, and feel that I was right to ""pretend"" to be a democrat as long as i did when i had my own business, just to stay under the radar. I say that because it seems like as soon as i changed my affiliation, for some reason my business got audited, even though the business was sold the year before :( I believe most of the liberals & unhinged Democrats out there today are the same kids from school who bullied others, cut lines, and would tell the teacher on you when ""they"" did something wrong, this is when they learned to deflect, and it felt like the teachers were the enablers. I also believe that's when they started feeling entitled, and their parents helped them keep that entitlement feeling alive by telling them ""they would take care of it"", ""It"" being anytime they got into trouble! I am so happy about this group, when i saw Brandon start the group a year ago, all i could do is hope and pray it would catch on, now, a year later i believe it has not only caught on, but will be a game changer :) That's My two cents..."

She was removing phonics from the reading lessons and my son was told not to sound out words but look at the pictures and guess. It was called ""whole language"" but it was the ""look say"" experiment that had failed thousands of children in the early '50s. I researched further and learned it was more than just phonics, the history texts were now decidedly slanted with liberal bias and children were being told to answer questionaires such as who did yourparents vote for. So enough parents were alarmed and recognized the purposeful dumbing down. Clinton hinted that too many people were over-educated for the work they were doing. so I guess that was where the dumbing down fits in. So the next generation will be so poorly educated they will be happy in menial jobs, or in about 20 years they will vote for Hillary. That's when homeschooling took off.

They refuse to formally condemn the hate speech of Ilhan Omar, no Democrat lawmakers attended the opening of our embassy in Jerusalem, they essentially voted for BDS, none of their candidates spoke at the AIPAC conference and they took up for the mastermind of 9/11 at Gina Haspel's hearing!

I didn't vote and I went about my days naively thinking that no matter who got into the presidential seat would do a good job. I never officially identified with either political group and I was happy. But I was still in the middle leaning to the left. I took my freedom and liberties for granted thinking they were always going to be there. When Obama got into office, I didn't think much of it until it affected my insurance. Then, I took noticed and wasn't happy. When 2016 rolled around I started getting interested in politics. I knew it was down to Trump and Hillary and remembering how she was I didn't want her. I remember the Monica scandal and knew that if she didn't stand against her husband for his wrong doing, then she didn't care about me. I also didn't like all of Hollywood getting involved and telling me to vote for me which REALLY turned me off. Plus, Hillary said that Trump supporters were deplorables.

Many conservatives could not really explain what it is because honestly, no one is taught what it is or the Constitution or who the Founding Fathers REALLY were and what they truly believed. We have continually let the Left define who we are—they say we are racist, bigoted, homophobic, sexist, uneducated, unintelligent, hate the poor, .....the list goes on. We are NONE of those things. I think a good simple way to define conservatism is that we value LIBERTY over security. We value freedom and small government over the false sense of security big government supposedly gives us. We value individual responsibility over the nanny state taking “care” of us. We value individual liberty over the common “good.” Basically we want the government to leave us the heck alone.

I was shocked back then to learn that the infamous “Keating Five” Senators accused of facilitating the scam included four Democrats – two of whom I had long admired. When John Glenn and Alan Cranston turned out to be corrupt, I started to wonder if other Democrats might actually be noble-sounding scoundrels on the take. Also in the 1980s, researchers began to report that the Democrats’ signature legislation of the ‘60s – LBJ’s “War on Poverty’ – was turning out to be a disastrous (truncated)"

I am a History major because as an Army brat I was able to touch history, like the tarmac on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. I was able to see all the broken glass of hangars, and walk on the very ground many American heroes paid the ultimate sacrifice. In fifth grade, I was in a majority civilian school. When we went on our trip to D.C., I was the only child crying while touching the names of soldiers on the Vietnam Memorial. When my teacher asked why I was crying, I replied “because my dad’s name is not on here”. I knew then at the age of 10 the ultimate sacrifice that so many brave Americans paid. I was proud of my dad and all of those beautiful names carved in that wall. I was raised to see beyond color by two Southerners. I was raised to respect people and their views.

It was a great time to grow up. My parents were democrats, so I was a democrat. They taught us that Dems were the party of the working man, the middle class, and Republicans were only for rich people. But I had a feeling that Democrat policies were wrong, even when I was a kid. The Detroit riots scared me. The rioting at the Democrat Convention in 1968 scared me. I thought giving welfare to women in 1965 so they didn't have to work was a bad idea. I'd feel pretty bad if my dad had to leave the house just so my ma could get a government check. So even when I was a kid, I'd think ""that's not right"".

I began reading alternative political literature by age 12 and soon realized that the newspaper articles were vastly different compared to what I was reading. At 18, I initially registered as a Republican but changed my affiliation to Independent by the time Ross Perot burst onto the scene in 1991.

I've seen many posts on here saying they will only vote Republican being conservative. I find that to be like betting on the superbowl without watching the season. Everyone wants to be a winner but we have been losing for decades with this mentality. I encourage you all to rethink 3rd parties and vote for them to gain momentum and hear your voice for a change. It only takes a minority leader in the house or Senate to put stability of a 3rd party. Even the 5% vote in presidential will give them a chance to debate and hit them in the public campaign funds. I have also seen people say they can't vote in primaries for 3rd party. Maybe you can't but you can vote against the greater evil or for the worst of the 2 candidates of the greater evil to insure a loss. Voting for your belief isn't about instant gratification it's about a chance of change for the future!

My #walkaway started in the mid to late 90s when I bought a franchise and became a business woman. I experienced first hand two things: 1. The local government does everything they can to prevent small businesses from getting off the ground and succeeding. 2. Some people take advantage of unemployment compensation.
