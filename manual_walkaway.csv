"Technically I walked away Sun. March 21 as I watched a 5 hour live video by David Wilcock. Now mind you I was primed and ready. That was my first day of quarantine and I work in a metaphysical setting and already heard about Trump not being who we think he is. But I didn't even know about the goodies just waiting to be found on YouTube. Egde of Wonder, 3D to 5D Consciousness, Elizabeth April and x22 Report quickly became my favorite channels although 4 months later I'm over 20 I check on. I am a retired special education teacher and early on in Trump campaigning, when he mocked the disabled reporter, that was it for me. That moment I bought that he's a complete jerk and I fell right in line on the hate train. Plus as a life long Democrat, Republicans never helped teachers at contract time...it was the Democrats. I thought Democrats worked to help the little guy while Republicans worked to protect their money with tax loopholes for themselves while living off the backs of middle class America. But then the virus came along and things just weren't adding up...I saw Pelosi calling everyone down to Chinatown that its no big deal. The next day Trump closed our borders to China and gets criticized as racist...then some weeks down the line try to make it seem what a fuck up he is and he didn't act fast enough. Whoah! Now the MSM manipulation is glaringly obvious to me. But thanks to David I know about the cabal, what evil they're trying to hide, and how MSM is designed for *programming* our minds and controlling how we think. When the veil shifts; everything shifts! Where once I couldn't stand looking at or listening to Trump, I see how he talks in codes coordinated with Q. I had heard of Q, now I was following Q. On one hand it was exhilarating to learn the real truth; on the other learning this truth is a nightmare. Then comes excitement...when I knew and got it...I couldn't wait to share with my family and friends. I was so naive...most of my family immediately wrote my news off as junk...conspiracy theory bull the whole nine yards. My girlfriend of 40 years and I do not speak on the phone anymore. My old teacher friends think something happened to my mind. It hurt my heart but couldn't stop what became my contract to fulfill. You see my life path number is 5...5 is freedom fighter. I started red pilling Mon. March 22...I'll never forget the first words out of my mouth: OMG...the ones we love and respect are bad...the ones we hate are the Patriots! Didn't matter...and to this day none that I'm aware of has remotely changed their minds. 2 women tried delving and they walked away still not getting it. I realized the MSM did a fucking job on dividing us. Mind you, my gf of 40 years is a retired high school English teacher and probably taught 1984 more than I can count and I asked her once you don't think we're in 1984??? Or worse??? I just don't get it. As the virus hell grew and it became apparent that the cities and states that had the worst issues were all dem controlled. Segway to the rioting...same thing...look at the dem candidate for president! There's something not right with Biden...and they still don't wake up! I actually came out to my people using these facts saying I just can't support what the dems are anymore...I'm a walkAway! And damn proud of that! I have one request. To combat the division in our country, it is time to plaster our homes, neighborhoods, towns, states with American flags again like we did for 9/11! Blessed be.",0
"My #WalkAway story has similarities to many of yours' that I have taken the time to read. This is mine…… (while trying to keep it as short as possible) I'm 51 years old. I was happily raised a Democrat by my schoolteacher/nurse mother and my stepfather who was a union tile worker in the Northeast. Democrats were the party of hard working patriotic Americans, and this was the truth. I worked hard like my parents taught me, having many jobs through high school and then college where I graduated with an Engineering degree from a state university. I was never indoctrinated by my schools or teachers back then and got a great education. Once I was voting age, I voted Democrat. After working for a large international company for many years, living and working in various countries, my appreciation for the opportunities the US had, and my love of America grew. I left the company I worked for and started my own business in 1997. Over 20 years it organically grew into a small but relevant company in the international power generation market. I was changed during the second Bush administration, and not for the better. I went further left before I went right. We were providing contractors in Iraq during the war to assist in rebuilding their power generation infrastructure. I had several employees there that I would Skype with every day. They would tell me of how the military was running around the place with truck loads of dollars giving the money away to bribe and pay off all the local tribes and governments there. It really infuriated me that our taxpayer money was squandered like that while there were so many in need back home. Then Obama came along promoting his promise of change for our country. It was exactly what I though the country needed, big change, and so I voted for Obama during his first term. Unfortunately the change never came. Identity politics made me think I was on a different planet, let alone America. Obama era regulations on my industry made it harder and harder for us to compete as a small company for jobs that we needed to survive. The playing field was no longer level. I felt like I got sold a bill of goods for voting for him, as nothing he did aligned with my values and the ‘Change’ never came. From my experience, the party had changed and was no longer the party for the little guy or working man. Seemed to me it was more the party of division, identity politics, and power. My first vote against the party came in 2012. Unfortunately Obama got his second term and things didn’t get better….more of the same. Then 2016. An abrasive New Yorker came along that was a fighter, a winner, and above all a Patriot. All of the things that I thought were going wrong with this country he said he would fix if elected. He made sense to me and he got my vote. I’m not a very religious person, but actually prayed the night of the 2016 election. Not for him to win, but for God to make the outcome of the election turn out to be what was best for our country. The rest is history. Since then, the Democrats in power have proven to not have the country in their best interest. They hate Donald Trump more than they love our great nation. I continue to pray now and then that God will do what is best for our country. I will accept the results of a fair election as God’s will, and support The President.",0
"So 4 years I voted for Hillary. I just couldn't stomach Trump. Even though he stood for a lot of what I valued I chose the other side. I've been an Independent ever since I turned 18 and have always valued the right to vote. I started to side with the left alot because I wanted people to have the same rights-equality. But in the last 3 months I saw a difference in how the left saw things and how they were handling it. Burning down the country and such hatred coming out for people who thought differently. No tolerance. It really shook me to my core and I just couldn't in good conscience be a part of it. My husband laughs at me because he is a big conservative and watching me get ""woke"" has been an adventure especially in regards to some of my family. I am grateful for this community and those who have chosen to ""walk away"". Knowing your not alone. I want this country to be a place my kids can grow but I'm worried where it is being taken. God bless all those who have seen the light!! ❤",0
"Hey I am Jennifer Nelson, I #walkwith you. I am lifelong conservative. I went to a very liberal college and was often quickly silenced by my opposing views. I put God first, then my family, then country. I have been harassed, cornered, and alienated because I am conservative. In the end of your gay, I respect you, if you have more skin melanin than me I respect you. I believe all lives and people matter and have felt this way for many years. My God tells me we are “all precious in his sight” therefore I can’t argue with the man upstairs. Our voices matter and we will not be divided. I #walkwith you and respect you.",1
"I don’t have my own “walk-away” story because I have always voted Republican, but I wanted to say that each of you, and every story you’ve posted has encouraged me – you’ve given me hope that our country is not lost to the radical left. Thank you for the courage you’ve displayed by speaking up. May God bless and protect each of you because I’m sure you have or will face backlash. Today I faced some of that backlash myself, which has prompted this post. For 4 long years, I’ve watched one of my friends call our current President every vile and evil name in the book. I’ve never spoken up – she’s entitled to her opinion, right? But yesterday she posted a “meme” showing President Trump playing golf and beside the picture were stats showing how many Americans died from Covid while he played 9 holes. So, I finally had the courage to speak up about the inconsistent way this President has been treated from almost any other President that I can remember by simply stating that President Trump is not the only President to play golf during a critical time in our country. I pointed out that it seems there has been one set of rules for him versus other Presidents. I went even further to say that I don’t always like or agree with some of the things President Trump says nor the way he expresses himself, and instead tried to make the conversation about respect for the Office of the President rather than the individual. No matter who holds that Office, we should lift him/her up in prayer and respect the Office. She simply told me to block her as a friend. So – that is it in a nutshell. The Democratic party has mostly devolved into a party that doesn’t care about you or your opinion unless you agree with them. That is NOT the America I want to live in. I pray that we all make our voices heard on November 3rd, and I pray that we can preserve the freedoms and integrity of this great country.",1
"I had my eyes wide shut! No other way to put it really. I feel like I have been woke from my brainwashed stupor. I have cut the puppet strings. I feel like many of you. Seeing things that led me to believe what I was seeing was the truth. Only to find out that I was truly being lied to and manipulated. Well I'm awake now! I know who I'm voting for. May God protect us all, in Jesus name, Amen!!",0
"I’ve been a part of this group for 2 years now, I think... more than 1 for sure. I’ve been reading everyone’s testimonials and LOVING them but I haven’t had the guts to post my own. My story doesn’t feel interesting, I’m a horrible writer and I couldn’t figure out what picture to use (seriously). Here goes: My parents illegally immigrated from Mexico (they're citizens now!). In the early ‘80s they headed up north to the current murder capital of America (Chicago) and a couple of years later I was born. Due to their educational levels, lack of English and illegal status we were poor, dirt poor, salt tacos poor. We lived in garages, basements, small apartments with other family members to get by. During this time my parents never complained or accepted handouts, even though they could’ve because I am a natural born citizen, they didn’t want them. Then came the Amensty of ‘86, God bless Ronald Reagan, a Republican, he changed their lives and mine. My parents got their green cards and now qualified for minimum wage (companies who hired illegal immigrants paid half of minimum wage and if anyone complained they’d threaten deportation, so they got away with slave wages), there was no more hiding or getting taken adavantage of. We got nicer things, better living arrangement but the thing with Chicago is that people notice when you have nice things so they take them, by force. We had our apartment set on fire, cars stolen, cars set on fire when they couldn’t steal them. This is was all on top of the shootings and tripping over dead drug addicts on my way to school. The same Democratic politicians promising change in the ‘80s were failing, Lightfoot's failures aren't new. In ‘94 my parents made a hard choice and it was a choice I will be forever grateful for. They cleared out their savings, left everything and everyone they knew behind and moved to Texas. We were still poor when we got to Texas so we lived in what they called ghetto, but it was heaven compared to Chicago. Within a year my parents had enough to buy a house then I graduated from High School, joined the military and traveled all over the world. **I was a registered Democrat** I didn't know anything about politics beyond Dems are for minorities and Republicans are racist. I started out my time in the military under Bush Jr. and things were great, even with high deployment tempos we had morale. In 2008 I, the Democrat, voted for ""Hope and Change,"" I wanted to be a part of history. It took no time to see a morale decline in the troops. Everything was getting cut, our Commander in Chief didn't seem to like us, we were deploying with new rules of engagement that put us in more danger, there was little hope and the change sucked. In 2012 I flipped and voted Romney. I didn't love Romney but I couldn't stomach Obama. I was sad when he was announced the winner but I thought ""Oh well, it's just 4 years."" The damage done by the Democratic party in those 4 years cemented my Conservative status. I didn't vote Trump in 2016, I thought he was running as a joke. The man was a well known pro-choice, Hollywood loving Democrat so I wrote in Jesus. I've seen what President Trump has managed to accomplish since January of 2017. Even with the monkey poo being flung by the media, the House of representatives, Hollywood and the RINOS... he was never a joke. He loves this country, he loves all citizens (born and unborn, skin color be damned), he loves our military and I will proudly pull the lever for him on November 3rd, unless I vote early, then it'll be some time in October. Sorry this was so long! God bless y'all and keep up the good work🇺🇸",0
"Hello everyone! I’ve been a member of the group for a long time but I’ve never shared my story. I guess everyone would consider me a WalkWith instead of a WalkAway. I have always been an Independent voter with a moderate conservative take on life agreeing with different things on each side of the aisle. In a Nutshell… I am a Christian Conservative who loves God, Our Awesome Country, and Our Flag. I love and accept all People regardless of Race, Sexual Orientation, Religious Beliefs, or Political Party. I choose my friends based upon their Character and nothing else! I have great friends from all walks of life. I support our Military and our Police. I believe in the 1st and 2nd Amendments, Women’s Rights, EVERYONE’S Rights, I’m Pro-Life, I believe that ALL Lives Matter, and I support Economic and Energy Sustainability. All of this being said, I have to be very careful about what I do and say on Social Media because my husband and I are small business owners of 3 micro businesses, and Social Media can destroy businesses as much as they can help businesses. My husband is a vocational school teacher and we all know that a teachers salary is not great, so my husband calls me his “Pimp” as I send him out to do side work for clients (HVAC, Electrical, Carpentry, etc), and for our private event Disc Jockey company. I am an Event Planner and Wedding Officiant. So we stay busy… Well at least we used too! We have been experiencing issues on two fronts. First all, the Hypocritical Hate from the far left. Those who criticized conservatives who didn’t want to compromise their religious beliefs to provide services, now those liberals are not wanting to work with those conservatives whose beliefs don’t align with theirs! This has affected our businesses not necessarily from potential clients but from other vendors in our fields. We have lost what we call “Friend’or’s”, Vendor Friends, in our industry when they have discovered we lean right. No room for civil discussion on what we support and don’t support. If we don’t support the Big D 100% they don’t want to discuss anything or work with us. Second, COVID… We went from what was in January looking to be the best year on the books in 10 years, to one of the worst ever by the end of March. The entertainment / wedding industry has taken a huge hit and to say the least having no events for 4 months has hit us hard. Being micro businesses we did not qualify for any type of assistance. The saving grace for us is that my husband is still getting his teachers salary, he has been able to do side work for people while school has been closed, and I am still able to perform wedding ceremonies for those who want to have small family “elopements”. We know it could have been much worse for us as we have watched several of our Friend’or’s lose their businesses because of the Covid Shutdown. Those Vendors blame Trump for all of their Woes instead of those that they should be taking a hard look at… the Democrats and themselves. In Summary… I WalkWith everyone here regardless of “who” you are. I WalkWith you because you have the Strength of Character to follow your own path and to not let someone else dictate to you how to conduct your life. I hope you WalkWith me because I do the same. I humbly ask that you support all Small / Micro Businesses that have been affected by the Liberal Hate and the Covid Shutdown in our country so that they can survive to work another day, and to grow our economy and our great country. This year I will once again Vote for Trump to continue to Make America Great Again! God Bless You ALL!",1

"Thank you for the add to this amazing group! I'm a 60 yr. old life long Democrat woman, who joined the #WalkAwayCampaign during Donald Trump's campaign for POTUS. It was inspiring to see a man who was NOT a politician bring common sense & logic to the White House. I joined the Republican Party during his campaign. After years of being disillusioned by the Left's version of what this country should be. I've lost friends & family because of my decision, but have no regrets. I'm looking forward to 4 more years of President Trump and our beautiful country going in the right direction. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲",0
"Man, I joined this group about a month after this group was created when we were just under 100k members! It sure warms my soul to see how far the walkaway campaign has come since then! I pray the demoncrats don’t get their way and cheat to win by mail in ballot voting! God bless America, and God bless you all! #Trump2020 🥰 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",NA
"🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Born and raised in a conservative Christian home... Always voted Republican... but 2016 didn’t set well with me. The “choice” of candidates was frustrating and caused me to feel limited! WHY would a daughter of a devout Christian .. with two sisters, vote for a man that spoke so terrible ABOUT and TO women?! WHY would my Dad (father of 3 daughters, brother of 3 sisters, grandfather of 4 granddaughters, Uncle to 5 nieces) vote for this man?! Based on what I was forcefed for a solid year... the protest against Donald J Trump ... the solid efforts of the conjoined media... I had been persuaded and thought my Dad had left his beliefs behind... and I voted for Gary Johnson. (Killary was NEVER an option) Once the Plandemic hit... I had some free time on my hands to really dig into DJT and what he’d been doing these last few years. I watched my first COVID briefing and then saw the media posts. Hmmm... I watched a few more briefings and then media posts. That’s when a light came on and I realized I had been fed a TON OF LIES about our President. I am here to tell you - God has placed DJT in this position at this very time to help America stand up! I am going to #WalkAway from the media and lies I missed the train 4 years ago... But REFUSE to miss it this year #Trump2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",1
"I am a #WalkWith. I have always been on the side right. So far, I have seen nothing but narcissistic behavior from the left. They want to crucify republicans for exactly the same thing democrats are doing. Democrats are doing things to stir the pot then blame it on the Republicans. Any small amount of research shows just how true this is. What gets me is how I can watch a news conference and not five minutes later, the media is saying exactly the opposite of what was said or telling us something happened that didn't. I know I am not the only one who sees this happening and I am so grateful for this group because I have friends that are so far gone and drank so much of the Kool-Aid, I can't even begin to think about how to bring them back. It doesn't mean I don't love them any less... It just gives me less I can talk to them about.",1
"American from Massachusetts (mixed race) currently living in Victoria, Australia. Actually, I should say stuck in Victoria, Australia, as my Leftist state is holding us all captive! I am not allowed to leave my neighbourhood, let alone the country. I feel compelled to write this walkaway story to warn everyone in America of what could happen if they let the Democrats take power of the Whitehouse again. Victoria is the most Leftist state in all of Australia. Our COVID-19 response has been disastrous under this Leftist state government regime. RT recently wrote an article about how we have the strictest lockdown in the world! I can confirm that is true! We have had about 247 deaths nationwide (to date), all mainly within nursing homes. The Premier of Victoria decided that we are now in 'A state of Disaster' and enforced a stricter lockdown on us. BTW, this is only happening in Victoria, not the rest of Australia. We have been in Stage 3 Lockdown for 5 straight months. A few days ago, they put us into Stage 4 for an additional 2+ months. We don't really know if it will end there, as the Premier is threatening Stage 5 if this Stage 4 is not successful. We don't really know what that means, but he said it would ""radically change the way we live"". Basically, we are all under house arrest - Police have the right to enter your home without a warrant. We have curfews and can only leave our homes once a day, for one hour (although they do not want you leaving your house at all!). Masks are mandatory outdoors and indoors. Nearly every business is closed, so millions of people have been unemployed for the length of this Lockdown. We have been told there will be meat shortages soon, as more businesses were forced to close as per the restrictions of this Stage 4. We are not allowed to leave our suburbs and we are not allowed to see friends or family. This is inhumane! And now, here is the kicker... Our Premier announced that our lives will NOT go back to normal until EVERY Victorian gets the new vaccine they are working on for COVID-19! Yes, you heard that right. We cannot get out of lockdown until we get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate! I do not want to be forced into being injected with a rushed vaccine that has not been tested. We are clearly the guinea pigs of some very sinister plans. This is not normal! Australia does not have a Bill of Rights like America. We have been easily controlled and whipped into submission with the threat of this virus. Please share this story! People need to understand what is happening here. We cannot allow these maniacs to implement this agenda. This affects us all, not just Victoria!",NA
No need to welcome me as I have already shared my story before.... I just want to say I just LOVE this group and so very glad I joined. I have read so many stories you all have shared today and it gives me such hope for our country. I am so grateful there is so many that feel the way my husband and I do. Jim has always been a walk with and I am a walk away. So so glad my eyes were opened with Obama. I am grateful to live in America and have a president who truly loves this nation and works so hard for our behalf. Trump2020!! We all have to get out and vote. It's a scary thing to think what would happen if we don't elect Trump to serve another 4 years. Feel free to friend request me if you want to be friends with someone who is now a Republican and proud of it!! Let me know you are from WalkAway.,NA
"My grandfather was a Democrat. He was a precinct committeeman that would drive you to the polls and give you whiskey out of his trunk after you voted. That's how it was in those days. I've always been a moderate. Leaning more to the right, for sure, but willing to listen and hear the other side. I find the Left today so far left I can't even make sense of it in my head. Yes, I voted for Ross Perot, because I believed he was what our country needed. And it split the Republican vote. I again voted my heart for Trump. Not because he was perfect, bit because he wasn't a politician and I believed that's what my country needed. I still believe that today.",1
"I’ve watched all your amazing posts since joining This group. You all are very inspiring ❤️When I was younger I considered myself more liberal. Then I had children and I really started looking at the issues. And I woke up!!! I would like to introduce my family we are a blended family we have five children together. The 2016 election brought my significant other and I together￼. We bonded over our middle of the road feelings on politics and too much￼government involvement￼. I posted something very peaceful the day after the election. I was blasted and told that I didn’t understand called names and threatened. ￼Both my parents are gone And I had a very toxic marriage that I had to leave.￼ I had done everything on my own for my kids and myself ￼ until Eddie and United. ￼￼ so I do understand what it’s like to struggle and I do understand what it’s like to only have myself to rely on. I’ve never taken government help. I have worked hard, sometimes several jobs. I feel it is my job as their mom to take care of them and make the best decisions for their futures..... not the governments job.￼￼ I cannot be open on my Facebook with who I support. I feel like I have to hide my true feelings constantly. I worry about losing my job if they know that I am a conservative. My guy is a hard worker and our kids are amazing. I am fighting for a future for them. I have a hard time with the double standard we’re living in. I have never seen a time in history when we cannot openly admit to who we support without fear of something bad happening. We are far from perfect but we are doing our best for our family. I didn’t have kids thinking the government would be in control I had kids because I wanted to raise future responsible adults that love their country and respect those who stand to keep us a Free country. As Americans we are very privileged and we can’t even see it. I see the privilege it is to be an American and I remind my kids daily of how lucky to live where we do. I pray those freedoms continue. Trump has my full support he cares about the American people and it’s clear as he has done all he said he would do if not more. Thank you for allowing me to share and God-bless our amazing country and all of you! I think the thing about America that’s most beautiful is the differences that we all have but being able to come together for the greater good.￼￼",0
When I was 18 I registered as a Republican. At the time I just chose the party not really having a reason. The first president I voted for was Ronald Reagan. I believed in him and his message. Since that time seeing the candidates the Democrats have chosen to run and listening to their rhetoric I now understand the choice I made at 18 really fits my beliefs. I am not far right. I am more in the middle between the middle and the right. However I know I definitely do not believe in the things the left pushes. I am a proud not rich Republican and I love having President Trump in office.,1
"Hello everyone. I’m Ashley, and I’m pretty sure this is my first ever “campaign” I’ve involved myself in... so that speaks volumes to how I view this movement. I’m a proud Christian, conservative, Pro-Life American (triple punch to the leftist side). I grew up in a republican household, but I truly understand now what it means to be a true Patriot in America. It’s not just a title, it’s a lifestyle I’m learning more and more about. I refuse to sit down and remain completely quiet as they want me to do. Because of my values, I have recently been called bigot, homophobic, xenophobic, “Karen”, and my favorite, I was told to “Go back to your KKK troop meeting” after I told someone I wouldn’t kneel for anyone except God. Well, I serve someone much higher and will continue to do so. God never promised a persecution-free life; I will continue to serve Him and speak truth. God Bless America, praying for our President!",1
"#WalkAway more like ran away. I also has a conservative mindset but grew up in Chicago voting Democrat. Last time I did that was when Obama ran the first time. Started seeing the do as we say mentality from the left, even talking to a liberal is so hard to do. I am a Assyrian, my family is from Iraq so I am first generation Assyrian-American. We are the indigenous people of Mesopotamia and Christian. We already seen the tearing down of status, taking over parts of cities, burning and defacing churches and buildings, their name was ISIS. This is exactly what I'm seeing from the left. NEVER GOING BACK!",0
"I have been a democratic my whole life, but I haven't really trusted the government or media for most of it. I've been studying things like MK-Ultra since I was a teenager. I only recently switched over to becoming a Trump supporter because I started actually researching what's going on in the world after COVID-19 hit. Now I have a much better understanding of what is happening in our world. Thanks for adding me.",0
"I'm a teacher, and aren't teachers always Democrats? I was, for many years. Socially aware of people in need, wanting to help when I can. About 10 years ago I started to wake up to the fact that the Democratic party was changing. Had changed drastically. That I had been changing along with it. An insidious cancer slowly growing and taking hold. I woke up and realized they now did not represent what I believed in. The change had been slow and I had followed along like a sheep. I have to say my husband opened my eyes and I have been a registered Republican and a conservative at heart ever since. My heart breaks for this country, MY country, OUR COUNTRY. We must take it back and educate. After all, that's what teachers do.",0
"I come from a long line of politicians from Robert Treat Paine to my paternal grandfather who was a republican house representative. I’ve always been a little rebellious so I refused to identify as either party. My grandfather died right before my 9th bday and later in life I realized I remember every word he ever said to me and most of it was political or related to politics in some way I didn’t understand at the time. I learned about the New World Order before I learned about Adam and Eve. Papaw always told me I would be the attorney and the politician in the family. I watched my aunt get so deep into what could possibly happen in our country (and world) at some point that she alienated everybody in her life and she rarely leaves her house. She lives in a world of fear, depression, and anger. I saw my dad going down a similar path but I was able to step in before it got too bad. I swore I wanted no part of politics. I have been silent about politics my entire life and refused to have a conversation about it. I always kept up with it though. In 2016 it became harder to be quiet. I had a life long friend that posted “if you support Trump just delete me,” so even though she had no idea who I voted for, I deleted her for the lack of her acceptance of free speech and choice. I also had a good friend that I worked with that was a hardcore Democrat. We were opposite in every way but we respected each other. When Trump won he missed a half day at work. He came in, went to the office of the owner of this large corporation (who is a huge Trump fan), said something very ugly about the election, and an hour later.... well let’s just say he was offered a comfortable severance to leave his 20yr job. I realized then the trend in attitudes from the Democrats I knew. I am the mother to 4 half black daughters so I am expected to think a certain way, my children are expected to think a certain way. We don’t!! I love my country to the point that I have a flag on my fridge so my boys can say the pledge every morning before we homeschool. I still cry every time I’m at a game and hear the National Anthem. Both of my grandfathers fought for our country. My dad fought for our country. I could keep this list going for a while. I have raised my daughters to value the opportunities being American has given us all. They have never liked being set apart. There was a group here that awarded black children every time they got a report card if they had certain grades. My girls got invitations every 9 weeks to come to the dinner they had for the kids and they would throw them away because “they didn’t want to be rewarded because of their skin color.” I always encouraged them to go if they wanted to. They will quickly tell you they don’t feel like they’ve had less opportunity or that their opportunities have been made more difficult than their white friends. They have a crap ton of student loan debt like everybody else, that doesn’t discriminate 😂. Have we had instances of racism, of course. My daughter was ostracized from a comp class in college after being told she “wasn’t black enough” because they didn’t like her more conservative views. I lived in a suburb (not a nice one) right outside Chicago and there we received more racism from the black community. We aren’t denying it exists, it’s just how we allow it to affect our lives, we don’t. This election period I have had to delete half of my friends on fb, some I’ve know my whole life. I’ve been told I’m a crappy mom and raised my kids “too white” 🤷‍♀️, I’m racist, I’m a bigot, I’m an embarrassment, I should be ashamed, I forced my children to think like me (not true at all. I’ve always encouraged they do their own research), etc. I’ve even been told my daughter who is pregnant is naming her baby a name that’s “too white,” she’s naming him after her dad. My 7yr old niece and I were in a store and I spoke to an acquaintance, the woman responded with “racist b****.” That’s how far this has gotten for me. This is not the country I want my grandchildren to be raised in. This isn’t what soldiers put their lives on the line for. After the realizations I had from the 2016 elections (I did vote for Trump) and everything that has happened during this one with my peers, the Democratic Party, BLM, ANTIFA, and the media, I can now say I am a die hard #walkwith republican!!! Trump/Pence 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",1
"I just want to say WELCOME! To anyone who decided to #walkaway from the disgusting, evil and vial Democratic Party. Weather you came to the conservative side or not I want to say welcome! You are now amongst people who will support you and defend you when that ugly nasty side shows their colors and attacks you. The free thinking side will always defend its flock!!! I know it took a lot of internal strength to walk away. I was raised blue collar democrat until my father and I both sat and said something is twisted and not right! When Obama came on scene! I lost a few life long friends and some family when I became more vocal about the wrong doings of the Democratic Party. You are safe here so thank you for my request #walkaway to be apart of this group and be a support system for some who may have lost it all walking away!",NA
Being 38 years old a union carpenter in chicago always told to vote Democrat never voted but I will be voting Republican and vote for the first time it's not about union anymore it's about what's best for the country and the people,NA
"Hello everyone! I'm a #WalkWith. All my life I have been a Republican Conservative. At first the news did not really appeal to me. However, when I started taking History and World History, I became more interested. For years I have been doing my research and never once voted Democrat. I almost did with Obama until I heard two words that gave me the most concern. Those words? ""Fundamentally Change."" Change yes, but to fundamentally change? That made me nervous. I voted against him both times. Trump wasn't even my first choice come 2016, Ben Carson was. I liked how he was soft spoken, intelligent, and worked on the front lines in medical care. However, when it came time to vote, I voted Trump. Digging more in to the Democratic party only left me more uneasy. I remembered back even before the Clintons when gun laws were starting to be put in place I felt it was a slippery slope. Some I agreed with, others, not so much. Now its just ridiculous. When they started with the ""political correctness"" I also knew that was going to be a very slippery slope. So forgive me if I'm not exactly politically correct. I have never had issues with the LGBT+ community, nor with the Black communities, or anything of that nature. Yet even though I treat others as I wanted to be treated, with dignity, respect, and an open mind, I was being called racist, homophobic, misogynist, and everything else you could possibly come up with. Thankfully through school, where even there I was severely bullied, it made me get a tough skin. Hardly anything offends me. I love a good debate, to discuss issues, to hear other points of views. As the culture grew worse and me being often times left to fend for myself against others, I had to ask ""why would I want to stop talking about my point of view?"" when it came to being off the clock at work in the break room? I couldn't believe I was told, ""don't talk about that"" when I brought up a valid point. Under Obama, I lost the healthcare that I had been with and liked to something I hated, and had to pay more for. I knew then things were only going to get worse. At first, it was little things. ""Say disabled instead of handicapped"". ""say African-American instead of Black."" ""This is now a gun-free zone"". I was grateful for the cop that came to the school, in fact I remember his name, Officer Burt. It was my first interaction with a cop outside of home when my father worked as a Corrections Officer in Washington State. He also taught Martial Arts and though he didn't have to, he taught me the simple punch which I will always be grateful for. Now to see those cops being belittled, defunded, disbanded, and more, I want to cringe. I want to say NO MORE. I wanted to give both sides in 2016 the opportunity to speak to me. It was there I met a gentleman at the rally, an older white man, and he was extremely enthusiastic. I asked where he came from, he said Texas. As we got to talking just a simple conversation about military, and such like that, he stated that he felt the Democrats had betrayed him. His words, not mine. I was so happy to see his enthusiasm and a group of us just started talking with him, in a welcoming, open way. We laughed, we joked, we talked serious issues, and we spoke of both sides of the aisle. Some anti-Trump people were there, and we let them be. The only thing we asked of them was to ""please put the American flag higher than the Hillary flag out of respect of the flag and those of us who have fought for your freedoms."" Simple request, and they did. We told them thank you and went on with conversation. It was a very contagious time. Then Secret Service came up to us in the line. I asked about those that served not as soldiers but also as First Responders? I had been a Firefighter for 6 years from 98 - 04. Nothing is ever really done for those that have been on the front lines here at home, but almost everything for those veterans that fought for our country. Do not get me wrong, my father was in in the Vietnam War so I appreciate the service of those brave people. However, I had run in to burning buildings, had to witness things most don't or are shielded from. So I had asked simply ""what about First Responders?"" The man nodded and said, ""I'll be right back"". When he returned, he pulled me, and the vets around me out of line and told us to go up to the front and checked the line for any others. We were literally taken 15 feet from our now President and told, ""If anything happens, you all are on our front line."" They gave us a briefing and we took it to heart. We had sworn the same oath after all, uphold the Constitution and defend it against all threats foreign and domestic. I have never been relieved of that oath. However, standing in front of President Trump, I listened to my gut. My gut told me that he was a decent man, no not perfect, but that he meant what he was saying. Hillary never shown up. I dug into her more, and the more I found, the more disgusted I was. I kept (truncated)",1
"I'm a lifelong conservative, grew up watching President Reagan run the country. I voted for President Trump the first go around and intend to do the same this time around. I just wanted to say I admire the folks that have walked away from the Democrat party.... Props to all the patriots and God bless America 🇺🇸",1
I was born in New York Puerto Rican parent I always lived in the project my teacher we're horrible I didn't know how to read until I was 10 I walkway from the left at 50 years old this year I had to catch up and educated my self on how great this country is🇵🇷🇨🇺🇺🇸💯💪🏽,NA
I love seeing all these stories. I grew up a Democrat and voted Democrat since i could vote (2000) was my first presidential vote. Late in the last term of Obama i started to see things i didn't see before that wasn't right with me. In 2016 i made up my mind. I was changing parties and i don't regret it one bit. I am proud of our president and what he has done and continues to do for our country.,0
"I was a democrat for several years and was in Obama's camp for eight years. I didn't like Hillary though and I didn't like Trump in 2016. I voted for Gary Johnson, a third-party candidate and it wasn't a wasted vote because Trump won the state of North Carolina by 173,000+ votes over Hillary. Well, I still don't like Trump but I am going to vote for him this time. Why? Because the 2018 mid-term election opened my eyes to the dangers of socialism taking over this country. We can't let Joe Biden win the election! I don't believe socialism will take over if Biden wins, but a Biden victory will bring us one step closer and make it easier for a socialist government to take over years from now. Right now I am more worried about democrats taking over both chambers of Congress than I am about Biden winning. I am still a liberal, but I will be voting Trump in November!",0
"I’ve been a member for a few months, but just decided to post after reading so many inspiring stories. I’m the product of two hard working immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who raised me to believe that Democrats were for the poor and Republicans were for the rich. It wasn’t until I was watching a (Hispanic network) with my mother one night where Trump was giving a speech and it was being translated to Spanish, I was shocked to see that what he was saying was not even close to what was being said in Spanish. Immediately, I turned to my mother and told her that they were not accurately translating what he was saying. Thereafter, I began listening to more of Trumps speeches watching Fox News and reading about republican policies. I began to see how much lies, hate and corruption the left stood for. This is when I realized how mistaken I was and that my beliefs completely aligned with those of Republicans. Fast forward, I’m proud to say my mother is now a Republican as well as my 18yr old daughter who just registered to vote this upcoming election. Lastly, I wanted to share that even though I was born in the USA when ever anyone would ask “what are you” I would say “Dominican” I guess I saw that as honoring my parents. However, since following Trump I’m overwhelmed by feelings of patriotism, honor and pride. Now when I’m asked that same question my answer is “I’m a proud American“ Thank you for your time, God bless you all",0
"I am not walking away as I have always been more conservative in my views, however I did not vote in the last 2 elections. After Bush ran, I was not impressed and was tired of hearing politicians make empty promises. I didn't like Obama and Romney's policies would have not sat well with me if he won. So I figured I didn't need to vote at all. Here comes Trump.. As I watch liberals make Trump the laughing stock and publicly humiliate him, degrade him, I felt a strong anger towards them for making fun Trump, who I didn't even know what he stood for and why he was running for president so I still didn't vote in 2016. But after seeing more and more hate towards him, and the lies he's exposing about them, I realized he really is working and helping the American people. I will be voting for him in November! #MAGA2020",1
"I wanted to share my #walkaway story in the hopes that others will be inspired to see the truth of their political affiliation for what it is, not just the façade with which we are provided. For some background, I’m a German/Polish/French Canadian-American. I also happen to fall under the LGBT+ umbrella. I pride myself in being bilingual, an active volunteer in my community, and acting as a big brother by mentoring physically and emotionally abused kids who lead childhoods similar to my own upbringing. I’ve spoken publicly on topics ranging from child abuse, sex workers, and adaptive-living strategies for people with mental and physical disabilities to vaccination efficacy, the importance of family wellness, and family planning. I started my life as a faithful Democrat. I never “chose” them as my party, per se – I just had been taught that to be a Republican meant you were generally racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. It had been drilled into me from day one that the people that supported the GOP were usually rich, old, white folks. They were portrayed as a group to hate; to fear, even. As such, I fell into leading a democratic-governed life. I even voted for HRC, as repulsive as I found her, simply because I could not stand DJT. The media made him out to be a sworn enemy to people like myself. In recent years, I’ve begun to question where I fall on the political spectrum. I used to classify myself as left-of-center, or “chaotic neutral”, as some call it. I just now know that I cannot continue to sit neutral while the radical left causes chaos. I cannot blindly support the ever-increasingly questionable tenets of the Democratic party. I cannot sit idly by while this country is destroyed from within. I support peaceful protest, but cannot condone rioting and looting. I support free speech for ALL, not just the far right or far left. I support the right to own and bear arms. I stand with the police. I stand for veterans. I stand for border control. I stand for each American to have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as declared by the Bill of Rights. I stand for America. I will no longer allow myself to be bullied into being far-left – because being a Democrat is no longer enough. They demand militant left, and nothing less. I will not stand for an America that does not represent me - and the Democratic party no longer represents me.",0
"My father was a Democrat, my mother a Republican. I saw myself more a Democrat when I was growing up. Growing up in the 60’s and 70’s, The Democratic Party represented the blue collar workers. As time went on...the Democratic Party started going further left I identify as an Independent. While I did not vote for Obama the first time, I thought , well maybe he will do some good. So, I gave him a chance. I was disappointed to say the least. Obama winning the White House the 2nd time was my turning point. I saw him as a threat to America and the freedoms we so cherished. The freedoms that many of our soldiers defended and died for over the years. I saw him dividing us and turning us against each other. As Americas first black president he had the opportunity to mend the racial divisions of the past and he failed… eight years and he only made things worse. I saw him apologizing to other countries for our actions, I saw him defending criminals over our police officers. I saw him doing nothing to protect our borders, allowing illegals to come into our country without taking the proper trajectory. I saw my 401(k) losing funds and our economy sinking fast. I saw him take from our military and weaken our countries sovereignty. The list goes on and on. It was obvious he was putting America last. I knew our country was in trouble, The democratic party has gone rogue and we needed someone to step up to the plate and put America first. I prayed that this would happen. In June 2015, my prayers were answered. Successful businessman, Donald J Trump announced his run for President of the United States of America as a Republican. Right from the start I knew he was the right man for the job. His no nonsense, tough and confident attitude was just what American needed to bring us back to the front of the line. A businessman is just what we needed. Donald J Trump was always a patriot who loved our country. I believed in him and his ability to make a difference for the American people. This is when I changed my political affiliation to Republican and have not looked back ever since. We need President Trump to win another 4 years. Our country depends on it. There is only one choice for America.. #Trump2020!",0

"I was a Dem since I first voted in 1976. I voted for Obama twice. In his second term when he flew the cash planes to Iran, when he slowly disrespected Cops and the Military a little at a time, when he told the Russians he could be more flexible after the election, when he gave more money and clout to foreign nations and made apologies when there was nothing to apologize for. I walked. When Pelosi and Schumer made JFK look like a conservative, when They voted AOC into office. I walked. I thought I could never be a Republican but I am Proud to stand up for the Red White and Blue. God bless America and save America from this leftist attack on our Nation.",0
"Where do I begin? I voted for Trump, not because I really liked him very much, but because I am a Christ Follower. I cannot and will not vote for a Democrat. It goes against everything I believe in. Is Trump harsh and crass at times? Absolutely. Does he have a bit of an ego? For sure. Do I believe that he loves this country ? I do. My eyes began to really open when Covid came on the scene. Came right on the heels of the impeachment. I started “ connecting the dots” if you will. So much started making sense. Trump was responsible for every bad thing in America. Somehow, he was supposed to become a doctor overnight in order to control this virus . Somehow, racism was all his fault too. Along with all Republicans. Was there anything GOOD at all that this man had done in almost four years of service to our country? According to the media, there wasn’t. He does not take a salary. He puts up with more than any other US President has ever had to. He wants to protect our borders. He wants only LEGAL citizens to receive benefits in America. He had a booming economy.. until Dems had other plans to destroy it. Why? To bring him down. Doesn’t matter to them who suffers as a result. Who goes hungry, who loses their home, whose business closes. That is evil, plain and simple. People who would be willing to watch fellow Americans suffer in order to bring down a President they hate. And why do they hate him? Because he cannot be bought, persuaded, or bamboozled. He knows who is in the swamp, and he knows how to drain it. They despise that. It’s no longer “business as usual”. He is not a politician nor will he play politics. I am a proud Republican. I will gladly vote for Trump in 2020. This time, I will vote for him because I DO believe in him. I am so happy my eyes are open! I want to see him make America Great Again! I love reading all the Walk Away stories. They inspire me and bless me beyond measure. It’s time for the Silent Majority to be heard! Trump 2020.",1
"So glad I found this group! I love reading the stories from others. Like many of you, I grew up in a very Democratic family.

"Hi. I am #walkwith that is 36 year old father with a family of five with two working parents. Not much to say so I will be short. I thank God I was fortunate enough to have a family that taught me the importance of the 3 inalienable rights this great country guarentees. Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness and was also taught the 2 ""Fs"" (as my dad called it) Family and Freedom. But I have to admit I was beginning to be discouraged by what I was seeing happen to the US. Being invited and accepted in has put my soul at ease. The stories I have seen on here are so inspiring and has given me such a calming feeling knowing that there are others that are in the fight of our lives with me. Much respect to everybody in here with the courage to confront cancel culture and the ideologs of the left, and truly care and appreciate this wonderful country.

"#WalkWith So happy to be invited to such a wonderful page and to see the love and support! I am a first generation American. My parents are immigrants from Germany. They met here in the states. My birth father(that’s the nicest name I will give him) became a citizen as a young boy. My amazing Mom did not become a citizen until 2005 (she moved here as a teenager). Politics was not a topic growing up in my household as a youngster (i am the youngest out of 4). My mom couldn’t vote and my birth father was a felon and couldn’t vote either. Fast forward to when I was 12 and my mom got remarried (still thank god for him 30 years later). My first introduction to politics came from MY Dad 🤩. My mom was open to talking politics but only about structure of the government and major topics . But she was admit about just the topic . She made sure my father did not “sway” me one way or the other. It was MY job to choose what I believed in and willing to fight for #amazigparents After 9/11 my mother had a hard time traveling out of the country with her German passport. Although she would do these trips 4 to 5 times a year for work, it now became a hassle for her . Being held in customs for hours , searched etc . She had enough. She had lived in this country for 40 years , owned homes , paid taxes , owned a business and said it was time for her voice to be heard. She did it , and became a citizen in July of 2005. We threw a huge party and celebrated her new voice. Fast forward to now. My parents are so amazing (I can never say it enough) and are always open to dialect . My Dad , like myself is a Republican and as our conversations got deeper my Mom was listening and as of 3 years ago changed from a Democratic vote to Republican vote. Her heart and God has lead her to what her real passions are now and all the lessons she taught me as child. I have been a Republican since I first registered to Vote. It will NOT change. I now have an 18 year old son and this is first election ... and just like my parents, I lead him To topics and how the government works. However , I leave it to God to lead him to his choice . He is listening !!! Please make sure you have conversations with your children . Do not force your opinion on them ... I promise you they WILL watch your actions , they WILL judge your heart. Be the example to them like my parents were to me . God bless you ALL ! Trump 2020!!!",1

"Gosh, I love these stories. And I love these HEARTS! People are good.. the devil divides. I was a very soft #walkwith I suppose. I voted for Trump in 2016 because my husband told me to. I was always begging him to not get into political talks and hide his Trump pride because I didn’t want anyone to be upset. I wanted to show I was a tolerant Christian. The lockdown had me creeping social media and I found a friend sharing WWG1WGA so I fell down the rabbit hole. Now I’m more vocal than my husband. I am so proud of our President and I admire his strength and tenacity to fight the good fight for us. Team, you are not alone. We love big. We will unite.

"Hi. My name is Kelli. I have my niece in the first picture, and my youngest granddaughter in the second. This is my #walkaway story. I am a lifelong republican. I come from a family of them. I never really thought about it much, really. Just vote for who you like. Until yesterday. I had a democratic friend who was actually voted into the NC House of Representatives a few years ago. He was only there 1 term, but when he was elected, I congratulated him because he was a friend. I had went to school with him. Yesterday, I had put up a post about Trump agreeing with Dr. Stella. It wasn't a big deal to me. I have posted a lot of Trump supporting posts. This ""friend"" literally told me to go inject myself with clorox on this post. I responded that I was praying to God that he wasn't referring to me. He was. Mind you, I am a 3 time suicide survivor. He is basically telling me to go kill myself. This is why I will never vote Democrat.",1
"I love the stories I read here so decided to share mine. I am embarrassed of part of it. The post will be a little long and a bit off-topic to explain my situation. I grew up in a hardcore democrat family. I was told that the democrats are for poor people, which my family was, and the republicans were only for the rich. I believed that to be true, why would my family lie. I voted democrat in every election up to Obama. I knew there was something about him I didn't like. He talked too slick and smooth. He was like a great used car salesman about to sell you a lemon. I did some research and did not like his record as a senator. I did not vote in 2008. This is where I go off topic a bit, but it is important. In 2010 my wife left me and took my kids. She could not cope with my job which was 24/7 and caused me to be a miserable person. I fell into a deep depression and, long story short, went into a downward spiral that ended with me being a heroin addict. I robbed 2 cab drivers in one day for drug money. The next morning I felt so much guilt and disgust in myself that I went to my family and got clean, cold turkey. I turned myself in for my crimes, admitted everything, and accepted my 7 year sentence (served 6 from 2012 through 2018) like a man. I value the time I spent incarcerated because I used it to educate myself. I was in a program called NJ STEP which is a college program. I had professors from Rutgers and Princeton and carried a 4.0 GPA. I started reading a lot about politics and was surprised at what I had discovered. The democrats are not for poor people. Their policies are meant to keep us in our place. There is no room for advancement. With their ever increasing socialist views it is getting worse. They want to tell us what we can have, when we can have it, and how we can use it. They want to enslave us, which is no surprise from the party of slavery. I saw that the republican party has policies that, while on the surface seem anti-poor, are actually policies to help us lift ourselves up. Work hard and succeed. I fell in love with then candidate Trump's campaign and his messages. he was and is all about America first. Something the democrats are far from. I din't get to vote for our great president in 2016.I did vote for him in the primary in NJ. It was so great voting again. I believe it is among our greatest freedoms. I cannot wait to vote for him in the general election this November. I do fear that they are going to force mail in voting to try and steal the election. We all must stand up against that and demand that it does not happen. Lastly, while I am definitely no longer a democrat and will never vote for a democrat again, I do not consider myself a republican. I am an American that believes in the US Constitution and will always vote for the candidate that best represents that. God bless all of you and God bless America.",0
"You might have a similar story, but here is mine. Our family was dirt poor, my folks grew up in the dirty 30's, farmers in rural South Dakota. They learned a hard work ethic from their parents who also were farmers. My Father was conservative. My Mother grew up in a very strong Democratic family who all were very close. My Mother's closest sister my Aunt Marion was Democratic Chairwoman in Clark County Nevada. She also worked for Senator Howard Cannon in Nevada. She was married to my Uncle Paul and he was well connected in Las Vegas. They were very well off and of course huge supporters of the Kennedy family and knew them personally. That being said, I was born with the initials JFK, yet it was before the nation really knew who he was. But studying his life, I quickly became a fond follower as did most of the nation of who JFK was. In my early teens I was the founder of the Young Democrats in our county. Attended many conventions, and worked campaign staffs for Sen George McGovern, Sen Jim Abourzek, Governor race for William Dourghty, I was pretty well entrenched in the Democratic Party. I always had a deep respect for Seniors and their life stories, history, and I remember a great conversation I had one day with a elderly man who I deeply respected. He shared many thoughts of why that someday I would leave the Democratic Party. Actually I thought this guy had lost his mind because there was NO WAY I would ever leave the Democratic Party. I hated Republicans. I considered them snobish rich people who were not anything like me. But after the years went by, in my early adult life I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. Over time things really changed with me as I grew in the Lord and asked Him for guidance in my life, for wisdom as a Father, Christian, Man, Husband, He did just what I prayed and asked for. The first thing He did was to open my eyes on the subject of Abortion. Now I have to say I considered Abortion off the table discussion. My Sister had one and it was deeply a NO TALK subject around our family. But it was not just Abortion, it became next our Nations Defense and I observed just how Democratic administrations say from 80's on really did not do much or hurt our military. Now I admit, I voted for Jimmy Carter the 1st time but I did not vote for him the 2nd time nor did I ever vote for a Democrat again. I heard a ABC news reporter ask President Reagan ""Why did you leave the Democratic Party"" The President replied: ""I never left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me"". Bingo! That was exactly how I had felt over time. The Democrats have continuously moved away from just about every position I believed in my heart. The platforms at conventions continued to me seemingly were anti-God, anti-American and to this day it continues on. The very last Democratic hopeful I would have even considered supporting for was former Asst Sec of Defense and US Senator Jim Webb (former US Combat Marine) and the Democrats ran him out on the rail because he does not fit their liberal, extremest ideals. No, sadly the Democratic party is NOT the party of my Grandmother, nor my Mother who were HST Democrats. That party is long gone. And so am I. Like President Regan, I never left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me. BTW One thing my Mother always did say. You don't vote for the Party you vote for the person who is best qualified for the job. She had a LOT of wisdom. I promise you this, if she were alive today she would say TRUMP 2020",0
"I have loved following this page for the last few weeks . Sadly im 41 years old and a natural born citizen who refused to vote. The reason was I just felt I wasnt educated enough to make a right decision for me. I was never pressured as to what side I should be rallying for . My father was/is a hard worker his entire life and made sure he always did the right thing . To this day i still have no clue who he sides with. But I know he chooses to live the American dream. I remember sitting in a restaurant when Obama was elected and was ecstatic that we finally had a black president. I thought to myself, ""how amazing "". And again not knowing which side Obama was even on 🤦‍♀️ . I was just hoping for the country that this would mean a big change . Bring us to 2016 I was super happy Trump won , I could care less about what the media said, i was amazed how much he LOVED America, that I became fascinated. I thought, hes exactly what this country needs, no B.S. and all for us !! So I registered hoping my vote will finally stand for something ... #walkwith #trump2020",NA
"Hello, everyone! Thanks for the add! I have always walked with, but never really got into politics until Trump ran. after the last 3 1/2 years and especially the past 7 months, I have read so much, trying to figure out what’s true and what’s false. I absolutely know I’m on the right side. I’m very worried about our country, I have read several post on here and it gives me hope.",NA
So excited to have attended my first Republican Rally on Saturday! Peace ❤️ Love 🤍 Hope 💙 Inspiration #walkaway #Trump2020 🇺🇸,NA
"🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Growing up in the South and with a single parent raising me. My dad died when I was 20 months old. My brother was eleven years older than me so as a single parent in 1947 it was a really heavy burden on her. Of course being from the south we were always democrats. I went to work when I was 14 years old. My brother joined the Army when I was 8 years old. It wasn't an easy life but we made the best out of it. I married my husband in 1965 and we just celebrated 55 years of marriage. He has probably always been a conservative and has voted Republican for years. I was still old school as my mother loved Jimmy Carter, because we lived in Georgia and I voted for him. Just last year I heard my husband talking to our oldest son and my husband told my son that for many years that each time we voted we cancelled out our vote because he voted Republican and I voted Democrat. I woke up somewhere down the line because I did vote for Bush. But when I really woke up is when I didn't vote for Obama for either terms!! That is when I got really angry to see what Obama was trying to do to the USA!! It was appalling to me that one could be a POTUS and hate the USA and the American people at the same time. The more I researched the more angry I became!! I guess you could call me an independent before this wake up call because I always voted with my heart. The Democratic party of today is NOT the Democratic party I grew up with. These Democrats are nothing but evil and my heart does not support evil to any extent!! Thank you Diane Holland for inviting me to this group!! Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",0
"Hey there, I was a Democrat growing up, I really didn't know who my parents voted for as we never talked politics. I was raised Catholic taught to respect our elders and neighbors and those we didn't even know. Give a nod or hey if you made any kind of eye contact in passing. Fast forward to Bush vs. Dukakis I was full in for Dukakis had the Lick Bush t-shirt the whole bit. Voted for him even voted for Clinton. Until the PMRC came about. Tipper was and accomplished censorship of musians. Those labels are censorship. This is when I first started figuring out their lies.its ok if I do this but not you. Those double standards. In 2005 I met my future wife she was a Christian and brought back to Christianity, I had left catholic church behind years ago but still went to mass with my parents. Anyway this is where I started reading about being a good steward. The left will always demand every single person to save the planet. Few actually do anything about it. I learned that more Christians really care about the world and not in some crazy we need to get rid of oil way. But in a silent way, just picking up after oneself and others. I also learned that its not our jobs to condem others that break the laws we are to leave that to the authorities, we are to love one another as our own. And forgiveness oh such a powerful tool from God along with his grace. I have seen this country go from segregation to we are all one back to labeling everyone back to segregation. That is what the left has and still is doing. They want the labels that way they can keep us separated and controlled. Peace be with y'all.",0
"Hi everyone! So glad this page is here. Ive always been a conservative but up until the last 3 years I never really bothered with following any politics as they had never seemed to affect me. Watching what is happening in this country due to the radical left is horrific. I don't think I could name a more hypocritical, deceitful, greedy, bigoted, corrupt.... the list could go on and on.... group. I don't see how people can just follow blindly to what the media and ""news"" portrays, but I hope more and more people will wake up and #walkaway. Trump 2020!",NA
"I am a #walkwith lifelong Conservative Republican and feel very grateful to be here on this platform with all of you.

Please continue to stand strong, fight this good fight and spread the word. Hard hearts are being softened and broken hearts are being healed one courageous person at a time.

My name is Donna Williams: I am a part of that silent majority. First President I voted for was Ronald Reagan and the last President I voted for was Donald J Trump. I love the liberty we have here in America and I cherish my freedom. I'm enjoying reading the post on here that you guys are posting. And thank you for adding me to the group.,NA
"I honestly love reading these stories. So many of you have such amazing stories to tell. And your courage is recognized. This group is made up of so many diversities. Yet, we all have one common goal. And that is to save our Country. This group has shown me what America can and should be like. All different but we have respect for one another as a human beings. My story is simple. I never claimed to be affiliated with any party. I actually thought politics were just stupid and annoying. It was not until Obama became President that I started waking up. I could just not get on board with him. It seemed he was causing more division than Unity. I tolerated him for 8 years. Then when I seen that Hillary was running. I picked up my head and said. NO! This Woman scared me to no ends. I had already done research on her. She just could not win. So, I went and finally registered to Vote. And indeed voted for President Trump. But even I was very skeptical in him winning. When Trump claimed Victory. I knew then our lives were going to change forever. The left who once supported and liked Trump as a business man. Had turned on him completely. The question I had then was why? So I started digging. And found out a lot and why it is so detrimental that he win in 2020. We as the People have got to stand together. We are in a war, a war to save our Freedom. I feel very blessed to be able to read all of your stories. You all give me hope! You all give America Hope. God Bless 🇺🇸🇺🇸",0
"When I met Mark Nelams over a year ago, he was an avid sports watcher. Never even watched a local news show. I was raised in an independent household which leaned towards the right but my mother many times voted against who my father voted for. We were taught to think for ourselves. Me personally considered myself as independent and not follow any party. Then met Mark, who could tell you who the president was but not much more. I encouraged him to watch a little of CNN and FOX NEWS. I did not know what I was doing at the time but felt everyone should know what is going on in our country. Well, I created a MONSTER 😃. It only took a couple of days for him to get interested and now we watch Fox news 24/7. I am not lying. He gets out of bed and immediately turns on Fox. We got married 6 weeks ago and he works the 3pm to 12 shift. Every single show is now recorded and we watch them when he gets home. Every so often I will set my foot down and he will watch an ID show. Anyway, my husband registered to vote for the first time in his 52 years! He loves Trump, as do I, and I can't wait to go with him for his first time. He has lost friends because he talks Trump all day long. Thanks for accepting us in this group. #Trump2020",0
"This is my second post, i walked away in 2010 with the help of my grandfather, Rush Limbaugh, and the John and Ken show (who are nominated for the radio hall of fame, please vote they are the voices of reason here in Los Angeles). I just had to say it is so flipping uplifting to read your posts. Here in southern California I'm surrounded by insanity, when i go on social media i feel like I'm going crazy because of the ignorance on display. Turn on the tv and what do i get? More craziness. I've always loved sports, they were such a good escape from the struggles of life and now i feel like a member of the kkk when i watch a basketball game. I hate being a Lakers fan knowing our star is a Chinese shill. But again, i turn on Rush, i read your stories and i am reminded that there is still sanity left. I'm including a picture of my son, he's a rainbow baby about to be 8 months old. He is already told daily that gov't is not the solution, it is the problem. He knows the media is a bunch of commie hacks. That he will be able to run his life better than some jackass in Washington and that commies aren't real people. Kind of kidding about the last one. Anyway i love you all, keep spreading the love and if you're shy about sharing don't be, this community is very welcoming.",0
Well this group is giving me hope that maybe it’s not too late. The news is depressing and I’m seriously worried what will happen in November. I have been stressed about it for some time. But reading through just a few of the posts here has lightened my heart. We may still be able to save our wonderful country!! God bless and invite all your friends! 😊❤️ #Trump 2020 #MAGAAgain #KAG,NA
"The Rescue America Rally #WalkAwayCalifornia yesterday in Sacramento at the State Capital was amazing! So many great photos and videos from the rally have already been posted. Here are a couple from before the rally, 8:00 am! Volunteers (haha, not too many in these pictures). They were busy doing what they do best to put something like this on. Some fun dancing to pass the time by the little ones who came out to help their parents! At the end of the day, the turnout was spectacular, growing bigger and larger with each Rally. Brandon Straka knows how to draw a crowd.",NA
"My husband (a black man) respects my right to my own opinions. He told me this afternoon that many people expect me to be a Dem because he is black and my children are biracial 🙄 I told him that my beliefs have nothing to do with race, SMH. He acknowledged that he knows that, but others don’t get it (apparently some of those others have made comments to him). My husband and I try to understand where the others are coming from and have always agreed to disagree. It’s a shame others cant do the same. In the end, I told him I couldn’t care less what anyone else thinks and I don’t have to justify my beliefs to anyone. I had a longtime friend question why my husband and I are still FB friends with with a very conservative relative of hers. My husband was a lot more diplomatic that I woud have been, and he shut her down quickly. Although we have different beliefs, we are both very tolerate.",NA
"Thank you for accepting me into this group! All members of this group are amazing people and I feel blessed to get to know you through your stories. I have voted Republican since Ronald Reagan after seeing the light! My husband, grown children, father, sister, are all Republican! I wanted to join this group to walk with all of you on the road to victory in November!",NA
"I’ve been a conservative since I was about 16 years old. I was in a speech and debat class that required me to research both sides of an arguement so as to be prepared to defend either side. In this class I debated issues like abortion, criminal justice, death penalty, welfare and social programs, civil rights and more. Investigating both sides of an argument it became very clear to me that I was a conservative. Since then I joined the local young republicans and worked on many campaigns: local, state, and Presidential. I grew up in California and was always surprised at how often I would have discussions with people who believed they were a democrat yet held conservative beliefs. Most people over the years that I have debated political issues were not well informed on either side of the argument and in fact often argued by emotion. When I would present facts they could not dispute, I was called a racist, bigot, or told I only care for the rich. I grew up poor, have grown up in a heavily integrated community and have always had friends of all races, I am in an interracial marriage, many of my closest friends are gay. The name calling and overly emotional responses always shut down intelligent conversations. Over the years it seems to have gotten worse. Many of the social issues plaguing our country today are manufactured to create victims who feel perpetually offended. As soon as the rest of us get used to the new “newspeak” acceptable to debate these issues, they change it again and conservatives find themselves playing catch up to even be part of the discussion. This is by design so that we always seem to be out of touch and intolerant. I am filled with so much hope to see so many stories of great Americans that the Democrat party has lied to and made to feel like a marginalized victim wake up and realize that the conservatives are the ones actively fighting for your rights and freedoms. I want to encourage all of you to keep having the scary conversations, investigate both sides of these issues, and never debate out of anger. Thoughtfulness will win many more to our side and we are THE SILENT MAJORITY!! I #walkwith all of you and thank you for your vulnerability in sharing your stories. Bless you all! ❤️🇺🇸",1
Hello! Thanks for the add! Alot of these stories from members I can relate to! I was born and raised in Oregon. I am a mother of 3 and a fiancé. My Family is not very political so growing up I had no clue about politics. I chose Democrat as I got older because hearing what promises they had to offer to help people and what not sounded good! The republicans were the bad guys. I voted for Obama his first election. Then I voted for Bernie. These last few years with Trump in office has opened my eyes for the better! I recently changed my voters card and will be voting Trump this election! This whole quarantine has given me plenty of time to do a lot of research as well and learn more and more! I’m thankful God opened my ears and heart to change! Have a blessed day! 🇺🇸,0
"So where do I start? I was raised with my father and all his brothers being vets, come from that side of the family mainly Christian vets. However then you have the others side and one offs, they really had no values or morals, yet always felt they were owed something from everyone else. I also grew up in a heavy democratic state NM. While my dad was a vet he was also a ""hippie"". Talk about confused trying to figure it all out 🤣. My dad always taught me and all of us kids to ALWaYS make my own mind up, look into things for yourselves. While I knew he was registered republican, he didn't fall into the typical view people try to make them out to be. When it was time to register I tried to refused to "" either"" party I registered independent. Once I meet and married my husband who was a very outspoken republican and a pastors kid I was tired of not having an option in the primary elections, so I changed to republican. We have grown over the years and I finally have made my husband realize that we are more ""libertarian"" then falling in line with a 2 party system. We are both registered republicans, however did not vote Trump in 16 we did and do really like Johnson.( This did not make my father in law happy🤣) However after this 4 years we may not agree with his methods and the way he says things at times, we both will be voting Trump this 2020! People do not realize that it has been the tantrum throwing, rude, and awful way they treat people that make us know there is no way to vote Dem. I honestly feel bad and pray for people who believe they are helping by being Dem. Sorry I don't really have photos of myself they are off mostly my kids and or dogs, so it's a bad photo, but it's one.",1
"I just wanted to introduce myself with this post. Growing up I never really stopped to think about political issues. I was from a rural part of Texas north of Dallas ~75 miles near the Texas/Oklahoma border. I graduated high school in a class of 51 where one of those students was my identical twin. I then moved to New York City to pursue a modeling career as a way to pay for college with aspirations to attend law school. No one could help me pay for school. I had divorced parents who had jobs, but we were never rich. School was my responsibility. I thought I wanted to be a real estate attorney, however, halfway through my junior year at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, TX, I was out with friends the Saturday night of Easter Sunday in 2005 when I was 22 years old. We were drunk so I didn’t drive, but I never considered the consequences of being a passenger with my friend who was 3 times the legal limit. We were headed home after the bar closed for the night not 5 minutes from my apartment. It was a really rainy night, and the truck hydroplaned. The truck spun, and we came to a halt when we slid into a tree directly where I was sitting. My friend was driving his single-cab half ton truck with a bench seat, and I was seated shotgun. There was another friend with us in the middle as well. My body had no where to go so basically my entire right side of my body was fractured, and I suffered a very severe traumatic brain injury along with numerous internal injuries. I emerged from a 39 day coma unable to talk or walk. I spent 10 years in a power wheelchair, and progressed to using a big walker now. I’m still unable to talk, but I have a good career as a public speaker. Yes, your eyes weren’t deceiving you. I’m a non-talking public speaker. I “speak” by typing into an iPad app that speaks what I type. My Mom and I both speak about the events that led to my situation and about alcohol awareness. Mainly at high schools, but we have speeches for other ages and various venues, including my faith journey as well. Obviously, the faith speeches aren’t given in public schools. I’m not opposed to talking about God in public schools, but we know that a career doing that wouldn’t last more than a day or two! I was on social security disability for a number of years because I had no way to earn a living. My Mom had to quit her job to care for me. My Mom and I then began speaking after she realized how cognitively intact I still was. My doctors from those days couldn’t believe that either, after sustaining a traumatic brain injury so severe. I attribute that to God! My Mom and I started a nonprofit to support our speaking that we earn a small salary from in addition to providing scholarships to other traumatic brain injury survivors to attend camps for adult survivors. Consequently, I was earning enough to give up social security disability. We have much bigger plans for the nonprofit, but I won’t get into those. I know many people legitimately need their social security disability, and I always will if I’m unable to continue doing what I do, however, by the grace of God we have managed to stay afloat during this “pandemic”. We are doing presentations virtually while unable to go into schools. We’re hoping a vaccine is found soon, and everyone can resume their normal life. I’ve heard many times about a “new normal” but living in isolation isn’t living. I believe we will return to the lives we all are accustomed to. I trust that God will take care of us, but even if it’s my time to leave this body, I know where I’m going. Until that time comes, I believe that Donald Trump is going to lead the country to the best outcome for us to live a good life. Through the Obama term, I realized I am certainly a Conservative. While just having Republican attached to a name doesn’t by default make them good, I know my values are totally opposite from the progressive/liberal set of values. I was a skeptic the last election because I worried Trump could have just been saying what we wanted to hear, but there was no possible way I would vote for Clinton! I’ve seen all the good Trump has done, and I’m now a true believer!",0
"Hello everyone, I’m so incredibly thrilled to be here! I’m Deborah Sweazey, Im 63 live in NE Florida.

"Thanks for adding me! It can be hard to stand up to family. We were raised republican, but; a brother went to University, got a PhD in education and well, you can guess the rest of the story.

"i don’t even know where to begin with this. i’ve been a voting democrat for the past 30 years. and like so many of the other stories i have read here, i believed that the democrat party was the party for the people. as an empath, animal lover and someone who has always carried the weight of the world on her shoulders, justice, peace, loving-kindness and equanimity have always been priority number one for me. but i also believe strongly in personal and societal integrity. need i say more? i’ll paraphrase, but the real unraveling for me was watching the kavanaugh/blasey-ford sham hearings and the trial by public opinion that failed to look forward at how this would harm our nation and legal foundation of due process. i remember pointing this out to friends on the left who thought i was not “getting it” and that i should “stand with women” and “stand up for women’s right to choose” and not to worry about how things were actually handled and the people’s lives that the democrats were attempting to destroy in order to win a ""victory"" over trump. i had and have great empathy for both kavanaugh and blasey-ford and thought they were both used and abused in that situation. and then there was tara reid and the left was silent... there have been countless other situations since, but the #metoo hypocrisy and denying that antifa exists or is “not actually a fascist group because the name means ‘anti-fascist’ “ were major turning points for me. i am a media educator and content creator and i know all too well how important framing and editing are in order to convey a message in a way that creates a desired response. i have taught a great number of students over the years about the kind of power that rests in the hands of the editor and that ultimately, what we do is manipulate emotions and the perception of reality. i use the word manipulate in a neutral way; it is what it is. but when done specifically to create harm or to create division, i believe this is a power that is tremendously toxic and harmful to the well-being of all people. what i have seen over the past few years within the mainstream media which fundamentally supports establishment candidates and politicians while denigrating and smearing those who speak up for truth and justice is truly abominable. and what i have also learned over this time is that the masses and the mob are all too quick to judge based on their emotions, without knowing actual facts. the way tulsi gabbard, a patriot, major in the national guard and woman of great integrity who lives in service to this nation was treated both by the DNC and MSM starting with hillary clinton’s smear tactic of calling her a “russian asset” and the systemic erasure of her voice was the last straw for me. how could a party that professes to support women, people of color and democracy bury alive the one remaining woman of color who was still in the race yet excluded from speaking? and so few people even knew she was still in the race until she dropped out after covid hit because the establishment tried to erase her. this also made me start a deep dive, looking at the source of all information whenever possible instead of relying on MSM to interpret the “facts”. i now have really thoughtful conversations with friends and family who have been behind trump since 2016 and watch daily press briefings and round tables from the white house as well as tune in to the house and senate hearings whenever i can so that i can see the actual policies and thoughts behind them rather than the smeared interpretation and projection from the left. i am beginning to see that trump, like tulsi, has been treated very unfairly and that so much of what the left is going on about is indeed based on “fake news”. the rioting in the streets and the failure for our elected leaders to stand up to criminal behavior of all kinds in the name of the BLM protests as countless communities were burned and looted and poor people of color and law enforcement were maimed or killed in the name of “anti-violence” was just icing on the hypocrisy-cake for me. it seems that whenever i raise these issues with friends on the left i am ignored or gaslit. they are so overwhelmed with TDS that they cannot see right from wrong anymore. it is distressing but i continue to have hope that some will begin, as i did, to listen to the truth... so i’m here because i no longer recognize the democrat party as a party for the people and i will always stand by and for the american people above political party. we are a troubled and flawed nation in many ways, but i believe this nation is built from a collective-heart that is pure and strong and that we will rise above the chaos and destruction and emerge a better people as a result. i hope and i pray that we will continue to work on healing the divisions by coming together in all areas of our lives and that we will model this on love, forgiveness and (truncated)",0
"Politics was never something I cared about in the least. I was always a person that was you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. Then Trump ran for election and I was like maybe he could do some good because he doesn't need investors that can control his office like other politicians. I thought he was loud and obnoxious but he used the media to save himself 25 million dollars in campaign dollars. The media lives to demonize him but they insist on digging up and making controversies out of nothing. The comments he made about women while they were brash and rude, I even asked my husband if that would be something he would say in group of guys. Yes.... it gets said, and who cares what the mans life is outside politics. People want an outside life beyond their jobs right, do you want your job meddle in? Anyways, once COVID happened I started seeing liberal media have a hayday on Trump and they literally pulled a person who cared nothing about voting and was willing to go with the flow to a true Trump supporter who can't wait to show my support on Election day!",0
"Hi Friends, excited that my friend invited me as I too was a liberal allll my life until earlier this year. I even volunteered for a day on Obama’s campaign the first time I was able to vote when I legally became a Citizen. In 2016 even as a liberal I was fascinated by Trump (at first) but couldn’t stand the way he treated people and the reporters so I was super torn ON Election Day. A strong liberal I just voted for Hillary thinking it would be awesome to have a woman in power. I heard the rumors and scandals of misuse of the Haiti earthquake relief funds but at that time I chose not to look into it. I hate to say it but I somehow felt the Democrats were naturally the smarter more superior option automatically, like choosing the other side was NOT even an option. Ever! I was dating a guy who was a super Trump fan. I HATED the fact that he seemed to adore Trump. He always had negative stuff to say about Obama and the Clinton’s and I didn’t want to hear it. After all I really wasn’t into politics so I didn’t understand why he kept bringing politics into the relationship so I’d let it go in one ear and out the other and after we broke up I put on my dating profiles that I was NOT interested in anyone who was a Trump Fan.....fast forward to today and someone literally called ME a “Trumpist”!!! This same “now” friend of mine forwarded me something about “Pizzagate” recently and this was the start down my rabbit hole. I also saw something in my boss’s email (which I have access to 24hrs a day) which was a video about the Fall of the Cabal. I was shocked that someone was sending her something about this but now I really had to start questioning everything!! When the Virus first started I was posting often informing my friends and making sure they were safe and had all the information but then the conspiracy theories started coming out and I went down those rabbit holes as well. The plan for a #NWO is evident and I have been sharing like crazy!! Because I like to share info I Soon lost my BFF in my home country as well as the Acapella group I was a part of. I became a target of cyber bullying and They started calling me racist and white privileged and ugly and all sorts. Not only that, other people, friends and people I didn’t even know started attacking my posts. I was shocked that Democrats/liberals were treating me this was for having NON-Liberal views!! I never treated my republican friends this way and I have MANY! And all of a sudden I became ASHAMED That I was ever a Democrat. Watching liberal’s thirst for power over these last few months has made me ashamed that I was ever a democrat and grateful and I opened my eyes and ears to the information available and being shared to the truth about what is really going on!! Im glad I Walked Away and I am doing everything In my power to help others #WalkAway too.",0
"PLEASE SHARE!!! I am voting for President Trump in November and I hope that many more will #WalkAway from the Democratic Party - the party that walked away from its own people. First and foremost, President Donald J. Trump is a President for all people, but especially American citizens. His “Buy American, Hire American” executive order puts American workers first and encourages a strong economy and low unemployment rate. Just prior to the virus, the US unemployment rate was the lowest in recorded history, including for women and minorities. Hard work pays off - I am a product of it as are millions of Americans. The stock market took a huge hit in March when the virus hit and professionals said it would take two years for it to recover. Many people rely on a strong stock market as their retirement programs are heavily invested in it. My older coworkers were scared to death because their 401Ks took such a huge hit. But look how we’ve recovered! The Dow is back to where we were in February and the NASDAQ is 600 points higher than February! Liberals tend to say, “the stock market is only for the rich,” but there is nothing further from the truth. If you plan to retire happily one day, the stock market just may be your ticket. President Trump initiated “Opportunity Zones” in 2018 to spur economic development and job creation in distressed communities. These zones provide new investments, and under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. The best place for your hard earned dollars is your own pocket - Trump is a firm believer in lower taxes to encourage local economic growth. I work in healthcare and have seen firsthand the detriment that Obamacare has been to my fellow citizens. Universal healthcare is not the answer. Through the President’s “Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare,” the Trump administration gives patients the ability to choose the healthcare that is best for them - to make fully informed decisions based on knowing the price and quality of a good or service in advance. This puts healthcare providers into a place of competition, not monopoly, so quality is forced to increase while cost to patients is forced to decrease. I am an animal lover; I grew up with a dog in the house and I have cared for horses through the majority of my teen years. I can’t tell you enough how much I appreciate President a Trump signing “The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act”. This Act makes animal abuse a federal felony. We are the voice for the lives that have no voice. Along those same lines, I believe protecting the unborn, as they cannot speak for themselves. When I read Joe Biden’s policy on abortion, I was appalled. Biden says he would codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and restore federal funding to abortions via Planned Parenthood. Did you know that abortion clinics were originally placed strategically in the center of minority communities to reduce minority populations? Seriously, look it up. Trump supports the Hyde Amendment which bans the use of federal funds for abortion except in the horrific cases of rape, incest or in life-threatening circumstances. He is the only President that I can recall that has attended the March for Life. Our President respects the Military and has been actively returning our men and women to our homeland since he first took office in 2016. Prior to his election, I heard people say he would force our country into another war. There is nothing further from the truth. President Trump has been making peace and returning military to their families. He is also holding other countries accountable for the military services we provide to them. If they don’t pay for our services as they have agreed, our military returns home. On that same note, I am a huge supporter of strong borders. The Democrats will have you believe that only poor, hardworking immigrants are coming across the borders and we need to accept them regardless of their illegal status. What they won’t tell you about are the criminals that come into our country with drugs, guns, counterfeit products,etc. The left says nothing about the 800,000 sex trafficked citizens that are kidnapped and taken across the border. The only talking point that Democrats seem to push are the “cages that separate children from their families.” Let me be clear - Obama made those cages and put illegals in them. Beyond that, if our borders are strong and illegals cannot get into our country, the cages will have no use. Simple really. Americans value LEGAL immigrants because they have taken the necessary steps to become Americans. We want to live in SAFETY. President Trump has been accused of being a racist by the radical left. Let me explain to you a couple of reasons why this simply isn’t true. In Trump’s early years, way before he even ran for office, he encouraged equality among all races and supported all (truncated)",NA
"Good morning. I’m Dawn (Cat) from West Ga. I was raised in a split family, but grandparents were always red. I was spilt on my thoughts, but the older I get, the more Red I keep in my life. Even though majority of my “friends” are Red, I still battle with the FAR LEFT BLUES daily. It’s a constant battle, but when proof is there, they go quiet. My list is slowly shrinking, but I’m ok with that lol. Thanks for the add ❤️❤️",1

"Hi! My name is Melissa and I live in San Antonio, tx born and raised here! I grew up in a democratic family. My mom is from Mexico but now a citizen here and my Dad is from Texas as well. I was raised to have views as my parents but as I turned into an adult and had a family of my own I started realizing that my views did not align with the Democratic Party but I always just stayed quiet about it and just scared that my friends or family would judge me or call me out. My fiancé has the same views as me so it’s great we get to support each other. It’s been about a year now that I officially announced that I walked away from the Democratic Party and just yesterday that I support our president. I haven’t gotten any hate so far lol but I do feel proud of putting it out there! We should all respect each other’s different views or opinions and not have to hide them just to please others! I’m glad I found this page and hopefully I will make some new friends. Anyone is welcomed to add me on my fb page! 🙂",0
"Thanks for the add! My Name is Tristan,I grew up Amish-Mennonite and raised in Ohio, up until I turned 17 years old. I moved to Pennsylvania in 2013 joined the fire service and was a firefighter for 7 years. I was a Democrat up to Donald Trumps election in 2016. The Democratic Party goes against everything they believe in, they do not represent the people any longer. I live in a suburb on the line of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, I have grown to love my town and want to make a difference. From the inauguration to Covid-19 I watched the Democratic Party ruin our great country and I can’t sit back and not doing anything about it! To watch them tear everything down that our veterans fought so hard for is really sad! So I decided to run for State Representative for my District in 2022. Honestly I knew to politics but I know a change is needed and I’ll do anything to bring my community back together and stronger than ever!",0
"I began my voting life as a democrat because back then you followed your parents path and beliefs, but then it began to change. I really considered myself a moderate sharing beliefs from both sides. I always asked ""Why can't I hug a tree and own a gun?"". In today's world we have to take a deeper look at the issues before us and truly stand for what we believe, our country depends on it. As I looked and researched I did find that my beliefs aligned more with the conservative values of the republican party. My love of God, family and country are the foundation to my existence. I asked myself what does being a Republican mean to me? it means... R - Respect E – Equality P – Patriotism U – Unity B – Bravery L – Loyalty I – Integrity C – Courage A – Acceptance N – National Pride These are all the things that President Trump has brought to his presidency and I proudly stand with him and with you as we fight the fight of our lives to save our great country.

"I was the person that never voted. My “measly little one vote wouldn’t matter anyway.” I naively just assumed the elected presidents, would do good for the people. I don’t honestly think my father has ever voted. We just never cared, because it didn’t matter anyway, we were poor and we were thankful for simply being Americans. I became very passionate, almost overnight, when the BLM “movement” began. I had friends that were behaving incredibly hypocritical and I immediately felt, in my soul, this movement was not what it appeared to be. I began digging. And digging more. I’ll be voting for the first time in my life, at 35 years old, in November, for President Trump. This man is brutalized every single day and could have easily enjoyed his leisurely life, seemingly unbothered. He takes all the blows, yet he still shows up for the American people every single day, regardless the color of our skin. This white man’s pregnant wife, Gail Sue, was left to die in an alley after being brutally raped and beaten, by six black men. Unfortunately, not long after this event, the white woman would die in a house fire. This white man spent most of his days after that, being a severely broken and a very sad, lonely alcoholic. Approximately 14 years later, a black man walked onto this white mans private property and approached him. The black man said, “get the fuck out of my way, she’s mine” as he pointed in the direction of a 12 year old little white girl standing behind the white man. This was the first and ONLY altercation the white man had ever been in with a black man, who was twice his size. The white man ended up in a full out brawl, in the dirt, solely to protect this child and he was beaten black and blue. The police arrived and the black man was escorted off of the white mans property. The white man stayed there, because he had nothing but the little trailer on the lot that he worked SO hard to buy and he had no other options. The little white girl was thrown into the foster care system not too far down the road. The white man became a ward of the state, due to his alcoholism. The white girl went on to graduate high school with nearly all A grades, played sports and got involved in any extra curricular activity imaginable. When the white man became sober, after years and years of alcohol abuse and many visits to a jail cell, the little white girl reunited with the white man. Before, during and after these incidents, the white man never ONE time went and provoked any semblance of violence toward a black or white person out of hate. He never one time told the little white girl she needed to be afraid or racist against the black man. He said, they were just bad people who did bad things to other people. I am that little white girl in the belly of her mother, years later hiding behind her father. The collage photos are the white man today, bone dry sober, 15 years, with his family, including his two black grandchildren (my sisters children) but her story is hers to tell. He has never one time, looked at either one of them, with anything but love. Nobody in this family has ever told either one of them that they need to be fearful in this world because of the color of their skin. They are capable of anything and they have the opportunity to be whoever they wish, regardless of the hate and fear mongering my late mother and father encountered. Hate breeds hate, regardless of the skin color. Only when we choose to break the cycle, and we stop teaching racism, like it’s our freaking job, will it end. Race baiting and killing innocent people in the streets, will never be the answer. With this being said, I will not align myself with the mush brained protestors (some of whom wouldn’t know oppression or racism if it sat on their faces) and the antics being used to push our beautiful country in a direction that takes away my ability to choose my own morals and forge my own path. Please conduct REAL reasearch people. You have to dig and dig and sometimes dig further, but I promise you: it’s there to find, if you care enough to find it.",0

He's a fantastic President who truly cares and he's kept his promises.

"I never cared about politics. I spent my whole life believing that voting was a waste of time because all politicians are self serving liars and my vote wasn't going to change that. I never voted until I was 31 after going back to college as an adult and learning in my social science class just how important it was. Even then my vote was swayed by the people in my life and not through any research of my own. I was still blind. Something happened when covid19 came. Everything was closed down and I was told I had to wear a mask everywhere. I couldn't even get into my doctors office or have a surgery I needed. Something didn't seem right. I started doing my own research. I fact checked the fact checkers. I dug in. That's when my eyes were opened to the extreme cultish views of the left. The leftist media bias and constant lies coming from every news source. Then, the riots. More power grabbing and more lies. This country is being torn apart. I looked at every fake news story that tried to make our president look bad but all I could see was how people distorted everything he said. How they straight up lied about him. I saw the good things he has done since being in office. I learned about the racist, dishonest, power hungry past of the democratic party. I watched as they literally bowed to the radical left and their demands and it turned my stomach. For the first time in my life I started to feel like a patriot. I love this country and I don't want to see it destroyed. I vote Trump because I vote for America.",0
"WHY I AM NO LONGER A DEMOCRAT I am a big-hearted and strong-minded woman with a fierce sense of community responsibility. I fight for social justice, I make food for the homeless with love notes in the bags. I make “love bombs” (love notes from the universe) and leave them at the gas station or the grocery store for strangers to find. I take care of my friends and my family. I always thought that the Democratic party was more aligned with me. I was indoctrinated that liberals were “the good guys”. If you care about others, you are a Democrat and if you care only of yourself, you are a Republican. I have come to realize I was fooled. When I think of a perfect world, I think of a healthy earth, abundant soil, people who play more than they work, people who connect with others and live from their heart. I see a world where people are encouraged to find their passion and are able to make money from those passions. I picture strong communities with creative spirits living together and helping each other to thrive. I see wild animals moving through jungles and forests that are not being destroyed and pillaged for resources. I envision designer brands becoming meaningless because the new brands are luxuriously made with ethics, of natural materials that do no harm. These are the things I want for the earth and its people. I was raised to think and got trapped in thinking that liberal politics were closer to that....they were an okay compromise and ON THE PATH to that. I always felt it was the lesser of two evils. I knew that they take money from all of the corrupt corporations….but, they still care about people…right? Don’t they? At least more than the Republicans, right? I never really sat with the knowledge that if they take money from Johnson & Johnson, Monsanto, Pfizer, Google, Walmart, Bank of America THERE IS NO WAY they are working in the best interests of the population. Neither are the Republicans, I know. We need an overhaul of our politics in general. But what I realized this year is that there’s no space for FREEDOM under Democratic politics. There is only space for “listen to what we said, we know best for all of you”, and I am realizing that the only way that our earth will ever get anywhere near the world that I envision, is if the defenders of the earth and the defenders of the water and the defenders of children, are the people that are in power. We will never get there if we don’t have freedom to question government and question policies. Under the Democrats, I am only allowed to follow their rules. As I have begun questioning, I have seen in every part of my life that thinking differently is punishable by cold shoulders and vitriol- even by my liberal friends and family. Questioning the narrative is reckless and selfish. Critically thinking is ridiculed and shamed. On a wider scale, I have publicly asked questions on the pages of the politicians THAT I VOTED FOR. I am attacked and called a troll, told to go watch Fox News, accused of lying that I am a liberal. So today, I understand that APPARENTLY freedom over my body and whether or not I want vaccines, whether or not I want a mask over my face and whether or not I can go to work have made me a Republican. Wanting to listen to a wide range of doctors and scientists, instead of just the “approved ones” makes me a Republican. Believing that censorship of divergent voices is wrong makes me a Republican. So, this year I will be voting for any candidate who is in support of vaccine choice and any candidate who does not have ties to big Pharma. The pharmaceutical industry is in charge of all of the doctors and scientists that are spitting in the faces of the population and laughing behind their backs. If we are not free to make choices regarding vaccines, we are done. So my vote and my voice will be 100% behind any politicians that have spoken out against this coronavirus narrative, who have rejected mask orders and who do not support mandatory vaccines. So, I guess I am a Rebublican now. (or more Libertarian, but since we have a rigged two party system I will likely vote Republican) Bye Bye Dems. I have had it with you …. and I am not the only one.",0
"Thanks for adding me!😀 I always leaned to the left I thought they cared more about people and the right only cared about the rich & famous, wrong! I’ve come to the conclusion it’s been smoke and mirrors, the only thing that liberals care about is ""POWER"" & ""GREED"" anyway they can get it. Nothing ever truly changes when they are in control. I did NOT support Obama & his presidency was a mistake. There was just something about him that did NOT ring true. I realized what a mistake it was for America. He help create the radical left and brought racism back to an all time high. The BLM is exploiting a criminal’s death for their own agenda, lead by Soros, socialist liberals & the ignorant ultimately making things worse, we had no protests, we had anarchy, we had the BAD people looting, burning their own communities while the liberal politicians did NOTHING TO HELP their communities. BLM is funneling money to Democrats. Every 4 years the Dems become more evil & if the democratic voters don't wake up America & our freedoms as we know them will be gone! I'm tired of working my whole life & doing everything right while the poorly raised & the ignorant stand with their hands out for more & more ""FREE STUFF"". If there are no consequences for the bad or no accountability for the people holding us hostages in our own country we are doomed. I'm tired of the hate, ignorance & the word RACIST! I don’t agree with everything Trump says & does cuz he's not a politician, one of the reasons I voted for him, but he was definitely the right man for the job as President #walkingaway #trump2020 #saveamerica #stopsocialism",0
I am with #WalkAway. I always thought that when it came to politics if you voted Democrat it was to support the lower and middle class of society and only wealthy people voted Republican. My father who is a history nut told me that I have to figure out who my viewpoint aligns with more as a party and vote accordingly. I had never voted before and was living in South Carolina at the time when Barack Obama was running for his first term. I was so excited because of how far we have come I. This country with racism. I voted for Barack Obama the first time because I was ill informed. When his second term came up I had done all of my research and found out that the Democratic Party was a party of racism and then I could not understand why Obama identified with that party. (To be honest I am still a little confused about that one). I did not vote for Obama the 2nd time and have never voted Democrat since. Obama’s era made me research on my own and opened my eyes to what the true motivation of the Democrats are and then I felt sick that I ever said I identified with them. Now fast forward to today it is amazing to see that President Trump is doing so well in the face of so much adversity. The left have lost the ability to keep their true motives hidden any longer. Even the human trafficking and child molest concerns are not even mentioned on the left. It sickens me to think that so many of our country vote and believe in the ideologies of the Democratic Party. We need to come together not by the color of our skin but the love of our country. I thank you for accepting me into this group because I am starting to be an angry person when all I see and hear is lies and deceit from the left. Our country is the most important thing at the end of the day and we must fight to save it!,0
Walked away and never looked back in 1997. #WALKAWAY2020,NA
"This is my #WalkAway story, bear with me, it has been a long journey. On my 18th birthday I registered to vote, and registered as a Democrat. I come from a family of inter-generational Democrats. We were Roosevelt and Kennedy Democrats ever since my Irish and German family came to America. I was a social justice warrior before the term had been coined. All my heroes were Leftists, and I thought the Left had a monopoly on virtue. I got involved in social work and anti-gang intervention programs in the inner city; always keen to manifest into action the ideals I espoused. I believed wholeheartedly in the victimhood narratives; society was to blame, and more specifically, the rich – which meant Republicans. In my early 20s I converted to Islam, and I took all those sociopolitical concepts with me; it wasn’t long before I became radicalized. All the typical Leftist indictments against America morphed into religious condemnations. I was never involved in any anti-American groups, but I held extremist views. I moved to the UAE in the early 2000s, and precipitated a confrontation with a German man whose behaviour I deemed immoral, things escalated, and the man tragically died as a result of my actions. I was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death. It took this horrific chain of events, this descent into, really, the madness of radicalization, to finally jar my mind out of the indoctrination. For the next 7 years, I read everything I could get my hands on in prison, not only about politics, history, and economics, but about Islam and the way extremists warp the teachings of the religion. When I was eventually released, after it was established that the man’s death was not intentional, I moved to Turkey and actively wrote in support of democracy and against violent extremism. My writing focused on nonviolent strategies for the people in Egypt to resist the military coup in that country, because I saw how easily activists could be swayed by jihadi rhetoric and the whole nation could be plunged into a Syria-like civil war. Despite this, I was portrayed in the media as someone who incited violence – never mind that I received death threats from ISIS and was condemned by the Muslim Brotherhood. I started to see strong correlations between the extremism among Muslims and radical Leftists. The intolerance, the stridency, the echo chamber quality of discourse, and the destructive Utopian delusions that make the demolition of society as we know it the prerequisite to establishing their Ideal State; extremist Islamists and “woke” activists share all of these pathologies. Still, when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, I was crushed. I despised Hillary Clinton, but I loathed Trump even more. Nevertheless, I vowed to remain objective. Over the past 4 years, I have watched the Left nurture a mania against this man that is truly psychotic, while he has implemented policies that are inarguably beneficial to the country. He has shown us all the power of the presidency. He has been decisive, he has been proactive, he has genuinely put America first, and he is the first president in my lifetime who I feel sincerely loves the United States and the American people. After decades of, first, Left-wing propaganda, and then radical Islamism, President Trump has restored my patriotism and hope for my country. As I watch Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the “woke” movement terrorize America’s cities, I know very well where this will lead, and the Liberals simply do not care. As someone who has followed these kinds of ideologies to their terrible conclusions, I can say unequivocally that they hate the United States, and quite literally, our president is the only thing standing in their way. We all have to stand with him.",0

"Many years ago I walked away. Back in high school I would say I was a dumbass libtard thinking the world owed me something and I knew everything. Joining the military after graduation and witnessing how the Clintons (especially Killary) treat vets and military personnel I walked to red quickly. After education myself on demoncrat history, it made me sick . That party loves America and hates Americans. I just don’t see how anyone with a brain cell could support that party. Republicans do need to grow a spin and stomp out the evil in the Democratic Party. Red will be my party for the rest of my life , after I die please make sure I don’t vote democrat.",0

I walked away this year. I'm not your typical conservative I'm wiccan I'm part of the LGBTQ community. Yet when I started walking away I was told I had white privilege I was a racist a bigot. This came from the same party I defended for 24 years. I'm 42 now. I believe in all live matters in backing the blue. Oh well it's a shame so many of the leftist are blinded by ignorance and hate in their hearts. I will not be a victim never have been never will be.,0
My Husband and I were both raised as Democrats. We were told that only rich people could be Republicans.

"In the spring of 1977, I was getting ready to graduate high school and I had just turned 18. I had been asked to work at our town polling station which was city hall. While working at the polls that Election Day I registered as a Republican in a town where only 5 people were Republicans. When I came home, I told my parents and grandparents that I had NOT registered as a Democrat. I wish I had a video to show the reaction they had to that decision. I was promptly asked what I had done and why. My reply was simply that I could not in good conscience align myself with the platform of the Democrat party and be a Christian at the same time. Abortion was the deciding factor in becoming a Republican. My family always voted Republican for President, never once for the Democrat but as a Republican in the Florida Panhandle in 1977 there were no candidates for office until the general election. For me it was the time to decide where I stood. I have never regretted that decision but I believe a lot of people just do as their parents have done but we all are individuals and we have a mind of our own, educated or not. I could not then and I cannot now reconcile Christianity with the Democrat Party. For me it was as simple as that.",1
"This campaign gives me such hope! Reading your stories has filled my heart with joy and continues to validate my belief that America will survive this attack from within. I was raised in a VERY liberal, atheist household. I was taught to believe that Republicans are evil people who only care about money and not about people. Democrats are the tolerant and loving ones who care about the plights of humanity. Ha! I married a conservative man, but we never talked about politics. Ever. I voted for Gore and mocked Bush’s lack of finesse and went along with media criticism. Until 9/11...that event, watching President Bush in his calm demeanor, comforting our nation, sparked something inside me. I started asking my husband questions. What do republicans really believe in? He’s a lawyer and answered with facts. I realized in that moment that I align more as a conservative. I made a decision that I would vote for a Bush in his 2nd election. When my father found out, he was furious. He practically disowned me, telling me I represent all that is bad. It got ugly. I was devastated. But I stayed true to my beliefs. We had many years of discourse between us. After trying as forcefully as he could, for nearly 20 years, to convince me I am wrong and persuade me back to the Democratic Party, he has stopped. He realizes that nothing he says will change my views. It’s interesting, in all these years, I never tried to CHANGE his views. I just had hoped he would accept mine! I have witnessed the education system beat down on my son for defending Trump and I have spoken up. A young man on this site recounted that Hitler spoke of controlling the minds of the youth, thus controlling the future. It’s frightening. I have been a proud Republican for 20 years! I love all people and I don’t care what your skin looks like. I support anyone’s life...period. I want to spread as much love and light and unity as possible. I believe in law enforcement and I believe in mutual respect. I walked away from the media 3 years ago. Best decision I ever made! Sending you all love and light!!! Trump 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸",0

Born and raised democrat. Mom was into the party. As kids we would walk the neighborhood and knock on the doors for candidates or issues. Now all is see is hate and corruption. We THE PEOPLE have let our leaders go to long without restrain. We have let them have their way with out our say. The Democratic party is now the Democratic Socialism party. How that happened I don't know. But we must take back our country. Right now I don't know if that's going to be possible without force. I just hope that the pen is mightier then the sword.,0
"I was an independent but still voted for Trump in 2016, but recently changed my status to republican so I could vote in the primaries. I will vote republican straight down the line in Nov. These dems have totally lost there minds and are destroying our country just for the soul purpose of getting votes. It scares me that a group would go so far in malice with no consideration to what they are doing to the citizens of this great country. I often wonder if they think we have no idea of what they are doing or just don't care if we know. I guess alls I can say is God bless Trump for working as hard as he does and deals with all the grief thrown his way from the Dems. Every thing he does , he does For our country and its great peaple and the Dems just turn it and twist it to make him look bad. It takes one special man to tolorate what he puts up with. God bless you Trump and all you are doing for us.",1
"Thank you for the add. It is reassuring to know there are so many of us. My story is not as dramatic as some. It's simple, I was never one to vote party so it never mattered to me what label I used until the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing. I felt that the man was on trial not up for confirmation. You are all aware of what went on I don't need to rehash it. There are too many things to list, they continue every day. Bottom line I could not continue to be a part of, even if in name only, a part of these injustices. It only got worse after that. My reckoning came when I was asked if I wanted to change parties when I renewed my license. I blurted out yes and officially changed parties. It was my very personal protest to show just how disconnected I was from the Dems. Thank you for letting me share and letting me know we are not alone. Let's make America Great Again...

"I've been in this group for some time now but have never told my story. I've been voting Democrat all my life (I'm 75) just because my parents did. I know not a good reason. In 2016 I went to see the movie Hillery's America. That movie opened my eyes to what the Democrat party stands for. I know it was just a movie but it contained a lot of history. History that unvailed things about the Democrat party that I never knew. I voted for Obama twice because I thought he would try to heal the divide in this country, inregards to race relations. Not only did he not try he made matters worse. The thought of waking up to Hillery every morning did not appeal to me, so I picked the lesser of 2 evils and voted for Trump. I'll be voting for Trump in 2020 and all other Republicans in order to take back the House and keep the Senate.",0
"My story... I was raised by two, very liberal parents that were your classic 1960'/70's youth at the time. I was raised to be free in my thinking, arts, what I wore, how I talked and was hardly punished if I did anything wrong. On the other side of our home lived my grandparents who were God fearing, work hard, obey the rules type of people. I was living with two polar opposites of adults in my home, so I saw a lot of different types of character. Naturally I followed in the footsteps of my parents and thought as a Democrat for years, and I don't know if the word liberal was around back when I was a teenager and in my early twenties but you could also count me as that too. But I came to Christ (totally different story), had children, and I grew up. For awhile I was on state assistance and I saw how abused the system was and is and I was appalled watching people like the caseworkers even allow the system to be abused. I used it when I NEEDED it and got off as soon as I could! I started voting Republican I started thinking conservative about 12 years ago if not longer and telling people how the system is abused. My family didn't believe me! I freaking lived it and that thought I was lying! Then as the years went by I had family members laugh at me, make fun of me and in the long run, I now don't even speak to them along with my own father. In his own words, ""what the hell happened to you, I thought I raised you better than this""... All because I vote for Trump. Well I'm here to tell you, I'll vote for him again in November!",0
"I don't have that much of a story to share but thought I would put in my two cents worth. I was raised in a Democrat family and just kind of thought that made me one too. I never really paid much attention to politics that much although I did vote, but didn't really put much thought or research into it. Then Obama was running for President and for the first time I knew I would not vote for him; nor did I the second time he ran. I was so disappointed he got elected twice but didn't act like the Democrats are now about having Donald Trump as our President. I just accepted it and hoped for the best. When Donald Trump started campaigning for the first time I felt we had someone who was for the people, not a career politician, was not worried about being politically correct, was a good businessman, and loved our country and wanted to best for it. I have never looked back. I admit I told maybe one other person I was voting for him; the stigma was just so bad. Once he really was elected I started to speak out that I voted for him and was no longer ashamed of it. I have been unfriended by family and friends on FB because I am for our President. I still have an older sister in her late 80's who hates our President so bad. We try not to talk about it, but one day she admitted she guessed she was a Democrat because Daddy was; our father passed away in 1984! I told her these Democrats are not what our father would have voted for it is a totally different party now!",1
"There are so many of us! I have always been kind of an a-political, Independent hippie wanting the government out of my life as much as possible, and agreeing with policies on both sides of the divide. The majority of my family are service members and American Pride is a way of life for us. I love it here! There is no where else that I would rather be! This group resonates with me. I voted for many Democrat’s along the way, I even changed my party from Independent to Democrat before Obama. When Trump came into the picture, I was super annoyed with his egotistical personality, and his communication skills leave something to be desired. I voted for Bill Clinton and for Obama, but I damn sure wasn’t voting for Hillary because she is a slimy girl... secretive, deceitful, cold, calculating, and manipulative. She is the epitomy of everything that’s wrong in our government. So, I was in an awful position in 2016.... I hated them both! Friends kept talking to me about his policies and ideas, and his love of this country. I was at a point where I thought we needed to clean up the corruption in DC, what did we have to lose, a bunch of slimy politicians￼￼? Sending in a businessman molotov cocktail to shake things up and clean out the trash seemed like the best option... and I am happy with my choice. I would much rather have a man who speaks the raw truth, even if it hurts some people’s feelings, than one who manipulates people into believing the lies coming out of their mouth every time they speak. Finally someone who puts America first! I walked away from my Father’s generation of Democrats. That party has changed from helping people to making them dependent on handouts. Instead of helping them up... they are holding them back. If you give your children everything they could ever want... there is no incentive for them to get up and go get what they need. It cripples them! It’s a cycle of entitlement that I did not give my children, and if you know my kids... you can see first hand what drive, ambition, personal responsibility, and accountability really is. Life is about integrity... that is non-negotiable. I, for one, will not be held back. I am not oppressed, and the only privilege I have is being an American, and I’m proud of it. I owe no one for my life, except the men and women who serve to protect it. The only person that I can thank for getting me where I am today, is myself. That’s what pride is all about. My life has changed a lot since 2016... and thanks to him, I am even more independent than I have always been. It starts in the mind... ✌️❤️🇺🇸 #FreeYourself #PeaceLoveAmerica #FreedomReigns #RealHippiesLoveAmerica #SocialismSucks #CommunismKillsCountries",1
I am glad I found this group. I am a retired AF and Civil Servant. Most of my Adult Life I believed that the Democratic Party served the interest of our country and especially Blacks and other minorities. I still believed this myth until Obama. I even voted for him his first term against the advice of my younger brother. After watching his sly contempt for White People and disregard for our military I changed my mind. I truly believe he was the beginning of a sly attempt to unravel all that we have built in this country. We are not perfect but we have strived and improved. I am 73 years old and I have been around through some dramatic changes in this country and I am deeply disappointed that a group of people who have done nothing would attempt to toppled all that I spent most of my years building. I voted for President Trump in 2016 and I will be voting for him in 2020.,0
"Hey guys, I’ve been a Tea Party Conservative my entire life. I’m a #walkwith brother. Recently I’ve been discouraged seeing all the division and animosity among our people, and knowing that we are close to civil war, my heart has sunk for our nation. But, a close friend invited me to this page a couple days ago, and already my spirits are lifted! Thank you so much for letting me in on this group! If anyone here new to the conservative/right wing/ Republican thing has a lot of questions about all what conservatives stand for, feel free to DM me and I’ll happily fill you in 😁😁",NA
"Hi all you beautiful people!! I’ve been in this group for about a week. Your stories are such a breath of fresh air for me! Thank you all for sharing seeing through the BS!! I am not walking away from anything. I have always been a republican. My dad is a WW2 Vet US Airforce Colonel retired. My late brother was in the Army was an aircraft Mechanic. My other brother was Airforce bulldozer driver and my oldest brother was a medic in 3 wars and he is a Doctor Air Force retired. Still runs a VA clinic. Uncles cousins all fought for the freedoms we have in this beautiful country. I’m disgusted by the people that spread hate across our country. The sadness I felt has turned bitter. I’m totally disgusted and cannot even allow myself to get into an argument with such ignorance and hate any longer. They don’t listen and they find reason to attack you for anything! I am the administrator of a town group and i have about 4000 members. Once the young people started posting about BLM and changing the world from racism my group changed overnight. After a couple of weeks of allowing it ( i try to be fair and balanced) i stopped it and then the conservatives started posting things. So all these people that cannot post anymore BLM and change the world crap complain and find fault and message me etc. accusing me of only allowing what i agree with and being biased. I allow politics on Thursday’s only now but the liberals are brutal and hurtful and hateful. I had to actually make an announcement that you have the right to disagree with the President but you will not swear at his name or post hateful memes about him. I delete them one by one because they cannot stop once they start attacking. I have in my rules, If you cannot prove your point while being respectful you will be removed. Now these people point me out and say things like oh we know who you support now. We know your biased and won’t let anything stay up that’s not a conservative view! You hate democrats! Blah blah. I don’t hate anyone. I hate what they’ve done to our country and our young minds!! So i came to this group because i raised my daughter and she’s always been like me, I didn’t make her a conservative, she just is! She’s in college and she keeps quiet because well you know how colleges are very liberal. I want to hear your stories. I am very proud of my family and all the men and women that fought for our country and the people that continue to fight to keep our country up and running! How can they turn a blind eye to all the crime and violence all the destruction and looting. When will it ever end? Our great president sends help to save our cities and he’s accused of making it worse!! That’s just another ridiculous claim by the hate party! Everything that President Trump says or does is attacked only because they lost and they hate him for it! Biden is not fit to feed himself let alone run a country he helped ruin with Obama. Please keep what you’re doing and save our country By voting for president Trump! His work is not done here! Drain that friggen swamp!! Thank you! ❤️",NA
I really cannot help but like/love all these post. I love sitting in my quiet corner reading post after post of you guys stories! Some of them bring me to tears and others make me proud! One thing for sure they all give me hope! Hope for a different outcome...hope for a fighting chance... hope for a better tomorrow! Thank you to each and every one of you for the hope you give me!! #NovemberCantComeSoonEnough #VoteRed2020,NA
"Hello, I walked away from being a Democrat in July 2016 after Hillary won the Democrat Primary. Benghazi was the line for me. I am now an Unaffiliated voter (independent). I have always voted for who I thought was best for the position. I registered as a Democrat in my twenties only because the county Im in leaned that way and I followed not really being in politics much then. (I am 50 now). In reality I’ve always been conservative and over the past 4 years I’ve realized how right I really lean. I’m a God loving, USA loving, all people loving, hard working country girl. I don’t agree with every choice of words or tone Trump uses but one thing is certain......Trump loves America as much as he loves himself and I’ll take that!!! He wants this country and all its people to be successful, free and happy!! He wants law and order to protect us. I support our military and police 125%. I do not support the bad apples, and every organization has them. What I despise is name calling, belittling people, twisted facts, and not allowing people to have opinions. There is so much evil in this world and the evil will do anything to win......... I’m not a conspiracy theorists but I’m not blind either. Our country had moved so far and now it’s being divided by evil using the past. There is always room to improve but living in the past, allowing the past to keep you down, playing the blame game, feeling entitled is only excuses to be nothing and never improve. I love reading everyone’s stories, it has been such inspiration and a positive for me. This is unity.....this is love.....this is making our country great together! All people, all walks of life....no judgement. We together have got to get out and vote, get others to vote. Be a strong voice with compassion, love, empathy and zero hate! No name calling, no violence. Even when we want to explode, let’s be bigger together. And most of all...pray pray pray!",1
"Hi #walkaway family!! I joined this group around the time it first started. Thank you Brandon Straka for having the courage to start this group!! My story: I'm a loud and proud Conservative that's finally come out of the closet! Ha!!😁🇺🇸 I was raised a liberal Dem so I followed along voting Democrat in every election believing without question what I was told -- that all Republicans were wealthy people that didn't care about the working poor. Throughout the years I did start questioning my political beliefs and began listening to both sides all the while becoming even more confused not knowing what to believe. I was Hillary supporter and convinced I'd vote for her but then it became personal for me. A drunk driver (repeat felon) ran a red light plowing into my suv nearly killing me and forever changing my life. I was a very active person that walked our rescue dogs 2 hrs. daily and after the wreck standing/walking is excruciatingly painful. 2 mos.hosp stay, multiple pelvic breaks, perm. nerve damage in my leg/foot, etc.. The driver had no ins., no job and had been released from jail the same day he hit me and after hitting me he ran from the scene. The detective working the case said the lib judge had refused to issue a bench warrant but after multiple attempts he finally changed his mind. In Nov. 2016 I voted for Donald Trump and never looked back. I won't support criminal coddlers and that's exactly what Democrats are - dangerous and destructive for you, me and everyone else. Thanks for reading.🥰🇺🇸👏‼ #Trump2020",0
I am a 64 year old White Male Born and raised in Philadelphia. Moved to Harleysville Pa. 20 years ago cause the neighborhood was not where I could no longer raise my family. Voted Democrat for 42 years till after seeing the Democratic party be taken over by the Progressive Liberal Socialist. Trump was not my choice from President but I could never vote for Hillary Clinton. So after the election I finally #WALKEWAY and CHANGED my registration to Republican. I know the party isn't perfect but it's far better than what's going on by the Radical Leftist Movement. God Bless America Protect us from Evil...,0
"Hello everyone! My name is William and I am a 26 year old, gay, Independent. A few short years ago I would have described myself as a liberal. I identify with the,”outsider,” and the weirdo and I viewed conservatism as a champion for conformity and values I simply didn’t agree with. One of my greatest aspirations is to be a novelist, I love words and I love their ability to stir feelings and provoke introspection. I wanted to be able to do that for people as it had been done for me countless times since I was a child. While living in California I attended a community college while I worked a full time job and while there I pursued English and writing as my major. I loved the diverse environment that my college provided and most people were open to new ways of looking at things, provided that it fit a specific mold. I noted this through out my time there, but never saw it as an issue because I too was a liberal and if thats what people were feeling then certainly they were on to something, especially since I was in academia. I learned about racism, colonialism, the general unfairness people of color faced and I empathized, as I happen to be a gay man to boot! Sometimes I would be told,” This is something you won’t understand, your whiteness will stop you from understanding this.” When I would hear this I felt distraught, not because I agreed, but because my empathy wasn’t welcome, nor was my input in an environment where I was convinced all opinions were welcome. Now, i’ll admit here that there are things I won’t understand. Some of the pain people feel will be foreign to me and thats ok, as long as I’m self-aware of my own ignorance then I can work towards a deeper understanding of the human condition. I even shelved these moments as, “things I simply do not understand and might some day if I relinquish my privilege,” and I was totally on board with deconstructing this bubble I, apparently, lived in. But, one day, when I was in a creative writing class, I was given an assignment to write a short story to be peer reviewed by a small group of students. I was so excited to do this because it was something I loved, something that sustained me and it is something I think about constantly, even now. I racked my brain for something worth writing about, in twenty pages or less. I love history, I love people over coming terrible odds or even trying to survive hopeless situations, these stories inspire me. California was host to Asian internment camps back in the 40’s and it was jarring to me that once upon a time such a thing existed in the town I lived in (Fresno, CA). So, also being a huge admirer of Akira Kurosawa and Japanese culture as a whole, I decided to try to get into the minds of a small family of immigrants who were being threatened with the camps. They had to make a decision of if they would stay and ride out the treatment by the camps or return to Japan. It was a family of three generations. An elderly patriarch, who was pro-Hirohito, his son who was trying to be seen as American, his wife who was trying to be a dutiful wife/mother and their son who has never seen Japan and only knows America and American life. I wrote non-stop for days, did hours of research, rewrote it several times trying to add those dramatic aspects that I had seen in Kurosawa films and then when it was due I excitedly submitted it to the small panel of students including my Chicano professor. The panel of students absolutely loved it, including the one person on the panel who happened to be half-latino/half-japanese. He told me his grandparents acted some of the ways the patriarch acted in my story and he was convinced that who wrote it was Japanese. I was so happy to get this kind of feed back because it told me that I had done my job as a writer. I was able to create the fantasy and make it believable. However, when it came to my professor he didn’t note on ANYTHING other than one detail. I wasn’t Japanese and I wrote about Japanese characters. Nothing about the story flow, nothing about the syntax, not a criticism of any kind about my use of adjectives. Just, simply, I was white and I was writing about something I couldn’t fathom on the basis of my skin color. My liberal sensibilities told me to let it go and accept the fact that there was simply some things I would not understand. But, my sensibilities as a writer were enraged. Why did it matter if I wasn’t Japanese, I could clearly understand the fear, uncertainty, and hopelessness of a situation that seemed out of their control. Wasn’t that a part of the human condition, being faced with insurmountable odds and having to make impossible decisions? Wasn’t that something every human had to face at one point in their life, perhaps not in the same macro sense as this family, but as a working class person, working full time to pay for only the first step in a long career as a student? Clearly not and whats more he wanted me to (truncated)",NA
"I started as a Democrat because my parents were Republicans. I voted for Jimmy Carter 3 times....now you know where I am from. As I matured, I got more involved with the Democrat party.....even ran local campaigns. The killing of babies and the giving my money to people who cross our border illegally while requiring me to pay me more for everything was why I walked away.",0
"My husband and I were Democrats up to this year with all that the democrats have done we are now republican and we are so proud of our President, he is doing a great job and we will vote for him again.",NA
"I grew up republican in a democratic county in in a liberal city. My uncle was a senator in the Republican Party. I was taught at an early age patriotism. My fathers family staunch republicans. My mother’s family catholic Democrats. They did come around when my mother married my father and my uncle was appointed to fill a vacant seat as a representative then later as he was elected senator. I participated in numerous campaigns, was part of the young republicans. When I was growing up and starting to date two things were asked. What is your political affiliation and what is your religion. Political affiliations was before religion. My father had to belong to a union. Just the way the big city I grew up in was. When my parents were invited to President Nixon’s inauguration my father was not given the time off to go. He was not allowed to put a Republican sticker supporting a candidate on his car. Our house was targeted numerous times with vandalizim because our neighbors knew who we were. I was called out in class at school because they knew I was related to a US senator and teachers tried to embarrass me by asking me questions they didn’t think I could answer. I’ve seen the ugly side of the Democratic Party first hand. I’ve watched my father get passed over for promotions because of his last name. I will always stand for freedom and liberty.",1
"I used to be a conservative Democrat. Like, welfare isn’t a career but we can’t let gramma starve. My party took off so far left my head spun. I’m not a republican or Democrat. I am an American with common sense! Trump 2020!",1
"I want to explain something. I #walkedaway last September when I witnessed first hand sitting in the state senate chambers just how beholden every freakin’ Democrat is to the Big Pharma lobby and money. I saw it. I watched the vote go down with thousands protesting inside and outside of our State Capitol. I watched as parents cried, mothers were arrested (and they didn’t burn anything down) I listened to a 23 minute passionate plea from Senator Stone who is a Pharmacist, he suggested that the committee listen to the stories, and was denied. I lost every single ounce of respect I held for a party that is supposed to be about freedom of choice, inclusivity, and bodily autonomy. I watched Senator Richard Pan meet with lobbyists behind closed doors. I saw it. I was there. It was that day that I realized just how corrupt and disgusting it all is. It was that day that changed everything for me personally. So people can say “ I’ve changed” you know what? I have. I absolutely have. I will NEVER support a party that systematically wants to take choice away, unless it’s what suits their definition of choice. I want to make it abundantly clear that I was disgusted. #walkedaway",0

"I was NON-political for the first 20 years of my life. I absolutely ABHORED Government class in high school and had no interest whatsoever in how our government functioned or why. I knew nothing about the US Constitution. Joining the National Guard at 17 years old under the ""delayed entry"" program and still in high school infused 'some' patriotism in me. My big political awakening came later when my boss would play Rush Limbaugh on the radio everyday on the job from noon to 3pm. Rush made learning about politics fun. He is very gifted at ""recognizing the truth"". He also taught me how the broken manner in which the liberal mind operates, including in the mainstream ""lying"" news medias. My sole purpose with my testimonial is to advise my much cherished new conservative-convert brothers and sisters is to ""BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU GET YOUR NEWS FROM"". Fox News on cable is starting to veer in a liberal direction, but you still have Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingram and maybe a couple others that are still worth listening to. Rush Limbaugh is still on the radio daily from Noon EST to 3pm, usually on AM radio. Most of good conservative news comes from conservative news sites on the web: breitbart.com, dailycaller.com There are many others. The only way to counteract all the lies you've believed in the past is to replace it with the truth. Being careful with your source of news can help achieve this. God bless you all!",NA

"Hi everyone. I joined awhile back and have really enjoyed reading all stories. I walked away 19 years ago, but the reason I did is more relevant today than ever. I finally worked up the courage to share my story, so here it goes. I was born and raised in Chicago, lived there until my late 20’s when I moved to the suburbs. When you live in Chicago, you’re automatically a Democrat. You don’t think about it or discuss it …. you just are. It’s handed down like a family tradition. My family wasn’t super political, we didn’t really discuss politics. We watched the local news, mostly the NBC affiliate Channel 5 in Chicago. Sometimes we watched the network news afterwards, but not often. Fast forward and 9/11 happens. I became a news junkie … I couldn’t get enough. So, for the first time I watched cable news. Naturally because I grew up watching NBC, I started watching MSNBC. I have a tendency to be a channel surfer, so anytime commercials came on I switched over to CNN. There was a bill the Democrats were bringing up for a vote (for the life of me I can’t remember what it was.) It was a bill that was a no brainer, everyone should want it passed. The Republicans were against it. For weeks I watched the parade of Democrats on MSNBC and CNN talk about how awful the Republicans were for being against the bill. I bought into the hatred night after night. One night during a commercial on MSNBC, I switched to CNN. They also had a commercial, so I just kept surfing. I stumbled upon Fox. They had a Republican on talking about this particular bill so I left it on. I wanted to hear them explain their awful stance. It turns out the Republicans were FOR the bill. The Democrats had tied it to an ANOTHER bill that was horrendous the Republicans refused to pass it. Not once did I ever hear that on MSNBC or CNN. I am embarrassed to say it was the first time I learned that they tied bills together to force passage. (I know both parties do it, there should only be clean bills allowed… 1 thing at a time.) (Just look at the crap that was hidden in the middle of Obama Care). It was then that I realized I had spent my entire adulthood up to that point never hearing the other side of the story. How many things did I get wrong because I believed the liberal media half-truths or outright lies? You think you’re just watching the news, not liberal or conservative … just the news. But you’re not. You are literally being indoctrinated. You don’t know what you don’t know. If the media was that biased then, now it’s biased on steroids! 19 years and I have never looked back. These days when I watch Fox, I make sure I don’t just watch the right leaning opinion shows like Hannity, etc. I make sure I watch shows like Outnumbered or The Five. I purposely watch shows that feature Democrats like Juan William (ugh) or Donna Brazille (double ugh) so I can hear the other side. I consider myself an Independent, although I have found I am more conservative than I would have ever guessed. Let me hear both sides of the story and I will make up my own mind. I like to think that if the Democrats ever found a decent candidate, I would be open minded enough to hear them out. In reality, that will never happen. The Democratic party has moved so far left there is no coming back from it. Moderate Democrats should be taking the red pill in droves! I hope my story can help wake up at least one person and get them to listen to the other side.",0
Thanks for the add I'm a lifelong Republican however I work for Department of Homeland Security and I'm sickened by the way my colleagues are treated now.

"I was born into a Democrat family, mom dad grandparents you get the idea. The first time I voted was for John Kerry and when he lost I felt broken. Next time around I fell into the ""change we can believe in"" trap. I voted for Obama I felt like I had done the right thing, felt like things were going to get better. Then the reality of the situation kicked my teeth in. I lost a good job because of the economic decline, found another one, that plant went belly up for the same reason. I ended up trying to support a family of 4 on a part time job paying 8.25 an hour doing work not fit for any man, working condition were terrible and one man died doing the same job as me. We tried to get assistance but were told we were to white... Not an exaggeration. So next election I didn't vote. Wasn't worth my time and I thought they both sucked. Ide given up on everything politics, family, life. I was drowning my self in booze hopeing if I died at least my family might get help. I felt betrayed and blamed everyone for my problems. Then one day I see Trump come down an escalator... And I thought who the hell does he think he is? No way he's gonna drop out in a month this has to be for the camera. Then he didn't drop out, and I started listening. And the more I did the more I liked what I saw. And then I seen HER up on stage talking about how great a job she and Obama did and how we needed to stay on that path. My blood began to boil I looked at my wife and kids and how we were living and thought if this is what we have to look forward to then I should just end myself I couldn't keep going on living in poverty and poaching small game to feed my kids while my wife and I started our selves so they would have enough to eat. my vote for Trump was my last stand if he failed it was game over. I was seriously considering suicide. After the vote we went home and ate a rabbits I had shot the day before. I had no TV so I got out an old battery powered radio and tuned in to hear the results. And when all the Democrat hosts started breaking down in tears because it looked hopeless for Hillary that was the first time in 8 years I had felt hope. When he won I cheered so loud the neighbors dog started barking. Now fast forward 3.5 years. We have moved to a new town live in a home I couldn't have ever imagined I could afford and even though the shutdown has effected us I have a good job and we are all well fed with no government assistance. My kids are happy and so is my wife. I thank God every day for sending us Trump he truly saved my life and the lives of my family. It has not been without cost. My vote cost me many of my friends and family. I had and still have to work hard every day but I wouldn't trade any of it for anything. I proudly ware my MAGA hat without shame or fear. Some call me a racist for it, I have had my car vandalized and been spit on but I keep my head high. Trump change the game and I will do my best to see that he stays in the game for 4 MORE YEARS!!! God bless the president and God bless the USA.",0

Thank you for walking away! ❤️ These next few months are gonna be insane! These lunatic democrats will do anything to get Trump out of office! TRUMP WILL WIN BY A LANDSLIDE!!! He is fighting for us! He is fighting for the children!!! He is fighting for our freedom! 🙌 #SaveTheChildren #Trump2020,NA
"Growing up I leaned democrat thinking well they want people to be more free and independent, but always in the back of mind I felt it was rigged, only putting in candidates hand picked beforehand so I always liked the idea of Independent just never understood why more people didn't. Only being born in 91 seeing Bush become Obama and 9/11 in 5th grade got me thinking. False flag excuse, to war for what they want with our army. So really since watching this documentary by a lady in the netherlands ah what it's Fall Cabal basically says how the military put him in place to overthrow the shadow government and while the 1st started the worst of covid lockdown in march I was watching that and hearing seeing things saying how they trained dudes for the certain type of warfare and certain earthquakes were undergound military deepstate controlled bunkers being destroyed and a tainted batch of adrenachrome from wuhan specially marked to prove they were using it. That basically turned me Republican, just agree with stability and no more nonsense. The founding fathers warned that the 2 party system would only be good for so long and I think that time is up. So I walked away and believe we should re-elect Trump for for four more years. He atleast deserves the same 8 years the past how many others had? And then Independent until both parties are gone. Just my opinion, thank you for reading.",1
"First time posting here!! I just want to say that every story I read brings me such great emotions. Happiness, sadness, sorrow.. So many absolutely wonderful people here in this group. So uplifting and positive.. I have been a supporter of what i feel is the greatest President ever, President Trump.. I will continue to support him and vote for him again in November.. I happily voted for him in 2016 and have lost a few friends but as i see it they were never really friends to begin with if they could so easily throw our friendship away over differing opinions .. Cheers to another 4 Years of MAGA with MY President Trump!!! To all who have or are serving our great country a huge Thank you for your service!!! #walkwith ... Thank you for having me in your group..",NA
Hello My name is Daniel myself as Gay Man also I was first generation to break Republican family since I was Democrat due my deafness till My Best friend is Republican he changed my view and realizing that Democrat have been changed since 2008 so I decided to change my status to Independent Voters but will be voting for Republican 2020,NA
"I have known for years that the media lies to us, but I guess I just didn’t care because I mostly agreed with what they were saying. As I’ve gotten older, my morals and what’s important to me has changed, and I felt I didn’t really have a party that I truly belonged to. Several months ago, I stopped watching the news because I could see that they were lying to me everyday, I could even start predicting exactly what they were going to say. I was not a Trump fan at all. I, along with so many people, thought he was an idiot because that’s what they told me. But I saw people that I respected, respecting him and I started asking questions. It didn’t really lead anywhere. I wasn’t ready. In May, my good friend told me that she had been doing some investigating and she thought that maybe we were wrong about Trump after all! She told me about Q and Out of Shadows, and so much more! I was intrigued because her and I have a very similar outlook on the world. She is very logical and I respect her. What she was saying, gave me hope and a sense of security and purpose! Once I started researching, I couldn’t believe how wrong I had it! And these last few months, seeing the hatred that the extreme left has for this country is despicable. I am a PROUD PATRIOT now! I have never felt more proud to be an American than I do today and we need to fight for this country! #Trump2020 #WalkAway My twitter handle if you want to follow a firecracker! ☺️ @MarniCaradonna",0
"Thanks for the add. I guess I’ll tell my #WalkAway moment. I was born and raised in Brooklyn New York. Family, the typical democrat of course. In 1996 I began questioning some thing and started paying attention to certain details. I’ve noticed that in my community blacks vote democrat based off fear. I would hear things like “if so and so don’t win then the other guy is going to take away our social security” and other nonsense. A young 15 yeah old me asked the simply question which made me a target by my own community and family. I simply asked “if we vote this person in what will we gain? If you look around we haven’t been receiving anything. In fact things are only getting worse.” The typical answer “the white man is taking away” blah blah. I never believe that narrative so 1996 a young 15 year old turned away from the Democratic Party and I became a never democrat. I jokingly today say I am the blueprint to Lady Candace Owens Blexit. I grew up watching lots of Malcolm X speeches and the speech Ballot or the bullet really hits home to where I politically stand. I am neither a democrat or a republican though as stated I became a never democrat some believe that it instantly means I’m a republican but I am not. 2016 was the first I’ve ever voted. Some would ask why haven’t I voted before then and the answer is simple. I like to vote for those I feel are true to their word, one that doesn’t feel like they are just saying things for votes. I’ve also became outcasted by family and my community losing my “black card” when I didn’t vote for Obama. Lots of blacks people voted for him because he was black and not his policies, if there were any. The blessings being born in New York in the ghetto is that you are always around con artist and swindlers so you become pretty able to point out who is who and Obama was a dividing con artist. So, 2016 was my first time voting and I went with trump. Not because I though he was this great and awesome hero that some people see him as but the fact that he was different and he doesn’t sugar coat things. When he talks I completely understands where he’s going, what he’s trying to explain and so on. I know he isn’t perfect but he was better than Clinton. Kind of wish he lays long on Twitter but other than that he’s not the super racist monster the media says he is. Any who I was invited here because I was recently banned from a group for expressing a difference of an opinion. As a black man I’m not on board with BLM and the narrative they push and I stated that whole debunking some of the lies they push. Because I made my statement while taking heavy assaults from members on that group whose claiming I am not black￼ because how I talk and what not. The group administrators slapped a hate speech on my and banned me. Having difference of opinion is hate speech is interesting to know. I don’t hide or filter out my opinion because you may not like it. I will state my opinion and leave it be. I don’t care about this cancel culture or being hated on or being banned on social media. I won’t be silenced by anyone and never will. The whole thing on debating is expressing ideals and opinions to one another and not to bend the knee to an overlord. Welp I’ve said a lot. Again thanks for the add and I’ll be here often.",0
"I’m a little late on posting...I needed a little time to think about what I wanted to say. I’m a #WalkWith and was referred to this group by my older sister; thank you sister Bobbie ♥️. I’m the spouse of a local police Officer and am so scared of what’s happening to our beloved country, states, and cities; never thought I’d see this in my lifetime 😐. I’m seriously afraid for what the future holds for my two daughters if we don’t regain some sort of control the current state of affairs. I would like to say thank you for starting this group; it’s so refreshing to hear your positive stories, as well as your trials and tribulations. This is the way communication is supposed to work and how all social media should be! Many many thanks & blessings to you all!♥️",NA
I don't know how many people are going to read this but I am 23 and I am a walkwith I grew up in the Detroit area and my life has been filled with setbacks I was pulled out of school in the third grade and I was never taught anything till I turned 18 and enrolled myself back in school. I became orphaned at the age of 14 and I was not placed in the system I just drifted for lack of a better term. I graduated at the age of 22 which honestly hurts because I am 4 years behind my peers but it is what it is after being out of school for a literal decade I went back and got my high school diploma and I will be attending college in the winter to become a teacher. These things (not me going to school and succeeding) are because of the running of the democratic party in intercitys and our school systems its abhorrent what the dems have done and are doing to this country and something needs to change I voted for trump 4 years ago and I will again! And if you have read this far thank you for caring,0
"My Name is Katherine, and I am embarrassed to admit that I supported Obama...most of my immigrant family did. We believed that Democrats supported Immigrants, that they were the party that protected minorities. Trump running for President was a joke to everyone around me, I on the other hand was curious. The truth is that during Obama’s last years the direction this country was taking reminded me of my Communist birth country. Like Obama our government promised free healthcare, equality for everyone..but it came at a cost to those who worked hard to make a better life. My father lost his house, his bank accounts, and his car, one day they showed up and took our whole life away. We found ourselves like the people in Venezuela making long lines to try and get some food. I did not want America to become like that. Trump was being blunt and honest. He was not afraid to say the things that many of us were feeling. I decided to come out to my family on a Facebook post. The outcome was to be expected. I lost family members, they thought I was a traitor. My poor mother found herself fighting her sisters to protect me. I explained to everyone that my loyalty was not to party but to America and what was best for the country. Fast forward to today, I have managed to turn most of my family Republican!! Everyone that I love will be voting for Trump in 2020, now it was not easy but I was relentless Lol President Trump has made us proud to be American Citizens, he is the reason we are finally free from the lies that Democrats sold us!! Thank you for letting me share, may God give us another win this November!!",0
I have never considered myself Democratic or a Republican..... But Democratic's have shown me without a doubt I’m a Republican Trump2020 🇺🇸 Edit: thank you all so much it feels so good to say how I feel and not be attacked!!!!!

"I've voted back and forth, all depending on if I believe what they say. Yes I voted obama the first go round, I honestly believed he would make a great and wonderful change, he is make a change, wasnt great and certainly not wonderful, his second term I did not vote for him. 2016 choice between trump and hillary I took the lesser of two evils and have thanked god ever since. I want my country back, I want peace back. I will be voting trump again, knowing that it wont immediately bring peace back, but knowing that ny voting trump it will help to point us in the right direction.",1
"I've never been interested in politics until Trump ran in 2016. I'm a registered democrat but could not vote for Hilary Clinton. I live in a blue state so I knew my vote for Trump didn't matter, but after a quick prayer asking to choose the better candidate, I voted for Trump. I actually cried when I left the voting booth. It really wasn't until the Kavanaugh fiasco & Christine Blaze Ford surfaced from the underground had I paid more attention to the behavior and actions of the democratic party. The behavior from the left at this time was appalling: yelling at members of congress in restaurants, standing outside their homes in groups in the middle of the night, cornering congressmen in the elevators and breaking into an office to steal private information including addresses of those in the republican committees were just a few examples. I had seen enough to know exactly what was going on. Sooner or later, common sense kicks in & you realize you are being played by the democrats. Even the #Metoo movement was in full force, never to be seen with Joe Biden's latest allegation. Hypocrisy in full force. Then there was the whole Russia collusion, Ukraine Collusion and the Impeachment process. I followed all of it! Me! The democrats have worked tirelessly to divide this great county and have been willing to pull out all the tricks to persuade people that our president is evil. Honestly, Donald Trump has his weaknesses and faults but what I have witnessed with my own eyes coming from the democrats is far more evil than the actions of Trump & his administration. I've watched CNN & MSNBC news and have felt only anxiousness and depression from those media outlets then turned to FOX news and felt more uplifting, more hopeful, more energetic. More informed. I now view the news through a whole new lens. I can honestly see why people hate our president after watching CNN and MSNBC. They treat him like he is SATAN. I myself have heard with my own ears how the left had twisted Trump's words on their outlets. ""Wait, he didn't say it that way!"" I've followed the Trump administration's accomplishments, policies and other changes made and honestly, my policies and morals align more with the republican side. I don't even recognize the left any longer. The chaos on the streets and lawlessness in some of these democratic run cities is enough to turn your stomach. How can anyone approve of this behavior? It's blatantly obvious that the democrats don't even want to acknowledge it. How can anyone vote for defunding the police? How can anyone not make the safety of this country and the citizens living in it a priority? Didn't these members of congress take an oath to keep their citizens safe? I voted for Trump in 2016 but I really walked away in 2018. If it were not for Trump, I would still have my head in the sand & remain clueless about the corruption that lies within the democratic party. I will continue to vote Republican no matter if my vote makes a difference or not. Praying for peace, our country, and our republican party.",0
I just joined and this is the first time I am voting this year. I am voting straight republican! And I just joined to empower everyone on here! I absolutely love everyone's story here. Amazing on the turn around. I would love to share some stories on here as I have friends that just vote democrat because of skin color or how they were raised without knowing anything about the party. My parents are republican but I never understood anything. So I'm on here to be empowered and give empower to everyone on here. God bless each of y'all! 🇺🇸♥️💪,NA
"True story.. I remember back in '03 when I was still in elementary school at Fort Riley Elementary in Fort Riley KS.. asking my teacher who the man in the picture was that was hung in front of our classroom above the classroom clock. It was George w Bush and my teacher told me that the #Republican party were evil and not for me.. She said, I should always vote #Democrat since we're not rich and voting Rebpulican only helps the rich. I've always been a democrat with no solid reason since then and cheered when Barack Obama became our president. I had no solid reason nor did I know anything about politics but yet I chose to be a Democrat. I believe this happened because I was told what to believe and who to side with from adolescence. Fast forward to now, where I'm 27 and doing well for myself.. I will never vote blue ever again.. Nobody is perfect but I believe Donald Trump is the best president we've had in a while. You can nit pick about all the things this man has done wrong sure... but before you put him in a pedestal of judgement, put Obama in the same pedastal. I'm always going to stand up for what's right and this whole #trumpsyndrome that the Democrats have for Donald Trump is childish and wrong. The William barr hearing was a total joke.. The man never got to answer their close ended question! ""Will you continue to beat your wife? Yes or No?"" ""Well, I never.."" ""I""M RECLAIMING MY TIME, ANSWER YES OR NO"" Go Mr. President Donald Trump . I support you as an Asian American immogrant! You are a real warrior going through what you are going through and still persistently fighting the ""mob"". #MAGA2020 I really don't want to argue on here on comments. If you feel like I said anything to the point where you can't be friends with me, then go ahead and delete me. I've been ok with left leaning people posting political posts and if I can't do the same without you getting angry and heated, then I'm ok with us not being friends.",1
"I have been in this group for a couple months. I am a #WalkAway. I joined this group because that's just what I did. Some time in the past couple months I realised just how hateful the democratic party really is-the things they condon will ruin this country. I grew up with republican parents. My dad had a strict work ethic he instilled in his children. He also believed the man works hard to provide for his family. So when I ended up in a very abusive relationship he told me to stay in it because my husband loved worked really hard and took care of me, but in reality he spent all his money on drugs. This attitude caused me to believe that the Republican party was evil-consumed with money and not caring for the little guy. Without the help of my family, it took awhile to get out of that abusive relationship and when I did I ended up in the welfare system and in low income housing. I had 3 children and no work experience or childcare. The money from welfare was not enough to take care of my family. Often times we went hungry. Many times the electricity would be shut off for nonpayment. My son only had 2 pairs of pants and if his shoes fell apart in the middle of the month, they got duct taped. I always voted Democrat thinking they were the ones who would change all that, while the Republicans would take away what little I had . Eventually I got tired of the situation. It was no way to raise a family. I still couldn't secure a job so I went to college and got a degree in liberal arts. With that degree, I secured a well paying job working for the welfare office! But again, I was in a job that was dependent on democratic ideas. So I spent the next 15 years voting democrat. It wasn't until the government shut down that I started opening my eyes to what democrats were really about. All the crazy things they do for power. The rioting put me over the top. No longer can I support a party that condones such behavior. I recognise the work ethic my republican father had instilled in me and in that hard work is the road to success. I don't care that my job depends on democratic ideas anymore. If they want to tear down the welfare system, so be it. I can not condone the actions of the Democratic party, they all need to be taken out of office and make way for a new system of government. I walk away. Due to my job being so democratticaly inclined, I can not be out spoken in my views. Nor with my bi-racial family who support BLM. I am the silent magority. Come November, hear me roar!",0
"I think this page leans more towards walking away from democrat. Though I have some democrat tendencies, up until 2016 I had always been a registered Independent. Was really not one for politics. I voted independent for the very reason to tell politicians they couldn't sway me and or involve me. And I had always been very neutral about things -- maybe moderately hanging right or moderately hanging left on somethings. And no president personally affected me until Obama. For years and years I scrambled to make 17-19k a year. I could be comfortable, but it was literally check to check. But I was okay with it. Then the individual mandate came. Now, during holiday times, a lot of my work shut down for 3 weeks and I would recoup losses with my measly 500-600 return. Of course making what I did, health insurance was out of the question. So one year I got like 200 back and it put me in a world of hell. I lost 32lbs from from lack of money for food and necessities. My tax preparer explained that there was a new fine on your tax return for not being able to afford health insurance. I was like, that's ass backwards. Why? Who did that? And then... Down the rabbit hole I went. Obama. Only president to attack my actual well being and survival. I was so against this that I said, okay, you have my attention and now you have a vote against you. This force into politics has changed me Republican until there is substantial proof Democrats go moderate again. And then I may be back to Independent. Not sure if this story counts, but I did change parties for the betterment of Americans.",1
"Peace be upon you all. I'm an American-born Muslim; my maternal grandmother was a Cherokee. I walk with. I've always been conservative; most Muslims are by nature. However, most Muslims in the USA have been herded into the liberal camp, largely because they felt betrayed after voting for the NWO Bush family. The Democrats only pretend to embrace the Muslim community. But Obama actually dropped way more bombs on Muslim women and children than either Bush did. And the liberals don't actually respect our traditional gender roles, modesty, or family values; they merely want our votes and obedience. Snakes like Ilhan Omar claim to represent the Muslim community, but they are total imposters. Ilhan isn't qualified to represent Muslims, or the American people. I'm sure many of you reading this don't have good feelings about Muslims, or Islam. But I understand your feelings and concerns. There is, for lack of better words, a satanic cult of hypocrites masquerading as Muslims. But I assure you that they also masquerade as Christians and Jews too. Many of you Christians may be surprised to learn that Muslims actually do believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, and we believe he will return to this world in the flesh. You're all welcome to probe me with all the tough questions about Islam that you can possibly think of. I feel much more at ease in the presence of conservative and Christian America, than I do in the presence of godless liberal America. I love America, I love the God of Abraham and Jesus Christ, and pray for President Trump to be divinely guided.",1
"Thanks for recommending me to this group Mecinda! I scanned through and read other testimonials and it inspired me to sit and think about how far I've actually came in educating myself. I would say I started out as more of a ""follower"", I listened and believed the main stream media and Hollywood elites, but I had never voted. It was about 7 years into George Bushs term that I feel I ""woke up"". I had just moved to a new state, had newborn twin boys. I hardly knew anyone and stayed home a lot. I started watching the Glenn Beck show on Fox. That man woke ME UP, he was fearless in a time where we didn't have that at the time and he would give you the history and facts for you to form your own opinion, He'd always tell you to please go check this for yourself, to not go off his words. Ive come so far in my own opinions that I don't always agree with him now 😆 but he trailed the way for the Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro, Crowder, Milo's of today! I'm loving seeing my loved ones walk this walk WITH me finally! My biggest thing is, speak UP and facts over feelings always wins! #lookbehindthecurtaindorothy 💜💜",0
"I literally felt like crying reading everyone’s stories today.. the bravery, honesty and patriotism PROFOUNDLY touched my heart.. I am a #walkwith but consider myself part of the “silent majority” My husbands family came from Cuba.. and he is bit a more outspoken than me. I love this country and cry when I hear Lee Greenwood’s song “God Bless The USA”... every.single.time. I have found everyone’s COURAGE here inspiring. I recently told my husband that I didn’t want to put a Trump sign in the yard or in my car because I fear for my safety- our family’s safety. It’s s sad day when you are afraid to show your support out of fear of physical harm and retaliation! I believe I’m finding the encouragement here to find my voice ... ALL of you that have changed your mindset are to be honored... Changing your whole perception is difficult and life changing! I am blessed to have been taught by a family to honor our country and be respectful of all people... I am a moderate when it comes to social issues (even a little left-sided) ... but I’m a fiscal conservative and believer in the constitution! For those people with a louder voice than some of us..know us quiet ones will still have your back ❤️",NA
I was raised a democrat and for years I was so stupid. I voted for Trump and will do do again. The democrat party has turned into nothing but a hate group nothing short of them being called the communist party. How can anyone be so filled with so much hate I’ll never figure that one out. I hope more people will see the light soon.,NA
"Thanks for accepting me into the group! As for me I’ve always been conservative, although I’ll admit that I haven’t always liked some of the candidates I’ve had to vote for. As my mother would say I wasn’t so much voting FOR a candidate as I was voting AGAINST the other. In 2016 it was pretty much the same story. I wasn’t real excited to vote for Trump. After all he is and always has been a pretty polarizing character. However in this past four years he has accomplished so very incredible changes, often without the support of many, if not in some cases most, of the members of his own party! I truly believe he has this nations best interests at heart. I’ll have no problem walking into the polling place, showing my ID, and voting for him this time! I very much believe this may be the most important election of my lifetime. It is so hard to believe just how far the radical left, with their newspeak media and social media outlets, are willing to go to steel this election. To all of you #WalkAway’s in this group I would just like to say that I truly admire your courage! As for myself, I would never expect anyone to change ALL of their views on the issues that face us today just to be a part of a group like this or a political party. The only views I would hope anyone would want to change would be those that they have discovered are based on false information. Unfortunately the left has really become quite the propaganda machine. To everyone here, may God bless you and don’t forget to vote!!!",1
"I’ve been a Patriot to this country my whole life. More so when my brother enlisted in the Marine Corp at 18 years old to fight in Iraq. One of the first things he ever said to me when I was able to talk to him the first time was this. “Turn off the news. We’re doing great things here they aren’t showing you, sure there’s terrible fighting but most of our work is humanitarian. We are building orphanages, making friends. These people don’t want this life anymore than we do” At the time we had our TV’s on 24/7, on a loop. My eyes were opened in 2004 during that call. He said “We are just chess pieces in a very big game where only the evil win” I couldn’t accept that. So because of research and the love I have for my country I started to learn. To research. To see what’s really going on. I’m a WalkWith because I know the WalkAways need support and we are here for them....the surface media, agenda etc. has corrupted our Great Country long enough! It’s refreshing to see our Country ALIVE again! Love you all 🇺🇸❤️🤍💙🇺🇸 Edit: I forgot to mention the most important thing! These pics are from a recent trip the President made to our small town in Marinette, WI where he helped secure a naval contract to our shipyard that will allow more than 1000 jobs to the area. I’m a business owner and the Presidential Motorcade drove right past our shop front. Very proud to be able to say I was part of this.

"I was just called a racist about five minutes ago. So here’s a post from my personal page that I wrote recently because I “came out” as a conservative. “YOU’RE RACIST THEN!” -No, honey. That’s not how any of this works. I am half Japanese. I am European & have Indigenous roots. My child is Hispanic (Mexican & Central American), Asian, White..... I am damn proud of that collective heritage. “GO BACK TO MEXICO THEN!! YOUR LAST NAME IS GUTIERREZ!” -I’m not Hispanic by blood (married to a Gutierrez), but hey I’d love to be back in Baja right now. Fish tacos & off-shore winds, anyone?! “YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU ARE THE DEFINITION OF WHITE PRIVILEGE!” -White privilege? Me? I come from a Japanese mother who came to the United States as a missionary with ZERO DOLLARS to her name. My American father worked his ass off for every penny in his name. ZERO INHERITANCE and ZERO PRIVILEGES because of his skin color. He worked harder and continues to work harder than all of you whiny assess combined. I work for what I have. Try weaning yourself off of endless unemployment checks and start working. If you put half the amount of effort into building a future for yourself instead of whining, maybe you could take a look at yourself & be proud of what you’re doing with your own life... Try again. #WalkAwayCampaign🇺🇸",1
"I’ve been apart of this group and never shared my story . I’m 59 and was raised in a Democrat family . Thinking it was blue collared working party . So I did vote for Obama, thinking he would change things . I was right he sure did . He divided us , he chose what he thought was more important to address and putting targets on our police officers backs . Bad people do bad things and of course I know that but his sneaky underlying agendas WOKE me to pay attention. Now you have seen the events that have taken place were put in place by this man . The Democratic Party never expected Our President to win . So the story keeps unfolding . I’m so happy and tell many about this group because I feel as though I’m not alone here .

Thankful as an American to walk with all of you patriots. It gives me hope for our nation. It is scary right now and as a almost 67 year old Grandmother I worry about the future for my grandchildren.

Here’s my story my dad and cousin served in Vietnam my parents were lifelong democrats and I followed in my parents footsteps it was very different then I am a U.S.Army Veteran I proudly served my country since 2008 I have seen our country being attacked by various groups and recently two in particular that are nothing more than terrorist I voted for Trump in 2016 I watch him be attacked for the last four years and continued to move forward and brought jobs back to America and got rid of Nafta that disastrous trade agreement that detroyed American jobs he just signed a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that enhances jobs here he has been great for America Democrats hate him because he wants to drain the swamp and hopefully that will happen this year I proudly changed my party affiliation this year to republican my family was always conservative and I am proud to be a new member of #WalkAwayCampaign,0
"I was born In the Philippines and moved to California at the age of 3z I only knew how to be a democrat and didn’t know better. Obama screwed with my healthcare. He promised I could keep seeing the same doctor. But that was a lie. Furthermore, the quality of my shoes started going to shit that’s when I found out that it was because he started shipping jobs overseas. I hated him. But I didn’t like the republicans Either because how they were portrayed by the media. When Trump ran for office I had to do my own research. And after listening to him speak. I realized I have the same core values as he does. I became a US citizen 3 years ago. And I’m so proud and grateful to live in this country. This year I will vote for Trump. #KAG love from Vegas.",0
"Omg...its about time...i was getting my mind ready to start something similar but glad I found this group. There are so many people out there that feel the same way but need to get a bit more organized into one group. There are some older people who are so upset by whats going on that they can't even talk about it. When I first saw everything going on with all these changes over the years I couldnt believe my ears...and to think I voted Obama because I thought he stood for something great for my child.. she is mix. It shouldn't matter what color you are as long as the government works for all. Im 53 and when I realized the full scope of what was going on I was disheartened, disappointed and trautmatized. I literally was crying every day for the hurt everyone is putting themselves through needlessly...its time to stop the madness...and get with a program that works for all. No more bullying, hatefulness, and endless rioting. Protesting is one thing rioting is different and ppl need to learn the difference..",0

All ages, all socio-economic backgrounds. Waking up. Understanding the lies we have been told by Democrats, liberals, SJW’s. NONE of which is true. None of which divides us. Want to see TRUE diversity and inclusion? HERE it is. Right in front of your very eyes! And the magic continues: with these thousands of walkaways testifying that only conservatism and some sort of America first patriotic approach for ALL Americans, again, regardless of background and self-identification, will bring us forward as a whole and as one.

"#WalkWith!! I have voted Republican since my mid 20's. I only became more vocal in my political views over 4 years ago. I could see how our Country was deteriorating under Obama. I was so glad to get on the Trump Train!!🇺🇲🇺🇸 I love that he is not a Politician, but a true American, and for the American people. It is so sad to see such chaos, destruction happening with the left's agenda. Liberalism is the disease, the Virus!! I'm a proud American, not afraid to speak and I'm not afraid to die for our Country. Keep America Great!! God Bless All🇺🇲🇺🇲🙏🙏",1

I have loved this group and reading all the stories. I love the diversity of the group. I have been hesitant to tell my story fearing I could not find the right words. I grew up in a Democrat family. My mom is still a strong liberal Democrat. My dad was a US Steel Worker and went on strike in the 80’s. They ended up closing the Texas Steel Mill and he lost his job and retirement. He blamed Reagan and I believed him. I voted Straight Ticket Democrat from age 18 -41. I talked to people in my worldly travels and learned that our country was moving in the wrong direction. Hearing an Aunt I visited while in Germany talk about her childhood under Hitler woke me up. She told me that they did not have the freedom of speech in their own homes among their family members in private. They feared Hitler would learn what they talked about. They lived in fear. I choose not to elect anyone who will support that mentality. I voted against Obama and now vote straight ticket Republican. I should have never trusted the Democratic Party. I have walked away from the Democrat party!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,0
"Walked away 12 years ago. Tired of all the lies. TRUMP 2020 Wow is all I can say, this group is simply amazing. All day I’ve been reading true patriot stories of Americans paths. I’ve loved each one to. My family was also Democrats born and bread. My great uncle was in a car accident when he was an infant and at 70 years old it gave him the mentality of a eight year old. We use to go on walks and he’d look at a house and so their Republican. I told him uncle you can say that shows bias’s. He has since passed on. I’ve got to say I have never regret my choice to become a Republican. You all give me hope that our great nation is not lost. Thank you for the inspiration and the invitation to Keep America Great.",0

"I was born and raised in Jersey City......Democrat run.....Democrat family......After I got married and started having kids, I moved away from Jersey City for better schools and better neighborhood for my children......I went to college and was able to get my degree in education.......So, as I got older, wiser, and more educated, I left the Democratic Party and became an independent.......Then, Obama became president.....I hated his polices and started voting straight RED because the Democrats were going left......In November, I will be voting straight RED to Remove Every Democrat.....re-elect Donald Trump and stop the insanity that is going on in MY country.",0
"#WalkAway I grew up fighting against everything my Republican supporting father said. I believed in all the lies that the media spun. I was young and impressionable. I couldn't stand the sound or look of Trump. Until my husband put on one of his speeches. It was then, that I heard for myself that his words were taken out of context and spun to fit the Democratic narrative. I started researching. The more I dug up, the more I saw the lies and the truths!! Never stop questioning!",0
Raised Democrat and walking away because I’m tired of the party wasting time and taxpayer money doing everything they can to go against our President instead of doing their jobs and working with the President!,0
Probably not too exciting here. I am a #walkwith. 44 and the first time I voted was 2016. I voted for Trump and so very glad I did. Cannot wait to stand in line for 2020 election. We live in a small town in Colorado and Polis is almost chasing us out of here. I thought we would be safe here. Let's see how the next few years go. Anyways I will vote all Republican and I am praying that what I see on this page is the true majority of America. I am scared but I will stand strong. This is my newest purchase.,1
53yo from Philadelphia - the Democratic Party has been hijacked by the radical left. I admit when I voted for Trump in the last election I was scared that I would regret my choice. However I could not in good conscience vote for that criminal HRC. I have never regretted my vote for DJT for a second. I stand even firmer in my choice to vote DJT in for a second term come November. The radical left is on a quest to destroy America. DRAIN THE SWAMP. If Biden wins our future will be bleak. #MAGA #Trump2020 ❤️🙏🏼✝️🇺🇸,NA
"I'm 47 and I am a #walkaway. The first time I decided to vote I registered as a Democrat and voted for Al Gore. I voted straight Democrat from that time forward believing they were the party that cared about the people. Even though I voted for Obama, my mind began to change after the Ferguson shooting and President Obama used that as a way to completely divide the nation instead of showing support for unity. One day I stumbled across the Ben Shapiro Show podcast and I started doing my homework. It's evident that Democrats run the big cities and they are failing miserably with homelessness, high crime, terrible schools, high taxes and expensive housing and they would like to do this for the whole country. I registered as an Independent in 2016. I didn't vote for Hillary because of her corruption. Not sure about Trump yet, I didn't vote for him either. Since he has been President it is evident that he really cares about America's success and that means we all succeed. It is disgusting the way the Democrats are trying to destroy our country for no other reason than pure Trump hatred. For that reason alone I will vote Trump 2020. I will not support a party that thinks rioting, looting, burning down businesses, injuring and killing people is ok.",0
"**Please do not share** Ok Thank you for accepting me. I have never ever voted before. In 2016, I was glad that Trump won, because he was the “lesser of two evils”. Now, after seeing what he has done for our country in what time he has had, you best believe I will be casting, my first ever vote, Republican, this year.",NA

"I was raised in upstate NY, and had always admired JFK. Being in a predominantly Democratic environment was normal, and had not realized that I had sided with the Republican principals since I was a teenager. In the late 80s I was shunned and scolded by my very Democratic Aunt, when I had mentioned that I really enjoyed listening to Rush Limbaugh's late night talk show. It was quite hurtful the way she presented her very ugly opinion. In my juvanile ignorance I really did not understand her hatred for the man. My relationship with her was forever soured. 1992 I didn't vote, but I was routing for Clinton. 2000 I voted for Gore. There was just something evil about Bush that didn't sit right with me...to my surprise, my wierd intuition was proven correct in 2014. I didnt vote again until 2016. Fast forward 2014, still holding a Democrat affiliation; stumbled upon some video documentaries on youtube while killing my boredom, stationed in Germany. The wrecking havoc of emotional torment that raced through my body was worse than what a person feels when they find out thier spouse has cheated. I was floored, pissed off and devastated. I chose at that point, I was no longer going to push for promotion or retirement from the military. I did my time honorably and was released 2015. I returned home to my confused Democratic mother, and very Conservative step father, to re-establish my new civilian life. When Trump announced his running, I was whooting and hollering like a touchdown was made, I didnt care what party he was running under. I'll never forget the look on my moms face, (a little shocked, but inquisitive) and the toothy smile on my step dads face when I answered her tactful question... ""Really? You think he has what it takes?"" My response: ""He's perfect! He can't be bought."" ...fast forward 2018, my very liberal sister snarked a question: ""Since when did mom turn into a Trump loving conservative?""...my response: ""When she became out numbered."" ...Our relationship has never been the same...blood may be thicker than water; but I'm not a hungry vampire.",
"Cheers Brandon!!! Since joining this wonderful family of concerned and patriotic Americans I've enjoyed hundreds of testimonials on the various symptoms of the DEM-20 virus. This won't measure up to their spectacular stories. I grew up in the era of 'Leave It To Beaver' and moved yearly to new states. I attended 17 different schools before I failed to graduate from high school. My mother was a proud server back when it was called ""waitress"" and worked at the most prestigious restaurants. She was a hard-working prosperous democrat, with an 8th grade education fearless and compassionate. While married, she raised three respectful and intelligent young boys pretty much alone. [Well, two out of three ain't bad!] When we moved to Anniston, AL I was stunned to see Democrat racism up close and personal. I'd heard the N-word (rarely) before, but to my shock, in mid-60's Alabama, it was a frequent pronoun. Fortunately, we left that in the rear view of our worn '58 Olds Vista Cruiser. I don't know if my step-father had a political affiliation. He was always just lurking in the background poised like a hungry dingo. But, I prospered under my Democrat mom and grew into a faithful follower of Brother John Kennedy. Thanks to the GI bill, I finally graduated from high school when I was a senior in college. I was SO very lucky to be able to do that as it changed my life forever. I reject anyone's thanks for my service because I'm forever indebted to my country and the U.S. Army; a debt I will never be able to fully repay. College also allowed me to escape at least part of the circus that was the Carter administration. As a husband, a father, and an entrepreneur) I continued to spread the liberal virus faithfully. My dogs were democrats. My talking African Gray Parrot, named ""Smokey"" even had a few choice words for those who dared use the word ""Republican"" within earshot. By the end of the Carter administration my 17-5/8% mortgage, both double-digit unemployment and inflation had me somewhat disenchanted with the Democrats and the Iran hostage fiasco. The 5-year delay between HS and college gifted me with a more global vision. I saw the hideous hand of two communist countries at war with their own people. Vietnam and Korea were radically different countries and cultures, but they shared a common enemy. One prevailed with our help and the other failed when our political resolve dissipated. I watched in sorrow at the disparity that soon emerged between the two Asian countries. So I bit my tongue and crossed my fingers when Ray-Gun Ronnie was elected. (It's hard to shake a stage-4 Democrat virus.) I'm ashamed to say I never voted for the man that would (arguably) become the greatest president in my lifetime (45 has a real shot). Listening to the news for the next 8 years was hard on my beloved bird, Smokey. Sometimes I wonder if that's why he flew out the door one day and never returned. I was able to get back on the Democrat mule with Clinton. That silver-tongue and charisma was a thing of beauty in the early years. After his second inaugural speech I opened a bottle of wine and sat down with a smile. My wife sat down beside me, and asked, ""What did he say?"" I Formulated my thoughts as I poured her a glass... and said, ""He talked about... you know, big things, making a real difference, our rich texture, and thriving economies, and... and... You know what? He said bupkis!"" The next morning I read his speech in the NYT. I was right. Absent charisma, it was a hollow fog-horn in the distance. I had placed my precious vote directly into the shredder. Suddenly casting about, un-moored, I felt like Tom Hanks frantically searching for the soccer ball he called, 'Wilson'. The Kennedy Democrats were long gone. Reagan had actually brought down the Berlin wall by punking the Ruskies with that ""Star Wars"" rope-a-dope, and I got a new mortgage at 6.25%. But... but... the GOP were rich people not my people! Right? It was hard to argue with my paycheck. I'll avoid going off in or on the Bushes, except to say, I watched live 9/11 in absolute horror. Apparently even W has forgotten that infamous day. I will NEVER forget it. I will also never forget the assassinations of both Kennedys and MLK, and the day in April, 1974 when the last Americans left Vietnam, airlifted in panic mode, while leaving hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to be murdered by their own government... those days are etched in my brain like tombstones on Boothill. Fast forward to 2008. FINALLY! A Democrat I can get behind. His inexperience was lacking, but Obama exuded the Clinton charm (that should have set off the klaxons). Within 90 days of his inaugural speech (dubiously Clinton-ish), I knew I had made a horrible mistake. He was denigrating MY country all over the world! He was airing not only our dirty laundry in foreign countries, but right at home in 'the People's House'! Damn! Another precious vote shredded. ""Wilson? WILSON!!!"" Where the hell is Wilson (truncated)",
"Someone told me to join this group, I am glad I did. I won’t make my story long but rather short and sweet. I am 25 years old, Christian, always been brainwashed and taught by television and my peers that the Democrats are really for us as African-Americans and brainwashed to believe that only racists or the rich joined the Republican party. I strongly opposed Trump because growing up in my inner city, everyone admired Obama and said Trump hates our kind. Even though I never got deep into politics, but rather went with the wave of what others and the media had to say about Trump (thats why researching on your own is important). I didn’t get my wake up call until God gave me a vision as a Christian woman of Donald Trump. I believe God had enough of me opposing Trump because he is using him mightily. In my vision, I was surrounded by popular Democrat leaders and the presence felt evil and malicious. Donald Trump came into the room and protected me from them by giving me a hug. After receiving that vision from Jesus, thats when God spoke and said he is using him mightily. This vision happened a while back during the coronavirus hype. So it definitely was the perfect timing to receive it. If I had gotten this vision before COVID, I would’ve shrugged it off and continued to listen to the leftist media. I knew something was up when I saw how Trump was going hard against Bill Gates/Dr. Fauci, how they was blaming him for everything, how Trump was saving our meat plants from being shut down, cut off the World Health Organization, and was promoting a medicine that was proven to be effective by medical doctors and peoples testimonies. He was doing things I agreed with and then I saw how he was never called a racist until he ran. After God gave me the vision, I started to proudly declare my support for him on Facebook by posting a photo of me wearing a MAGA hat for the first time. I received the most evil hate mail and stalking ever. I had individuals stalking me on my messages for days saying I was a coon or a Uncle Tom, think that I am white and it was really bad I was considering of contacting the police cause one girl was stalking me on here sending me evil messages. Honestly joining the Republican party was the best decision, they are wayyy more welcoming then the Libs! Honestly, I have experienced more from my own then from others, me coming out as a Trump supporter proved it. EDIT: wow! I have received 25K likes now! Thank you so much to your love and positivity! This has truly made my week! Jesus bless you all!",
"Hello and thanks for the add. I apologize ahead of time if I go off the rails in different directions, but I am so angry with the democrats, the people who refuse to look at any viewpoint other than their own, which hasn't been researched, and the MSM that my thoughts are just all over the place. Im a registered democrat only because I truly didn't know the difference at the time of registration. I'm older and, believe it or not, there was a time in history where the party lines were not as clearly drawn as they are now. I've always voted based on the candidate I felt was best regardless of afffiliation. Then along came the internet and the evolvement of actual news reporting that told the other side of the story. The side the corrupt politicians and media outlets didn't want us to know about or be able to prove. The more I dig, the sicker I get seeing just how corrupt some of these people are. I voted for Trump in 2016 and will definitely vote for him again. The more I read, watch and research, the more convinced I become that he is the only one who cares about the citizens of this country. I'm not sure who I get angrier with, the democrats or the biased media. I was watching a news report on CBS a couple days ago and they were talking about how Twitter partially suspended Donald Trump, Jr's account because he shared that video of the Frontline doctors talking about HCQ. The reporter said his account had been suspended ""for sharing a video that contained information about HCQ being helpful in treating covid. Which is false information and against Twitter's rules"" (not verbatim but close). I wanted to jump thru the tv. She unequivocally stated it was false information. Not that Twitter was saying it was false. I couldn't believe they let a reporter say that. I think of how many people I know who would never check that statement. They'd just take it as fact. She's not a doctor, but because she's on the evening news, it has to be true right? It's the sneaky little things like this that get me boiling. My mom is almost 80 and she doesn't know how to fact check things so she believes everything the MSM says. I am constantly having to explain things to her. Another example is a commercial that says Senator Tillis is all for restaurant employees not washing their hands. Yes he did say that but it was taken out of context from a conversation in 2010 about government regulations. He said ""as long as the restaurant posted a sign saying they didn't require their employees to wash their hands and the problem would take care of itself real soon"". But how many people out there are like my mom or others that aren't computer savvy and can't or won't look up the facts? It's so infuriating.",
"I just recently started following #WalkAway. My friend, Margo suggested it for me to see that there are people who have seen the light. I have been voting Republican for 50 years. My #1 reason is that I don’t believe in abortion. Have had a few wonderful experiences in this party. The best was attending a small luncheon with Ronald Regan. Trump wasn’t my choice in 2016, but when he became the nominee I was 100% behind him. Never have I seen a man work as hard as he does for our country. Trump 2020 for America.",
"I've been hanging around for a couple of weeks now and after reading all your posts I feel like it's time to share. I am from the beautiful, but very blue, state of Washington; born and raised. Grew up in a small town. My folks were Republican, but when I registered to vote I registered as an Independent. I voted for President Trump in 2016 because I didn't trust Hillary - so glad I did. Jump forward to 2017. My son was active duty Army, severely injured in Afghanistan. I had concerns about the medical care he was getting post injury and worried for his safety (as many of you know suicide is a big issue for our soldiers and veterans who suffer from PTSD and TBI's). I wasn't sure what to do to help him, but knew I couldn't just sit back and watch him implode and do nothing..... I couldn't live with myself if he would have injured himself. So..... I started sending emails. It was a Sunday afternoon. I sent out almost 30 emails that day to Washington state senators, representatives among others; one of which was to our dear President Trump. I texted my son to ask him a question on Monday morning and he told me there was ""a lot"" going on and he would call me back. I ask if I had created a tidal wave and he said - ""no Mom, you created a Tsunami"". None of the Washington state senators or representatives EVER reached out to me; but President Trump did. He CARED about my battle wounded son and rattled cages to get him the care he desperately needed and deserved. I truly believe that he saved my son's life from suicide and I will be eternally grateful to our President for what he did. I have never been very political, like many of you, until all this chaos started. I told my husband, the Democrats are willing to take our amazing county down by starting a race war, just to defeat President Trump!!! This is crazy.... My roots go deep in the United States of America. My family came over on the Mayflower and Abraham Lincoln is my 2nd cousin, 5 times removed. I am a Patriot and I refuse to let this country go to hell without a fight!!!!",
"Hello friends, here is my story. I grew up in a family where we didn't talk much politics and that was ok with me. I didn't really know if my parents were democrats or republicans. When I was in high school I took an International Relations course right smack dab in the middle of Operation Desert Storm. I became obsessed with the news and absorbing everything about the conflict. I watched President Bush act with such wisdom and patriotism that I was so proud of him. The first presidential election I was able to vote in was Bush vs. Clinton. I committed myself to be educated about both platforms and listen to all of the interviews and debates. When my dad asked why I was going to vote for President Bush I told him because it just felt like everything that was coming out of Clinton's mouth was a lie (boy was I way ahead of the curve on that LOL). With that I campaigned hard for President Bush's reelection and immersed myself in politics. Of course he lost but I will never forget how patriotic his presidency made me feel. Fast forward to 9/11 and the next President Bush and again I was so amazed at how he handled the terror and made me so proud. When Obama became President all of that was gone. I felt bad for being an American, like we were apologizing for who we were and that I should be ashamed of who I am. Trump changed all of that again. He believed Americans were great and we always had been. I remember watch the results come in and my husband saying ""he's really done it, he's really going to win"". Unfortunately this has caused so much unrest in my family and I have realized my family is all liberal. They have all drank the Kool aid and buy everything the liberals tell them. They think I'm crazy for supporting Trump and that makes me sad. I'm so glad to have my husband who feels the same way I do. I'm also so lucky to have found this group. I am with all of you #WalkAwayCampaign",

"I'm so glad to be a part of this group. I've always been a #walkwith even though sometimes the party made it hard. With everything going on in the world today, I thought we were losing ground and was becoming worried about November. I believe that last 4 years the left has showed us how truly hateful they can be and it seemed as though they were growing in support. After joining this group, I have hope. I see all the people switching to our side and it does my heart good. I'm very fearful of what may happen if we lose this November, what kind of country I'd be leaving my kids. I can't fathom that thought. Republicans are pictured as racist hateful people, and we are not. I'm the first to help a stranger in need and think most of us would. Thank you for giving me hope, thank you all who have come across the aisle, thank you for being Americans first.",

"I Consider myself moderate by definition and unpolitical, it’s not a high priority to me but there are too many acts of terrorism being done by Democratic Party and I have a duty to stand against terrorism and support the police and president in restoring our country. The alternative is to support chaos and mob rule. When I heard that ppl tore down the Columbus statue I was upset because it means something to this country. I try to imagine what America would look like if they torched Lady Liberty 🗽 and I can’t imagine it. It’s such a part of this country. Many ppl are upset and they help to build this country. There’s a lot of things I don’t support and that’s why I walk away from Democrat and lean right. Enough is enough. I’m Voting for Trump.",

"My name is Christy. Growing up I watched as my neighborhood went from neighborly and family like to crack houses and broken homes. I am the oldest of 8 children, my mother worked until I was about 10 and she left my stepdad because he was physically abusive to me. We lived on Welfare after that for as long as I can remember. We were so poor and we struggled. My mother didn't drive, was in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. Alcohol and Drugs played significant roles as well as mental health issues. You see she came from an abusive home as well. However she always supported Democratic Leaders as did I. I always said vote for the lesser of 2 evils. Welfare paid the rent and kept the lights on and some kind of food on the table. I moved to VA in 1996 and lived there until 2009. Now I am back in NYS. Up until 2012 I paid attention to politics but not so close. Obamacare hit my family so hard and that's when I really started to pay attention. Then Trump took office and it totally changed my way of thinking in his first year. My family began to benefit and keep a little more of our earnings. We were able to finally buy a home of our own this past November and a new car finally in February. He may seem off script, but I feel like he knows something other Political Figures do not, or he truly just does care about America and the American Families. Forgive me for being political but I am never going to vote for a Democrat ever again. I will now be Libertarian or the closest Candidate to it.",

"Thank you for allowing me to join so many great Americans who have awoken and are standing up together in this cultural war we have had forced upon us. I was born into a Democrat family and grew up in Silver Spring MD in a Jewish community. I walked away about 6 months after 9/11 and I did so because I found the truth, that the man I voted for twice and thought was the greatest President ever and who I cried for the day he left office on Jan 20th 2001 had lied to me and every American about the terrorism that was occurring during his term and that led up to the 9/11 attacks on the USA. The day that I changed my voter registration from Democrat to Republican I became physically emotional, I was upset as if I was leaving my Family, the Dem Party, I realized that I was emotionally attached to that ideology and that I would NEVER EVER let my emotions take over my logic. I am now and have been active in the Conservative movements and am glad to be here. Brandon Straka is such an inspiration and may become one of the most important Leaders of our time. Thank you.",
